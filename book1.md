# Authors Note

This is a story I’ve had in my head for a while now, and this seems as good a place as any to get it out. I don’t know that it’s going to make a very good story, but I guess we’ll see how things go.

My main inspiration comes from tabletop games, video games, and books where magic plays some role. That might be games where you can play a spellcaster, or books where there are magic using characters, but I always find myself coming around to the same thought. What would happen if someone took the magic system present in the game or book, and applied a modern understanding of science to get the most out of their magical studies?

Now this has been done to some extent with “. This is not meant to be the same thing redone by a much worse writer. While HPMR showed the results of the “methods of rationality” applied to a magical world, it didn’t really focus on Harry trying to create new spells or magical items using his scientific knowledge. It’s this item and spell creation that I want to experiment with. I want to see what happens when knowledge of science, particularly chemistry and physics, are applied specifically to the **use** of magic.

It’s all well and good to say “The wizard throws a fireball” and get a big boom, but what if a clever individual with a decent memory of high school chemistry designs their own fireball with  explosives, which pound for pound will beat anything short of a nuke for destructive power.

For most spells and magic items I come across in any medium, game or book, I think up these “what ifs”. This story is my way of trying to get them out of my head and work them out.

The Mythbusters used tools and materials in ways for which they were never intended, this is meant to be spells and enchantments used in ways for which they were never intended. Except for this first bit. The guy needs to actually find someone to teach him magic after all. Probably many someones, I do like the idea of a magical school.

Critique is certainly welcome, I’m doing this mostly to clear my own thoughts but I also want to put out something that at least resembles a good story.



# Prologue / Chapter 1

Quinn was driving down the highway on his way back to Toronto, having spent the day hiking in Algonquin Park with some friends. He did his best to stretch in the driver’s seat of the small hatchback, muscles sore from the lengthy hike and then the past two hours spent sedentary in the car. It wasn’t terribly busy on the road, but the thunder storm that had convinced Quinn and his friends from U of T to head back to civilization hadn’t yet passed and was getting worse.

He could see some people had pulled off to the side of the road, hazard lights on, to try to wait out the worst of the storm. Quinn continued, trusting in the venerable Subaru’s four wheel drive and keeping a safe distance behind the vehicle ahead, rather than risk trying to pull over on the highway with semis speeding past. The storm was a rather large one, and he was rather interested in what seemed almost like a green tint to the flashes of lighting.

*Near a factory maybe? Though I feel like spewing enough stuff into the air to make the sky change colour should probably be illegal.*

The sky continued to gain this green tint; first it was only noticeable when the dark sky was lit up with a flash of lightning. Now it was becoming obvious despite the late hour and the storm blocking any light from the moon. Some of the other vehicles had started to slow down or speed up a little as people started rubbernecking and paid less attention to the road and the cars around.

Quinn focused on the road, rather than gawk at the odd storm, as he neared an overpass that curved gently. He didn’t really want to get into an accident if some old guy in a Volvo wasn’t paying attention and had to swerve or brake suddenly to keep from bumping into the guard rail. As it turned out, octogenarian drivers were not the cause of Quinn’s crash.

He had just reached the apex of the bridge when visibility suddenly dropped to zero. His heart rate spiked, it had seemed as if the fog had just boiled up around him. He became suddenly aware of just how fast he was going, on an overpass, a story or two above ground, with at least half a dozen other vehicles that were similarly blind. Quinn spent about a second considering what to do, did he maintain speed so as not to get rear-ended by someone behind who didn’t slow down, or did he stop to avoid running into someone that decided to stop. His thoughts were interrupted by a much worse problem, however, as he felt the car lurch and the bottom dropped out of his stomach.

*Oh this has* ***not*** *gone well.*

-----------------------

Quinn stamped on the brake pedal, for all the good it would do, hoping he’d hit the ground before he’d hit a… TREE! There was a white flash as Quinn lurched forwards against the seatbelt and the airbags went off in his face. Though the haze and disorientation of having just been in a high speed car accident he felt the rear of the car fall backwards, dragging him towards the earth. There was another sickening moment of weightlessness before his head slammed against the headrest as the rear end of car hit the ground.

*Please land on the wheels, please land on the wheels, please land on the- shit.*

Briefly vertical, the car fell backwards onto its roof and Quinn felt it start to slide down a slope as he finally lost consciousness.




# Chapter 2

I came to, which was a relief. It was also really painful, I felt like I had spent an hour in a tumble dryer. What had been essentially three consecutive car accidents, the first at highway speed, had taken a toll. I just laid there wheezing, chest hurting with every breath and my head hurting so much that it was hard not just to think but to see. I tried to find the door handle with my left hand, pushing myself up with my right. My arms felt stiff, numb, and hurt like hell. My hand bumped into something and I heard it shatter. That would be the window, aim lower Quinn. As I fumbled around trying to find the damned door handle, I started to feel very nauseous. I was doing my best not to panic but between the near-blindness, difficulty of breathing, and the massive headache I was getting more and more frantic when I felt someone touch my shoulder and gently press me back down.

“Shhh, shhhhh, you’re alright, you’re alright” soothed the young woman’s voice, in the same tone of voice one might use to calm a wild animal.

Ah right, hospital. I laid back down, stumbling around half blind after repeated head trauma probably wasn’t the best idea. Hopefully my neck wasn’t broken, though I couldn’t feel one of those immobilizing braces on my neck. I did my best to relax, and not throw up on myself or the nurse. I heard the nurse saying something else meant to be soothing when I passed out again.

I must have been out for a while, because when I woke again I could see sunlight streaming in through a window next to my bed. I found this somewhat disconcerting, since what I could see in the sunlight was not really what I was expecting from a hospital room. Rather than a room smelling faintly of antiseptic with off-white walls and a rather clinical approach to interior decorating, I found a room best described as ‘rustic’.

My vision was still rather blurry, and I twisted around in the bed trying to see if my glasses were sitting on one of the side tables. No such luck. I did see my watch and phone, but apparently whoever had pulled me out of the car hadn’t also gotten my glasses. I closed my eyes and relaxed into the bed, just trying to look around had made my head throb and my vision swim.

*Where the hell am I and why is where I am not a hospital? I do appreciate not being in the car anymore, but if I’ve gotten kidnaped by a crazy woman with a whole Florence Nightingale thing going on I’m going to be pissed. Alright, step 1, figure out where I am. Step 2, get to a hospital.*

I did my best to get a look around despite being without my glasses. The bed itself had a couple different blankets on it, both rough wool of the sort that someone’s grandma might make. Though it lacked in colour, these blanket were all shades of grey and brown. The sheets were made of rough linen, and is this mattress stuffed with straw? The bed was also surprisingly short, and was lying sort of diagonally across it with my knees bent to actually fit on the thing.

*Did I crash into the Upper Canada Village?*

The walls themselves were wood paneled and there was some rustic looking furniture in the room. The bed, a pair of side tables, a small desk with a simple chair, and a small dresser. It looked like rough timber, sanded down and stained a dark brown. It was simple furniture, but it had been made by someone that seemed to have some general idea of what they were doing. The corners were square and the surfaces were approximately level. It wouldn’t have looked out of place in an Elder Scrolls game. The floor was more sanded and stained timber, probably a good idea to walk around with shoes on though I don’t want any splinters in my feet.

There was a creak from the hallway, a light knock on the door, and a rather tall man stepped half into the room. It was hard to make out details without my glasses, but he seemed to have sharpish features and he seemed to have rather large eyes. His brown hair was pulled back into a short tail and just brushed the top of the doorway as he stepped in.

“Ah, you’re awake. I feared for sure that you’d be dead after I’d seen your carriage” said the tall man in a voice that made it sound like he was trying to talk around a mouthful of dirt.

I sat up in bed, which caused my head to throb again, and I realized for the first time that I was wearing only my boxers.

“I feel like I’m most of the way to being dead, where am I?”

“This is Essens, the nearest chapel is another town over so we brought you here to my tavern instead,” the man explained “You gave my daughter quite the fright, and she came running back shouting about a monster”

“I’m sorry about that, I thought I was still in the car and was trying to find the door handle. I must have knocked something off the end table and broke it.”

“Oh no, that’s not what I meant,” he replied “And it’s no trouble, we have plenty of mugs. No, Sila heard you crash last evening when she was heading back from mushroom picking. She ran back to us as we were just finishing up the harvest, she said she heard an ogre smashing through the forest. We found your carriage upside down in the brook, it looked all mashed up and there were bits of glass everywhere.”

“Last evening?” *Ogre? What?* “I hope you didn’t have to carry me far” *I’m either the subject of a really messed up prank or really far from home. I need to see the crash site.*

“Aye it’s about noon now, and the carriage was only about a mile-on up the hill,” he said “and yer quite a lot lighter than you look”

*Alright, as soon as I can stand up without passing out I need to get to the car. If this is a prank then I should be able to find something off about the scene. And if not… well I guess life just got much more interesting. Either way I want my stuff from the trunk, assuming it’s not all smashed to bits.*

“I’m Harpatro by the way,” he said while extending a hand “everybody just calls me Harp.”

I took the offered hand and shook it. The man’s hands were much smaller than I’d expected for someone of his size, and they were also somewhat cold despite the warm breeze blowing in through the window.

“Quinn,” I replied “And I appreciate the help”

At this point a young woman stepped into the room carrying a tray with a bowl of what smelled a lot like soup on it. At least she looked like a young woman, I had a hard time picking out her nose or eyes from the rest of her face even at this distance. She was only about half a head shorter than Harp.

“Here you are,” she said as she laid the tray on my lap. ”I thought you’d be hungry.” She seemed to have the same problem Harp did with actually pronouncing the words, but it was somewhat less noticeable with her.

I recognized the voice as the one that I had heard the previous… night? Either way, she was the same girl from earlier.

“Ah, this is Sila” Harp explained.

“Thank you Sila, for the food and for letting someone know where I was. And my name is Quinn by the way”

“You’re welcome,” she said in a quiet voice, brushing back her long brown hair “It was really no trouble.”

“Well you just relax Quinn, eat up and take your time resting,” said Harp in a gentle voice.

“Uhhh… shouldn’t I be paying you? It’s not fair to burden your family to take care of a stranger. If I can find my wallet I have some--”

“No no no,” he interrupted. “It’s no trouble, no trouble at all. We just brought in the harvest and it’s been a good year. You worry about getting better, if you really want to help out it can wait until you’re feeling better.”

“Um, is there anything you want me to bring you?” Sila asked in a near whisper

“I was wondering where the rest of the stuff I had on me was,” I said looking over at my phone and watch which were sitting on the side table. “And maybe a book or something? If it’s not too much trouble.”

“A book?” It was impossible to read her facial expression without my glasses, but from her voice she sounded somewhat surprised. She looked up at Harp, who I guessed was her father.

*I guess in this fictional medieval village no one can read.*

“Oh Pell keeps a few books on the shelf downstairs, why don’t you fetch a couple for him Sila. And the rest of your things are just under the table there,” he said, pointing under the side table to my left.

*One guy can read, Pell, he’s the designated smart guy.*

I thanked him and he left the room, his daughter scurrying after him, door remaining slightly ajar. I leaned down, which caused my head to throb in protest, and picked up my jeans and jacket from under the table. My shoes, shirt, and socks were all there as well. They’d been cleaned, no mud from my previous hike in the park or unintentional bath in a brook. I went through the pockets of my jeans and found my wallet, and got my tiny Swiss Army knife out of the pocket of my jacket. It was the one that had come with my watch so it contained only a knife, file, scissors, and tweezers. I had long since lost the toothpick.

I ate while digging though my wallet. It was a delicious vegetable stew, and my stomach growled audibly when I got the first proper whiff of the stuff. In the wallet there was 85$ in bills, nine something in change, and a bunch of cards. Library card, student ID, OHIP card, debit card, and driver’s licence. Also had a slim 16GB flash drive, and a bunch of business cards and buy 9 get 1 free cards for different stores. So I hadn’t been robbed, and I couldn’t feel any new scars on my lower back so they hadn’t helped themselves to a kidney.

*Seems like a lot of trouble to go through to prank someone. I really fucking hope this is a prank.*

I put everything back into my wallet and dropped it onto the side table and picked up my watch. It was a nice watch, Swiss Military, all titanium construction. It reported that it was currently 12:15 on Apr-10 and generally seemed to be in good shape.

*April 10th, that matches what they said. Yesterday was the 9th, though didn’t Harp say that they’d just brought in the harvest? I’m pretty sure that most crops get harvested in fall. Alright, moment of truth.*

I reached over and picked up my phone, and while the screen had apparently been cracked in the crash it still had 68% battery remaining.

“I’m sorry”

I looked up startled, to see Sila standing in the doorway with a couple of books.

“I shouldn’t have been going through your things, I’m sorry, and when that thing lit up it startled me and I dropped it. Did I break it?” she said almost too quickly to follow, in her demure half-whisper.

“Ah…,” I sighed “It’s okay, the screen is cracked but it looks like it still works, what have you got there?” I said, changing the subject.

“These are the books you wanted,” she said lamely.

*I can see that*

“I don’t know what they’re about but these are the ones I sometimes see Pell reading when he’s here”

*Right, she’s supposedly illiterate.*

“Thank’s,” I said as I took the books from her, reading the titles

“Um, what are they about?” she asked.

“This one,” I said, indicating the smaller of the two books “is titled ‘The Triumph of Tigoro’”

“I know that one, sometimes Moss tells the story on feast day” she said excitedly.

I nodded, and hefted the larger book “This one is titled ‘Local Elardian History’ which I’m guessing is a history book”

*A clever writer could throw together a convincing ancient legend. But putting together the history of a whole… city? Country? Continent? Would be a lot harder to do convincingly. Though this book was volunteered to me, so it might be a clever double bluff. Hand me a seeming consistent history of a fictional… whatever it was about, and let me convince myself that no one could fake this. Though why the hell bother? I’m a computer science student from Toronto. Someone with a lot of money must be very bored.*

“Oh, do you want me to get you a different one? That one sounds kinda boring,” she said, head bowed slightly.

“No, it’s fine. I’m interested in history anyway,” I replied.

“Oh of course, sorry, I should have realized,” she said quietly, turning a little pink.

I realized at this point that I was sitting in a bed, most of the way to being naked, in front of the girl. *I guess she’s trying to play the innocent village girl, and so she’s not supposed to be the sort of person that spends much time alone with half naked men in quiet bedrooms.* I reached down to where the rest of my clothes lay and pulled on my shirt. This seemed to settle her slightly, and she left after taking away the dinner tray.

Once she left I checked my phone. No messages, no missed calls, and no signal. No 4G, zero bars, no Wi-Fi hotspots nearby. And it was my phone, I had a utility on it that would let it boot into a second hidden OS. Even if someone had been looking for it they’d not be able to find it easily, and since you needed an encryption key to get into it they couldn’t simply make a copy with the same hidden OS. If they had done it my code wouldn’t have worked to unlock the hidden portion. This was my phone, and it hadn’t been tampered with. I could tell as much from the diagnostic tools I had hidden in my secret partition. No panicked texts or calls from anyone that should have been expecting me home, and no records of deletion. Technically nothing is hack-proof, but you can only take suspicion so far before you start to doubt your own sanity.

It didn’t look like anyone was using a phone jammer either, my tools should have picked that up. One trouble with jamming is that it’s ‘active’. In layman’s terms the jammer needs to be shouting louder than the nearest cell tower. This means that the phone is picking something up, it’s just not a very useful something. A normal phone would just register no signal and the battery would drain as it tried to get the cell tower back. My phone however is special, mostly because I like having gadgets and you can cram a surprising number of tools onto a rooted Android. I would have been able to tell if someone was jamming the phone.

I turned it off. It wouldn’t do any good anyway without a network connection. I resolved to check it occasionally to see if I’d gotten any messages and to see if I could get any signal, but for now it was an expensive brick.

-----------

It was a few days before I could really walk much further than the bathroom, which surprisingly was not just a hole in the ground. There was a sort of proto-toilet looking thing in an actual washroom, which was nice since chamber pots seemed a little undignified. It only took a few days for me to read every book in the whole village, which sounds impressive until you discover that there were only 5, and had come to some worrying conclusions.

I was still hesitant to accept anything I saw as given, I was ready for someone to jump out of the bushes with a camera shouting “PUNKD” with all the actors falling over themselves laughing about how I seemed convinced that I’d traveled back in time, but I was getting concerned. The Elardian History book seemed pretty realistic. Now I’m studying Computer Science at U of T, and not history, but I have taken several History courses. They take up the bulk of my electives, and it wouldn’t be too much work to graduate with History as a second major. Expecting the history book to be a fabrication, I had thought it would be the work of a few writers brainstorming something that would make an interesting history for a fantasy novel. Instead I got what looked and felt like an actual history book. It didn’t help that it seemed to be somewhat corroborated by ‘The Triumph of Tigoro’ and the rest of the books, all of which recounted local legends. Tigoro was mentioned in the history book as a great general, like Leonidas except with less kicking Persian dudes into pits and more sneaky Trojan horse type stuff. ‘The Triumph’ was essentially the same story, but told as a heroic epic, rather than as a summary of events and important dates. It was a similar situation with the other books I had read during those few days. They were either a heroic take on specific characters, or more kid friendly stories that seemed to have enough behind them to place them properly in the history I had read.

*I really need to get back to my car.*

------


I had reset the date function on my watch, I left the time as-is, but the morning I woke up after the crash would be Jan-01 and it works a hell of a lot better than making tally marks on the wall. Besides, I didn’t really want to upset Harp my gouging up his walls if this turns out not to be a big joke.

The watch read ‘Jan-04’ when Sila suggested we have supper downstairs instead of in my room. I’d gotten a little bored after finishing all the books and my head was feeling marginally better so I agreed to go make the arduous journey down the stairs.

I stood up, careful not to hit my head on the ceiling like I had the first couple times I’d gotten up to relieve myself. My initial assessment of Harp and Sila had been that they were near my height. With my vision still blurry without glasses, all I could see was that Harp brushed the top of the doorway. From this I guessed that he was a couple inches taller than me, putting him at 6’ 8” or 6’ 9”. Sila was about half a head shorter than Harp so I figured somewhere in the 6’ 2” to 6’ 4” range. I was wrong. By a lot.

The ceiling was only 6ft from the floor, which meant I couldn’t stand up straight. The doorway was only a little more than 5ft high which put Harp, apparently a ‘tall’ man, at 5’ 4” at most.

*It* ***is*** *like Upper Canada Village, I remember going there in elementary school. Even then I was tall enough that I’d needed to duck under doorways. This place seems built on the same scale.*

Sila herself only came up to a little above my elbow, and the height difference had surprised her the first time I had gotten out of bed. It had also added somewhat to her shyness, but she had been getting over it once we got to know each other better. She’d come up to talk to me occasionally over the past couple days, or she’d eat in with me when she took me my meal so we’d had time to talk. She told me about what the village was like, and asked plenty of questions about me that I couldn’t really decide how to answer. I was still trying to figure out whether this was all an elaborate scheme, or that I really did travel to some other world.

We entered the common room and she led me over to a table where Harp was sitting with two men I hadn’t met yet. One man seemed to have green hair, Moss I’m guessing? The other had the same brown hair that Sila and Harp shared, and seemed like the beefiest guy at the table. Harp and Moss, assuming it was Moss, both were pretty fit and had the sort of muscle tone you get if you work with your hands for a living. The third guy however looked like he could bench about 250lbs without a whole lot of trouble. I’m guessing blacksmith? Probably-Moss and Probably-Blacksmith were playing what I was sure had to be chess. Probably-Moss looked up from the game as we approached, and his eyes got rather wide when he saw me. At this reaction the other two turned to look over at Sila and I approach.

“Quinn was feeling a little better so I thought that it would be good to eat down here for a change” Sila explained to those at the table.

“Please, sit,” said Harp, pushing out the chair across from him with his foot “I knew you weren’t quite a small man, but you gotta have giant’s blood in you to be so tall. Pell, Moss, this is Quinn”

“Hello, it’s nice to meet the two of you,” I said, shaking hands with the two men “I believe I’ve been borrowing some of your books Pell.”

“Ah, someone else who appreciates them, which ones have you been reading?” Pell asked, in what sounded like a fairly normal voice.

*No dirt chewing for Pell, he’s definitely designated smart guy.*

“All of them’,” I replied, “I finished the last one this morning, I haven’t really had anything to do except sit and read.”

Pell raised his eyebrows, or at least, I think he did. I was really hoping my glasses would be in the car and not smashed to pieces. “You are quite the quick reader, though I guess it only makes sense.”

“Makes sense?” I asked, raising my own eyebrows.

“Well you must either be a Lord or a great Mage, it’s only sensible,” Explained Pell, in a tone of voice that seemed to indicate that he believed that what he’d said must be the absolute truth. “So, which is it?”

“Uh,” I hesitated, “Why would you say that?” I said slowly.

“Well you speak with more confidence and clarity than even the Baron,” he said, “and you apparently have a carriage made of tin and glass. I’m not even sure what the wheels are made of, they can only be the creation of a Mage. Your hands look like they’ve never seen a day of work. So either you are yourself a Mage, or you’re a Lord who’s paid a Mage to create such a splendid carriage for him.”

*Mage? This guy believes in magic? He’s definitely right about the hands thing though.*

“I’m afraid I’m neither of those things Pell, I am educated, but I’m no Lord and no Mage,” I explained. *What the hell am I supposed to tell these guys? To hell with it, let’s try the truth.* “I’m afraid what I really am, is lost. I don’t really know where I am or how I got here”

Moss harrumphed, and seemed to take pleasure in my statement. He jabbed a finger at Harp “Didn’t I tell you? But no, Moss is just a storyteller trying to make up a new story”

I looked over a Sila who had sat beside me and I gave her a questioning look. She sort of nodded towards Moss and I looked back towards him.

“Moss, just because-“started Harp, before Moss interrupted

“A man drops from the sky in a flying metal carriage and you think a Banestorm is out of the question?” Moss seemed to match Pell in diction, which only made sense if he was given to public speaking.

*What the hell is a Banestorm?*

“What the h- what is a Banestorm?” I said, doing my best not to swear in front of what was as far as I knew a very sheltered group of people.

Pell and Harp both opened their mouths to speak, but we’d gotten the storyteller started and he wasn’t about to stop.

Moss assumed a deeper voice, and when he spoke his words had a rhythm to them “A Banestorm is a mighty verdant thunderstorm; it seizes the heroes and champions of worlds beyond the Veil and ensures that they are brought to those with great need. If a Banestorm has brought you here, it is because here is where you are needed.”

It was kinda quiet after he finished speaking, and I was glad that no one else was in the common room yet. *Damn. Why is this guy working for some twisted prankster with too much time and too much money? He should have his own show.*

“I don’t think I really make a very good hero, I’m not all that brave. And I don’t think I’m the champion of anything other than procrastination. I wouldn’t even know where to start”

*Serpentine powder, 75% saltpeter, 15% charcoal, 10% sulphur.*

“I think that’s enough for now Moss, let the boy rest.” Harp said, trying to calm Moss who seemed rather caught up in himself.

“How about a game of Zatrikion,” Pell suggested “You said you were educated and Moss here has all but lost. Know how to play?”

I looked at the board, and yeah, I was pretty sure that this was Chess alright. Moss had indeed all but lost. He had only a pawn and his king and it looked like Pell was trying to chase the king around on the board with a horse and two rooks.

“Sure, why not. This game is called Chess where I come from. Could you just go over the pieces quickly, some parts of the game might be different from what I’m used to.”

Pell went over what each piece did briefly, and there were three rules that I knew were relatively modern inventions that I needed to know about. The first was the queen being able to move as she did, and the pawn being able to move two spaces if it hasn’t yet moved, and castling. In Zatrikion castling and the pawns first turn were out, but the queen could still move as she liked.

As minor as the changes were it still changed the game quite a bit. Without castling it was harder to protect the king, but with the restrictions on the pawn the game was slightly slower. I lost the first game, but not by a lot. The second game I managed to force a stalemate, though it was in Pell’s favour.

“A third game?” I asked

“Certainly,” said Pell, “but when I play with Moss and the others we generally play for money”

“Oh no you don’t, don’t go trying to take the boy’s money.” Harp chastised.

*That’s the second time he’s called me boy.*

I withdrew my wallet from my pocket, “How much money are we talking about here? I don’t even know if my coins are worth anything to you” and I dumped out the coins onto the table in front of me.

It wasn’t much. 9.35$ Four toonies, one loonie, a quarter, and a dime. Canadian coins are pretty much just steel with nickel plating.

“Oh my,” said Sila, picking up the quarter. She’d been quiet up till now, though she’d managed to work her chair over until it was nearly touching mine. “Is this?”

“Nay girl, it’s not silver,” said Pell and he inspected the toonie “Though I’m not quite sure what it is.”

*Damn, not the blacksmith. A blacksmith would recognize steel when he saw it.*

“It’s steel,” I said “All the coins are steel, the only difference is the type of metal used to plate them. The silver colour comes from nickel, and the gold colour from brass”

“Steel? I’ve not heard of that before”

*Bronze age medieval village?*

“Steel is an alloy of iron and carbon, it’s very much like iron except it’s a bit stronger and more flexible. Steel won’t shatter like iron will.”

“Tell you what, I’ll buy one of these ones from you,” he said, indicating the toonies “I’ll give you 5 drachm for it, the workmanship is amazing and it would be nice as a showpiece for my smithy”

*BLACKSMITH! Called it.*

“Deal,” I said, scooping the rest of the coins into the little pouch in my wallet “Now how much is 5 drachm?”

I got a strange look from Pell and Harp before Moss pointed at me and said “Bane. Storm.” He punctuated each syllable with a jab of the finger.

Harp waved a hand at Moss “I charge 1 drachm a night for a room and two meals here, it can be more in a city though”

I slid four of the coins across the table to Harp.

“Ay, I already said it was no trouble. People got to take care of each other and money doesn’t factor into it”

“Alright,” I said, and I made a neat stack of four coins and set them next to the ch-Zatrikion board.

“Now hold on Quinn, don’t go betting all that against Pell. He’s real good and that’s about 2 days pay for most people” chided Harp.

“Well if you insist on not taking my money I’ve got to give it to someone. Pell is the obvious choice”

Harp sighed, and sat back in his chair. Pell and I began our game, and I had my strategy ready. He relied mostly on trying to whittle down his opponents pieces, leaving him with more than his opponent. But from there it generally deteriorated into him trying to chase the opposing king around the board. He hadn’t learned any openings, or any closing moves. He was careful how he made each move and didn’t tend to make mistakes but he was really only thinking a move or two ahead. I had lost the first and tied the second trying to get one of the openings I knew of to work with the altered rules. The lack of castling and the double move for pawns were both changes that fouled up a lot of the openers I had learned, but I had remembered the opening I wanted to use for game three. Pell was a good player, and had clearly played quite a lot but he hadn’t actually practiced, and he didn’t have any chess books. Probably none had even yet been written, and he certainly didn’t have the internet.

One modified Kings Indian Attack heralded the beginning of a much more interesting game. A lot of the mid-games I’d learned relied on the missing rules at least in some way so I had to wing a lot of it, but I still had the knowledge of several hundred years of experienced players to draw upon. Pell probably learned from his father, and his strategies were likely ones picked up from the tiny population of Zatrikion players in this town and the ones around it. Thirty minutes later I was 4 drachm richer.

Moss hooted and some of the spectators that had filed in around dinner congratulated me, I got slapped on the back a lot and tried not to make my discomfort obvious. I’ve never really been a fan of people touching me. “I don’t think I’ve ever seen Pell beaten like that,” said Moss. “Well done, and you tried to tell the boy to keep his money”

“I don’t suppose anyone else wants to play?” I said, grinning

One of the spectators opened his mouth to agree, before the woman next to him speared him with a glare. Probably the wife.

I didn’t manage to get myself another mark, but Pell did want to play some more. We played three more games, all with a one drachm bet. Pell managed to force a stalemate on one of them, but I won the other two and went to bed that night with 10 shiny new drachm.

-----------------------------------------------------

It was a week after the crash that I decided I couldn’t wait any longer. I was still in pretty rough shape and my head hurt like hell, but I hadn’t died yet of internal bleeding or a brain haemorrhage so I figured I was going to recover. I pulled on my jeans and shoes, resolving to walk all the way to the car and back without passing out or vomiting everywhere. I had been surprisingly successful at the whole, not vomiting thing. I knew that nausea was one of the symptoms of a concussion, and hoped that the fact that I’d not yet thrown up was an indicator that the concussion was not that bad.

“Oh!” Came Sila’s voice, “Are you leaving? You can’t be leaving now, you still look like you’re about to fall over most of the time.”

“You don’t need to worry about me, I just want to go see if there’s any of my things left in the ca-uh, carriage” I replied, waiting for an excuse that would keep me away from it.

“Okay, why don’t I go with you? You might need help.” Sila said brightly.

Sila had been spending a lot of time around me lately. I was doing my best not to get drawn into something I wasn’t ready for, but she seemed like she was doing her best to be helpful so I acquiesced.

“Alright, do you know if anyone has been there yet to look around in the carriage?”

“I don’t think so, there’s glass everywhere and Pappa told them to leave it alone until you had a chance to go check on your things”

“Hmmm,” I said, thinking “That was nice of him, I do have some stuff in the car that I want to get to”

I followed her downstairs and could hear Harp and Pell talking in the common room. I heard my name mentioned, but they stopped talking and looked up when Sila and I got downstairs. The ceiling in the common room was just tall enough for me to stand properly.

“Ah Quinn, you’re looking a bit better. You here to steal away more of my hard earned money?” he said in a friendly manner.

“No, I wanted to go see if I can salvage anything from my carriage,” I responded.

“Ah, do you mind if I come with you?” Asked Pell as he stood, and I could see he was wearing a blacksmith’s apron. “I want to get a look at your carriage is made of.”

“Certainly, I’m not sure where it is anyway.”

-----------------------------------------------------

Pell, Sila, and I walked through the village towards a hill in the distance. We had been walking for a short while when Pell spoke up.

“You mentioned that steel was an alloy of iron and carbon, do you know much about metallurgy?”

“Ah, maybe?” I hedged, thinking to the many hours spent playing Dwarf Fortress. “I think where I’m from is somewhat farther along when it comes to metallurgy as a field of study, but I’m not an expert by any definition. Why do you ask?”

“Well I’ve been thinking that I could use some help around the forge. Maybe you can show me how it is that steel is made, maybe you can’t. But you seem like the smart sort and I’m without a son to pass my trade onto.”

*Blacksmith, not a bad profession if I have to pick one. Smiths were generally the more affluent people in town and their skills were always in demand. My last name, Angove, even means smith.*

“That sounds like a rather good offer, I don’t know what else I could really do here. I think I’m going to need to do quite a bit of learning though.” I replied, not really certain what I’d agreed to.

“Oh it will be fine Quinn,” said Sila excitedly, turning to face me “I’m sure you’ll be just fine at it”

----------

We left the town and they led me out to the remains of my mighty Subaru. I survived that? Damn. It was sitting wheels up in a shallow stream that ran down the hill into the town. The water was barely deep enough to dampen the upholstery on the inside of the roof. Sila hadn’t been kidding about the glass. Every single window had shattered into tiny cubes, and the cubes were spread all around the car and up the side of the hill that lead to the forest. The grass in a mostly straight line up into the woods had been mostly flattened from the car sliding down the hill, but in two spots the sod was all torn up.

*It looks like the car rolled a couple of times after I passed out.*

I found both of the wing mirrors as I walked up the hill, broken off when the car rolled. My head started to throb as I continued walking up towards the tree line, and the nausea started to come back. It wasn’t as bad as before, but it was definitely still there. I found the tree, trees actually, that I had hit. It looked like I came in about 30ft off the ground, which made sense considering the height of the overpass, and hit two younger and shorter trees before slamming into an older and taller pine tree. The first two trees were missing about the top five or six feet, with the smashed bits lying in the underbrush around. I hadn’t been so lucky with the third tree. Instead of smashing off the top of the tree and slowing down a bit I had hit about the midpoint of the tree’s height. The tree stayed exactly where it was and it was the car that got smashed. I could see the impression of the back bumper on the ground under where I must have hit the old tree.

There was one thing conspicuously absent. The overpass? Well that one was obvious, there was no big concrete bridge with cars screaming along at 100kph, but that wasn’t actually the most concerning thing missing. The ground around the crash site, actually all the ground I’d walked across to get here, was rather damp and the grass had the squishy feeling you get when the ground is really soft. Maybe they cut the first two trees and bashed them up a little to make it look like a car and not a saw had done it. Maybe they’d brought the car here to the top of the hill and pushed it down, causing it to roll and slide into the stream.

Maybe all of that happened, but where the hell were the tracks? They’d need a flatbed to bring in the car judging from the state it was in. Assuming it didn’t get bogged down in the soft earth there should be two big rents in the ground leading to and from the tree. The ground should be torn up a little from the people they’d need to help with this. Hell I could see clearly where I’d torn up the sod where I’d walked up the hill. Even a couple people moving around here, getting things into position should have left some evidence. Instead, no footprints, no tyre tracks, nothing. And no damn big overpass either.

I looked back down the hill. Pell’s blurry form was poking around the car, Sila standing nearby. I could see her looking up at me, and I could see some hopefulness in the way she was standing there with her hands clasped in front of her.

*Fuck.*

---

I started back down the hill.

*I’m going to drive myself crazy if I keep playing mind games with myself. This was no prank. And I can’t keep on hedging, waiting for someone to jump out and start laughing at me. Everything I see, everything I’ve worked out tells me that this is the real deal. Maybe I’m crazy, but doubting my sanity is going to get me nowhere. Either I am crazy and there’s not really anything I can do about it, or I’m perfectly sane and doubting that is just going to push me over the edge. I’m sane, I’m on a continent called Elardia, in the kingdom of Rhona, and I live in a tavern in a town called Essens. And this is my life now.*

I dug around in the front of the car until I found my glasses. Thankfully the lenses weren’t damaged, and I only needed to bend one of the arms a little to get them to sit properly on my head. I finally got my first good look around, vision sharp and clear. I saw Pell taking a pair of tin snips to a piece of the front left quarter panel that was warped and smashed. I noticed for the first time that his ears were pointed, it wasn’t World of Warcraft level pointiness, but they could have taken a mould of his ear for the Vulcans in the new Star Trek movie. He was about the same height as Harp, probably 5’ 3” or 5’ 4”. Brown hair like Harp’s, drawn back into a short tail. His eyes were quite a bit larger than any human’s eyes could be. He didn’t wear a beard, and his skin had the same smoothness you might see on someone who had shaved not an hour before. *Elf*. I became rather aware of the fact that I hadn’t shaved in over a week. I raised a hand to my jaw to rub at the stubble that had been accumulating there.

I turned to look at Sila. She had long brown hair that trailed down past her shoulders. She was wearing a linen dress that had probably been dyed light blue quite a long time ago and it had faded quite a lot. She had fine features and prominent cheekbones, her chin came to a delicate point. She had full lips, slightly parted, and the same huge eyes. They were brown like her hair. It was a deep brown, brown like pools of chocolate so deep you could drown in them. I could see the way she was looking at me, and I was pretty sure she’d been giving me the same look since I’d first spoken to her. It was a look I couldn’t ever remember being directed at myself, and it was a look that made me realize just what I lacked.

And it was exactly what I didn’t want.

*Is this what the rest of my life is going to be then? I’m going to learn Pell’s trade and work his smithy when he’s gone? Am I going to marry Sila and have a family, what the hell would I even tell any children I’d have? I could never relate to the world that they’d be growing up in. Am I supposed to live in a world where bloodletting is considered treatment and people think that it’s bad spirits that make people sick? I don’t want this, I’m not Moss’s damn hero. I’m a computer geek from Canada, I’m used to a level of luxury that’s probably even beyond what this world’s Kings can match. I’m used to a level of technology and constant entertainment that this world can never match. And there’s Sila standing there, looking at me like that. This might be the first time anyone has ever looked at me like that, but it just isn't enough. Fuck I’m a selfish bastard, but I can’t live like some medieval peasant for the rest of my life.*

“Sila, could you give me a hand here?” I said, trying to force down the angsty navel gazing and keep the bitterness out of my voice. “I want to gather my stuff and head back to the tavern, my head is killing me”

Sila and I gathered my things while Pell cut some pieces from the bodywork with his tinsnips, and we headed back. Once I was back in my room, Sila shadowing me still, I spread out what I had gathered on the bed.


# Chapter 3

I could see Quinn sitting with his back to one of the old oak trees just downhill from the village. The leaves had started to change their colours, and Quinn’s oak tree looked like it might have been burning with all the oranges and reds in its leaves. He was reading one of Pell’s books again and seemed lost in thought. He had his chin propped up on one hand and his brow was furrowed as he looked down at the book. He’d been recovering rather quickly, but ever since we had been to the remains of his carriage the previous week he had seemed more distant.

“I brought you something,” I said, which seemed to startle him. He jumped slightly and looked up.

“Oh sorry, I just thought you might be hungry,” And I held out the picnic basket. He seemed to hesitate slightly before answering. It was something he did a lot when talking to me, and I had noticed him doing it more and more often in the past week.

“Thank you Sila,” he said, placing one of those little paper cards into the book and closing it.

As I spoke I laid out the blanket that I’d kept folded under the basket’s handle “You’ve been reading that book a lot, what’s so special about it?”

“It’s the history book you brought me the first day after the crash, I read it the once to pass the time, but I didn’t know what I was looking for then. I’m trying to do a better job of actually studying it now.”

“How do you find something new in a book? You said that you’d read it already.” I asked, as I set out the lunch I had made for the two of us.

Auntie Crisa had been the one to teach me how to cook, and she told me that cooking a good meal for your betrothed was one of the best ways to spend time together without being improper. Auntie Crisa seemed to want to make sure that everything was ‘proper’, but it seemed like good advice even if Quinn and I weren’t betrothed. So I put together a picnic for the two of us and I’d made everything myself, I didn’t have much to work with but Quinn seemed to like the stew I’d made for him the first day we’d met. So I’d made some more of that and wrapped up the bowls in cloth to keep them warm. I also had made some rolls which were fresh out of the oven and kept warm by the stew. I brought along just a little bit of butter to go with them. This was the first time since he’d started taking his meals in the common room that’d we’d sat and eaten together without anyone else bothering us. Sure we’d have dinner in the common room, but it wasn’t the same. There were always people sitting at other tables, or he’d be playing Zatrikion with Pell. Pell was also stealing Quinn away, often when I went looking for Quinn when Pappa didn’t need my help I’d find that he was with Pell learning how to run the forge.

“Moss and Pell seemed to think that my being a Mage was entirely possible, and I can tell just from looking at the people in the village that I’m not the same species as the rest of you. Though it doesn’t seem to bother you, which seems to suggest that you’re used to seeing people like me, or at least people not like yourselves. I’m looking to see if I can find references to magic or to the different races. I’m still having a hard time reconciling everything I see around me and everything that’s happened with what I know. Or at least what I thought I knew. Only trouble is, this book reads more like a list of dates and important battles. There’s not a lot of detail given for any one event.” Quinn replied, as he started to eat.

Quinn spoke a lot differently than anyone I’d ever heard. He spoke even more precisely than the Baron or any of his sons, but unlike them he never seemed to raise his voice. Even to be heard in the common room when it was noisy at the table all he would do is repeat himself. Instead the others around the table would quiet down so they could hear what he was saying. The Baron and his sons seemed to try to control a group by being the one to shout the loudest. His voice was also deeper, and he seemed very deliberate about his wording, taking his time with each word. It gave his voice a low rumbling quality.

“Don’t they have Mages where you’re from? And haven’t you ever seen an elf or a dwarf or a gnome before?” I asked.

“No actually, I take it that you believe in magic? And I’m guessing you’re an, elf?” He said hesitantly “Which is not to say that I don’t believe you, it’s just where I’m from the only ‘magic’ is stage magic, sleight of hand, and trickery”

“Oh it’s alright,” I said brightly, happy that he was asking about me “I’ve never actually seen anyone do magic, but I’m an elf, and I’ve seen dwarves and gnomes sometimes when they pass through town. There’s even a gnome in town now, he’s probably going to be the last trader we’re going to get before the snow closes the pass out of the valley. What about you? You can’t be something like an orc, you’re the right size, but you’re the wrong colour and always very polite.”

“Thank you,” Quinn said, smiling, “Well I’m a human, but I don’t really know if that explains anything if you’ve never met a human before. What about these gnomes and dwarves, why do they sometimes come through the town?”

“Well dwarves have some of their mountain-homes north of here and I guess when they travel they sometimes come through the valley. Gnomes sometimes live in the foothills near dwarven mountains, and we always get a couple gnome traders in the fall as they’re heading back home. The valley is supposed to be one of the safer ways for them to get back, and they always like to trade for food from the farms”

Quinn finished his bite of roll and asked “What makes the valley here safer than the other options? I don’t even know really how this place is laid out”

“Well the valley is this strip between the two mountain ranges, you see the one over there?” I said pointing to the mountains to the east, ”and the ones over there?” I said pointing west, ”Well they stretch really far north, and they sort of meet up if you go far enough. Pell said that the dwarves have their mountain home up there somewhere in the north. There’s five villages all spread through the length of the valley, which means that the trader can stop and get supplies every night. The only people that really come to the tavern from outside the valley are the gnomes and dwarves passing through. There’s more mountains past the ones you can see, and there’s valleys and other ways through but none of the other valleys go the whole way north, and the passes are hard to get through even in summer. Especially if you’ve got a couple of horse drawn carts.”

There hadn’t really been anything I could help him with once he was able to get up and walk around, and he always asked someone else when he had a question. Usually it was Harp or Pell. It was nice to have him pay the same sort of attention to me for a change. It was a little frightening though, he always looked whoever he was talking to right in the eye and it was a very intense look. They were only half the size of an elf’s eyes and were shaded by a prominent brow. They were green like Moss's eyes, though Quinn's were a much darker shade.

“So there’s a trader in town, and he’s a gnome,” he said, seeming to think about it “Well I suppose I should go see what he has on offer. I might be able to get some of the materials I’ll need for a blast furnace”

I quickly started to gather the things, not wanting him to go without me “I hope you don’t mind if I come along?” I said as I cleaned up.

“Sure,” he said deliberately “I’ve not really had to try to trade for anything yet, Harp is still refusing to take my money. It would be good to have you along, I’m still not sure about the worth of these coins anyways”

I felt a little tightness in my chest, *Auntie Crisa always takes care of her husband’s money* “Y-es I can help you with that”

Quinn stood up, and up, and up from where he was sitting. He really was a giant, I don’t think I’ve ever seen anyone as tall as Quinn. He didn’t look quite like anyone else either. He had the sharp features of an elf, the of squareish face and jaw of a dwarf, and the close cut brown hair and stubble of a gnome. It should have made him look ugly with such a mix of different features, but the fine cheekbones and strong jaw darkened by his short beard blended together into something handsome and entirely unique. His skin was pale, like a dwarf’s or a Lord’s. No one could ever mistake him for a dwarf, towering head and shoulders over even her father who was the tallest man in the whole valley.

*I can see why Pell thought he was a Lord.*

Fair skin, soft hands, and absolutely perfect teeth. I’ve had always taken good care of my teeth, but I’d still cover them with my hand or bow my head when I smiled. Some were crooked, a one or two were missing, and those not missing were slightly yellowed. It was nothing terrible, but it seemed woefully inadequate compared to Quinn. Quinn’s looked like they might be made of marble, and they all stood straight like perfect little soldiers, not a single one out of place, and not a single one missing.

It’s why I’ve been trying so hard to get his notice, Quinn was amazing, and he was probably the only man in the entire valley other than Anthior that wasn’t already married or betrothed to someone else. I can remember the last time Auntie Crisa took me to meet Anthior, it had not gone well. Auntie had been taking me to see Antior every feast day, and I knew exactly what Auntie was thinking. The Baron trying to find a wife for his sixth and youngest son, and I was probably the only girl in the whole valley that hadn’t yet found someone. Anthior was a little shorter and that seemed to upset him a lot, when he wasn’t being cruel to me he was trying to put his greasy hands all over me. He tried to pull me down onto his lap last time and that’s when I finally slapped him, and I did it hard enough to leave a mark. Auntie was furious, she seemed to think it was ‘improper’, but it had made Anthior let go and I haven’t been made to go see him on any of the feast days since then. I just wish that Quinn would be half as interested in pulling me into his lap, I wouldn’t mind a little manhandling from him. The couple of times I had brushed against his hand or his chest had been a little exciting and I’ve been doing my best to come up with more excuses to do it. His hands were hot to the touch, and his jumper, a ‘hoodie’ he called it, was so soft. I just want to sit in his lap and bury my face in it.

*I wish I hadn’t told him about the trader, otherwise we might have been able to sit here for a while longer.*

Quinn helped me fold up the blanket and I tucked it back under the handle of the basket.

“What’s a blast furnace anyway? Is it something Pell needs for the forge?”

“Yes and no,” said Quinn “You remember the coins? They were all made of steel, and to make steel you need a blast furnace. Mostly, well if we want to make steel we need a blast furnace I guess. Pell can already work with bronze and the other softer metals just fine, he’s been doing it for longer than I’ve been alive. Iron however is apparently only worked by the forges in the larger cities, and even then it’s only made in very small batches. Steel is apparently unknown, though I’d be willing to bet that some of the larger city forges are actually turning out low grade steel, rather than iron, even if it’s only by accident. I need a blast furnace to have any hope of producing steel. Even if I can’t quite manage to get it perfect, whatever I do manage to assemble will probably give Pell what he needs to start working with iron. That could be a big help, since apparently it’s not really possible to get iron out this far. At least not for any economical price.”

Quinn continued his explanation and I did my best to understand what he was saying “I honestly can’t remember if it’s the higher airflow that the blast furnace provides that allows iron and carbon to alloy properly, or if it’s the higher temperature. I’m guessing it’s some combination of the two, probably the increased airflow mainly serves to raise the temperature in the forge. And it’s the high temperature that’s important for working iron, and hopefully, steel”

“Um, what does economical mean?” I asked, trying to make sense of the rest of what he’d said.

Quinn took a moment before responding, “In this case it means reasonable, it’s not possible to get iron out this far for any reasonable price. The city forges have a hard enough time making it, and they haven’t shared the secret with anyone outside their circle so barely anyone else is making it outside of that small group”

“Where did you learn about all of this then, if they’re keeping it a secret? Did you get taught about it by your teachers?”

“Ah,” he hesitated “Well I was taught metallurgy by a man named Tarn Adams. Then I did some more reading on the internet, it’s sort of like a really big library. It’s got books and articles on pretty much anything you want to know”

“Does it take a long time to learn all this?”

“Ah well kindergarten, which is the first sort of school most people go to starts when you’re about 5 years old. Most people my age are just about at the end of their schooling. It usually takes up about 8 months of the year, with the other 4 off for a break. Though sometimes people will use the break to work once they get older.”

He started school when he was 5 years old and has still been in school for all this time? The only time I ever went to a school was to learn maths so I could help Pappa at the tavern without getting cheated. What does he think about me? I can’t even read.

I bowed my head, clutching the basket and trying not to let Quinn see my face turn red with embarrassment.

“Do you think you’ll be able to make steel for Pell?” I asked, trying to move on to something else

“Probably not,” he said, matter-of-factly “I think I can remember everything I need, and how to assemble the furnace but I’m not sure. I doubt I can get any of it from the trader which means that Pell and I probably need to make the pieces by hand, and even then, the sort of furnace I’m familiar with is one that needs to be taken half apart to get the steel ingot back out. It’s not really economical, reasonable rather, for anything other than making weapons. Especially since you can really only make one ingot at a time. I don’t think Pell can really justify the cost, even if it would turn out a fantastic sword who would he sell it too? Who could even afford what its worth? The current plan is for an upgrade to his existing furnace, that I’m pretty sure I can do, and it should still let him work with iron.”

It surprised me. Whenever Quinn talked about anything it always seemed like he knew exactly what to do and how to do it. *Is this what’s had him distracted this past week, trying to figure out how to make steel for Pell? It didn’t seem like it, but I didn’t know what else might be bothering him* “I’m sure you can figure it out,” I said, trying to reassure him.

He smiled a little, “You’re probably right, it’s not like I don’t have the time to figure it out.”

-----

Sila continued to walk along beside me as we got into the town, which was really only about a dozen houses and some other buildings. I had been doing my best not to string her along since I realized what she had in mind. But did that even apply? Where the hell was I going to go? I had some ‘Lord Kalvan of Otherwhen’ like visions of total world domination though the liberal application of gunpowder, but it wasn’t really realistic. Calvin and I had both been injured when we first arrived in ‘Otherwhen’, but Calvin had been nursed to health in a castle. He’d been taken in by a Lord who was more than willing to provide the resources, funds, and manpower to back his inventions. I’d woken up in a village that lived mostly on subsistence farming and exported only some surplus foodstuffs. Calvin’s Otherwhen had even already gotten started with gunpowder and firearm production. All Calvin needed to do was tighten up the formula used and introduce rifled barrels. Instead I’d need to figure out where the hell to find sulphur, and try to make the tools I’d need to manufacture muskets or rifles to the proper tolerances.

It wasn’t as if Sila wasn’t pretty enough, I kept getting lost in her big brown eyes when I was talking to her. I’d been doing my best not to be obvious about it, though she’d probably noticed. While her education was somewhat lacking due to the environment she’d grown up in she wasn’t stupid. That’s one mistake people tend to make about historical civilizations. The average medieval peasant was no less intelligent than the average Canadian software developer, the only difference was the educational material and technology available. Sure, ask the peasant to solve an algebraic equation and he won’t give you anything close to an answer, but try teaching the peasant algebra? Well it’s very likely that he’d learn at a similar rate to a modern human in his age group.

Just like I’d needed to come to grips with the fact that I was indeed in some other world where Tim Horton’s and the internet didn’t exist, I needed to come to grips with the fact that there was a very good chance that the rest of my life was going to be spent in this valley. If that life was spent with Sila, maybe it wouldn’t be so bad, but I couldn’t quite shake the desire for more.

-----

We made our way to Harp’s tavern, the merchant had pulled up out front and he seemed to be wrapping up most of his business. There weren’t a whole lot of people in the town, and they didn’t have a whole lot of money to spend so the little gnome gotten through the crowd already. And oh yes, he was a gnome. There was no mistaking him for either a human or an elf, for starters he was only three feet tall. He seemed to be the first creature I’d met that kept his hair short, and he was the first one with any facial hair though that too was trimmed. His skin was an odd shade of brown. Don’t get me wrong, it’s not like I’ve never seen a brown guy before, I lived in Toronto, it’s about as multicultural as a city gets. This guy however didn’t match any of the dozens of skin tones I’d seen on the streets of Toronto, instead he was the same reddish brown colour as the clay soil around Prince Edward Island.

“Ah, it’s a pleasure to meet you,” said the gnome, extending a small hand. I had expected a tiny and high pitched voice, but instead his voice was more or less the same as anyone else I had met. He did speak very quickly, but his pronunciation was clear and I could understand what he was saying without too much trouble.

I shook the offered hand “Oh careful you, don’t carry me away,” said the gnome in his rapid fire voice.

He managed to get a smile out of me, despite me moping around about the possibility of spending the rest of my life as a smith. “I don’t suppose you’ve got a stack of bricks and some mortar somewhere in there,” I said, indicating the pair of wagons he had, each pulled by two horses.

“You know, no one has ever asked me for house building materials before,” he replied, not quite sure what to make of the question “I’m afraid I’m somewhat light on brick and mortar”

“What about some bellows?”

“I’m afraid not”

“What about springs?” I asked, enjoying the game, Sila starting to giggle beside me.

He frowned and his eyebrows drew together “Ah, possibly?” He showed me some metallic bits and bobs he’d collected, but none looked anywhere close to the size I’d need.

*Hell, I should check the car. I bet I can get most of what I need, masonry aside, from the wreck.*

“I guess it will have to be books then”

“Now books I can do, just over here,” he said, happy to have won the game. “Is there anything in particular?”

*How am I supposed to ask for books about magic, I going to seem like an idiot or a cra-*

“Magic!” provided Sila, “Do you have any books on magic? That is what you wanted, right Quinn?”

*Well there’s that sorted*

“Yes, anything on magic?” I said resignedly, though Sila seemed excited.

“Why I do have a book on magic,” He said, as he reached up and pulled out a book wrapped in brown paper “It even includes a couple spells that the beginner might learn”

*If magic is real,* ***AND I CAN LEARN IT-***

“It’s yours for only 50 drachm” he said, and Sila’s shoulders slumped.

*Nearly a month’s wages, so he’s trying to scam me then. Argghhh, I have to know! If I let this pass me by I’m never going to be able to put it out of my mind. I will forever be thinking about what might have been. I* ***need*** *that book*

“I don’t think you’re going to find anyone here with 50 drachm to give you before you get all the way home, would you consider a trade instead?” I asked.

“Well that depends, what do you have to offer me?” he said, crossing his arms and leaning against the wagon, package held in one hand.

I withdrew my wallet, and took out blue 5$ note, a red 10$ note, a green 20$ note, and a red 50$ note. All were of the new polymer type of bill, with a clear window forming a strip down one side. They were all also in very good shape, and despite the Royal Canadian Mint’s assertions, I still thought that they smelled slightly of maple syrup.

“I will trade for the book, in exchange for any two of these pieces.” I said, hoping that the strange material and artwork would be enough to catch the gnome’s eye. The twenty even has a picture of the queen on it, that’s got to be worth something.

The gnome leaned up inspecting the bills, and I worried for a moment that he’d recognize that what I was trying to sell him was useless plastic. “I’ll give you the book for all four of the notes.”

“Three notes of your choosing,” I countered

“All four notes, anddd… 5 drachm,” came his counter

“Deal,” I said, handing him the collection of ‘artwork’

He handed over the book, still wrapped in paper, and dug around in his coin pouch for the promised money. *Hmm, none of the other books are wrapped up.* I shook the package and heard something bump against the book inside the paper wrapping. He handed over the coins and we said our goodbyes, the gnome apperantly not having anything of interest to Sila.

*I’ve just bought a book that will allegedly teach me magic, for 85$ Canadian. Why do I feel like this makes perfect sense?*

-----

I ducked into the tavern to see if Pell was still here after eating lunch, since he was expecting me back at the forge at some point, and that was the last place I wanted to be right now. He was sitting talking to Harp over a game of Zatrikion at a table near the bar. The game was quickly wrapping up, Pell having learned some closing strategies from me. He looked up as the door opened.

“You got a new book.” he said knowingly.

“Yeah,” I said, grinning.

“Fine, we’re pretty much done at the forge,” he said in a tone of understanding, “I picked up a couple new ones myself”

“Alright, see you for supper then Pell,” I said waiting for Sila. She scurried into the back room to put the basket and dishes away before following me back outside

-----

I had thought better of taking the book up to my room, Sila would undoubtedly be interested and want to follow, and the less time we spent alone in bedrooms the better. *At least for now.*

Instead we made our way back to the Oak tree. As we scaled the hill I looked down at the paper wrapped package in my hand. I noticed that my hand was shaking, and I was leaving indentations on the cover of the book with my fingers.

*Calm, relax. Manage expectations, this probably* ***is*** *a book of fairy tales.* ***But if it isn’t.***

I kept my breathing under control and put the package into the front pocket of my hoodie.

“So, do you think it can really teach magic?” Sila asked, she had been totally quiet the whole way back to the tree. I think she recognized my apprehension.

“I don’t know,” I said, my voice coming out somewhat hoarse.

We walked the rest of the way up to the tree and I sat down against it. Sila took this opportunity to sit down as close to me as possible, any closer and she’d be in my lap. As it was, having her pressing lightly against my side was not unwelcome.

I pulled my folding knife out of the pocket of my jeans and flicked it open.

“Oh my, that’s quite the knife” commented Sila.

I cut the paper on the top of the package, careful not to nick the book. I turned over the package and shook it, and a small round crystal about the size of a pea dropped into my hand. I held it up to the light of the sun. It wasn’t glass, I was sure of that much at least. It was as clear and colourless as any modern glass, but it was much heavier than glass would be and was cut with several facets. *Magic rock?* I slid the book out of the package and put the paper wrapper in the pocket of my jeans. *Always good to have more note taking material.*

“What does it say?” Asked Sila, looking at the cover.

“‘An Introduction to Practical Magic’, by Lili Nidur,” I said “I really hope this is worth it” and I opened the book to the first page.

The first couple pages were an introduction by the author, and didn’t tell me anything that I didn’t already know. The first proper chapter however was titled ‘What makes a Mage’. *This is what I’ve been looking for.* I read on, and discovered something worrisome. According to the book not just anyone could be a Mage, you had to be born a mage. And according to the book only about 1 person in 50 had the ability to use magic and so the potential to be a Mage. *Great, an easy out. ‘It’s not my fault it didn’t work, this book is perfectly genuine, you’re just not a Mage.’* The book went on to explain that magical talent was apparently a quantifiable value determined at birth, and could only be raised through great effort. The distribution was apparently logarithmic. Those with the ability to use magic, but no talent were called ‘wizards’, and they made up 90% of the ‘1’ from the 1 in 50. The remaining 10% were mages, with varying levels of magical talent.

Soo, out of 5000 people, 90 are wizards, 10 are mages, and one of those 10 mages is of the next… level? dan? tier? up from the rest of his fellows. How the hell am I supposed to know if I’m in the lucky 2%?

The book went on to explain that there was a school dedicated to the study and practice of magic in the city of Nimre.

*Magical.* ***School.***

There was a map that appeared to cover the entire continent of Elardia, and it placed Nimre and its school on the western coast of the continent. I could see the mountain range that held the valley I was currently in. It was on the southern coast where it appeared an India-like sub-continent had collided with the larger Elardian tectonic plate, throwing up the mountain range. The mountain range was a rather uncomfortable distance away from the location of the school, about three quarters of the continent and a mountain range stood between myself and the school. But I knew, that there was no force on earth that would keep me from that school if I had even a flicker of magical power. There was no scale on the map, but I guessed that it wasn’t a short trip.

Almost all of the remaining pages were dedicated to five basic spells to get the neophyte Wizard or Mage started. Not the five most basic, but a selection that were supposed to be easy to learn. Ignite, Detect Magic, Light, Apportation, and Seek Water.

The last few pages explained the admittance policy, which appeared rather strict for Wizards, but rather lax for Mages. There was even a stipend for Mages studying at the school, based on their… *fine, ‘level’,* of magical talent. I was worried that I might be too old to enrol, I was 22 after all. I had an image in my head of a bunch of 11 year olds going to Hogwarts for the first time, with one six and a half foot tall giant walking down the Grand Hall to be sorted by the Sorting Hat. Thankfully this was not the case, the Nimre University apparently accepted students of any age. There was one problem however.

“Sila, what’s the current year?” I asked, concerned

“It’s 253, why?” She replied, confused.

“There’s apparently a magical school in Nimre, but they do student intake for people my age every four years. The next intake according to this is mid-spring, 254.”

*I had maybe five months to cross a continent. Less, since if I leave now I’m going to get caught in the mountains in the middle of winter. Three months, three months if I left at the very end of winter, to hit the mountains at the beginning of spring. I don’t even know if that’s smart, early spring is nearly as dangerous as winter in the mountains. And if I’m late to the party, then I’m going to be very late.*

“You said something about the levels, how are we supposed to know if we’re even mages?” she asked, resting her cheek against my shoulder and peering at the book.

*We?*

“That’s what this crystal is for apparently,” I said, holding it up “It’s called a ‘Mage Stone’ and can be used to measure someone’s magical talent”

“Can I try it?” She asked, turning her face up to look at me, her huge brown eyes hopeful.

“Hold on a moment, I still don’t know how it’s supposed to work.”

I read a little further and it explained that the stone would glow with a varying level of brightness depending on the magnitude of the talent being directed at the stone. It spent a few more pages explaining just how to ‘direct your talent’ which amounted essentially to some basic meditation techniques I was already familiar with, and then a ‘push’ on the stone with your Will.

“Why don’t I try this first, I’m already somewhat familiar with meditation and it might take a little while for me to teach you” I said quietly.

Sila seemed surprised at my comment about being familiar with meditation, but she nodded “Okay, do you need me to do anything?”

“Just be quiet, this might take a little while” I said shifting around to get comfortable, Sila nodding silently.

I adjusted the bezel on my watch to note the current position of the minute hand. Then I closed my eyes and focused on my breathing, the deliberate rhythm helping me keep stray thoughts from my mind. Once my mind was well and clear I began to imagine the inside of a watch. With this sort of meditation it was not enough to merely think ‘watch’ and be done with it. It also didn’t need to be a watch either, it could be whatever you wanted, flower, fire, sculpture, anything. But you had to be able to imagine it in every minute detail, you had to see it in your mind’s eye as clearly as if you were looking at it under a magnifying glass. It’s not a sort of meditation that works for anyone and it’s best for people that are visual and practical learners, but it’s very effective if you’re in that category. Visualization also takes quite some time, though this was an image I had used many times before so it was somewhat quicker than it would otherwise be. I was probably over doing it, the book only mentioned the breathing exercise, but I had to do this right the first time. I had no idea how any of this worked, but I had a hypothesis. I had guessed that even if someone was a mage they could block themselves off from their power by failing to succeed the first time they tried to use one of these stones. A failure the first time would colour all the attempts afterwards, and they wouldn’t be able to put the same force behind any subsequent attempt with each failure reinforcing the belief that they didn’t have any power.

Without opening my eyes, I pushed. The book suggested that you call up a strong memory, one that defined your desire for magic. Every want and need you would fulfill with magic, all distilled into a single memory. Instead I used just two words.

***I WILL***

-----

Immediately I could feel heat on my face, like the heat you’d feel lying in the sun, despite my spot in the shade. The heat on my hand was nearly unbearable but there was no way in hell that I was dropping this crystal. I opened my eyes, and the glare was blinding. I could just make out Sila beside me, face turned in to my shoulder to block the light. I closed my hand around the crystal and relaxed my mental hold on it, letting out a breath that I hadn’t realized I was holding. The heat in my hand disappeared, and the light winked out.

Sila looked up at me, rubbing at her eyes “It worked, it worked!” she exclaimed, unable to contain her excitement. She put a hand on the back of my neck and pulled herself up to kiss me. And damn, did she mean it. She pressed herself into me, wrapping both arms tightly around my neck. My right hand found her lower back, and my left cupped her face. We stayed like that for a while before she pulled away slightly. Her eyes were watering, her lips were a little puffy, and she had turned bright red. But she didn’t take her arms from around my neck, instead she put her head against my chest and let out a long sigh. I closed my eyes and bowed my head, nose nuzzling her hair as I pulled her in tighter.

*Oh man, I really needed that.*

A short time later I leaned back against the tree, Sila in my lap, and I adjusted my glasses slightly with one hand. They’d been pushed askew when she kissed me, I took a guilty look around, but didn’t see any potential observers. Most of the townsfolk would be working at this hour anyway, our little secret was safe. I looked down at my watch. 17 minutes. A damned eventful 17 minutes too. We sat there for a while longer with our arms around each other, before she decided that it was her turn.

I took my time and explained meditation to her, using the simplified version that the book recommended. Granted, I had used the more advanced meditation technique to get my results, but I didn’t want to make matters more complicated by trying to teach her how visualization worked. It took practice, and an error in the meditation method might translate to an error in the test. Best then to stick to as simple a meditation method as possible, which is probably why the book recommended the one that it did.

I finished my explanations and Sila slipped out of my lap and sat cross legged on the ground in front of me, crystal cupped in her hands. I could see her relaxing into it, head drooping, and her breaths became deeper and less frequent. She sat like that for nearly an hour, before I saw her steel herself, and **push.**

I could see her relaxing into it, head drooping, and her breaths became deeper and less frequent. She sat like that for nearly an hour, before I saw her steel herself, and **push.**

-----

Nothing. There wasn’t a flicker of light from the stone.

*Oh.*

Sila opened her eyes and looked at the stone, frowning. She met my eyes and froze. I think she saw something she didn’t like in the way that I was looking at her. She put a hand to her mouth and choked back a sob, tears forming in her eyes.

“H-here,” she said, half shoving the tiny crystal into my hands.

She stood up and turned away from me, covering her face with her hands and hunching her shoulders. Finally she couldn’t hold it back any longer, and she started sobbing as she ran off down the hill. I sat there quietly, watching her go.

*Good job Quinn. ‘No force on earth would keep me from that school’, not mountains or rivers, not bandits or soldiers, and not Sila. I was right, I am a selfish bastard.*

I let out a long breath, and looked down at the crystal in my hand.

*Well, I guess I got what I wanted didn’t I.*

I waited a while, sitting under the big oak tree. I didn’t really want to walk back into the tavern and face Sila or Harp right now. Hell, for all I knew Harp might think that a marriage between Sila and I was a forgone conclusion. Then he finds out that I’m going to drop Sila like a sack of potatoes and fuck off to Nimre? I’ll be lucky if I still have a bed to sleep in tonight.

*Well I might as well look over the spells I’ve got, and give Harp some time to cool off*

I flipped the book open to the section on spells. There were five collected in the book, Ignite, Detect Magic, Light, Apportation, and Dowsing. Ignite was what it sounded like, a little fire starter spell. At the end of the section on the spell was a table. It showed the amount of mana *Mana? Cool.* required to ignite various types of wood. It took one mana to ignite tinder, two for kindling, three for softwood, and four for hardwood.

*What the heck is that in Joules, or would it be Watts? How much mana do I have, is it related to the level of magical talent, or is it separate entirely? Even igniting tinder has got to be a decent amount of thermal energy, and is that all coming from me?*

It was somewhat hard to tell, but it seemed like the book had been put together in a rush. Like all the books I’d read so far it was handwritten, *Note to self: moveable type*, but the penmanship in it was far messier than the handwriting in any of Pell’s books. It explained the basics of all the spells, but seemed to skip over answering even the most obvious follow up questions that most people would want to ask. The description of admittance requirements and intake schedule was verbose by comparison.

Detect Magic was also pretty much what it said on the tin. Aside from telling me whether something was magical or not it would also tell me the type of magic, and whether or not it was permanent.

*Type of magic? I wonder if we’re talking a D&D style Evocation/Illusion/Abjuration system of classification, or is this an elemental Fire/Water/Earth/Air system? Another thing not explained.*

The Light spell seemed useful, though it still wasn’t very precise about the units and figures involved. A table like the one from the Ignite spell gave three rather unhelpful references for mana per brightness. One mana for candle equivalent, and two for torch equivalent. Both options would last for one minute.

*So 1 mana buys me 1 candela, but 2 mana buys me, what, 50 candela?*

The next paragraph explained how I could change the colour of the light. It went on to mention that coloured light in general and red light specifically wouldn’t interfere with dark-adaption, and recommended using coloured light when traveling at night.

*I wonder how the spell defines colour. Am I limited to the visual spectrum, or can I make an X-Ray ‘coloured’ light? Don’t know how useful that would be, but maybe I can find a use in something else from the electromagnetic spectrum. Assuming I can even create ‘lights’ that aren’t just visual light*

Finally I could also change the light’s shape. I could have an omni-directional light, or a beam. The book went on to describe how a narrower beam would use less energy than a wider beam, and a wide beam would use less energy than an omni-directional light.

*Does this spell have a cap on how much energy can be put into it? Because if there isn’t one I could narrow down the beam to one degree and dump a whole lot of energy in. That would definitely make an X-Ray light useful, pretty sure getting shot with an X-Ray laser would suck.*

The next spell was Apportation which was just a fancy way of saying Telekinesis. One unit of mana would let me lift 10lbs and move it around for a full minute. Two units would let me do 20lbs for one minute, or 10lbs for two minutes. Three units was 30lbs or three minutes, and so on.

*Ten pounds for one minute, for one mana. That meant that one mana bought me **at least** 60 seconds at 1g of acceleration against a 10lb weight, since at the very least the spell needs to counteract the pull of gravity. Uhh… F=MA, 10lbs is about 4.5kgs, and at 9.8m/s that’s…*

I pulled out the wrapper I’d saved from the package and scribbled the relevant equations on it. *I’m going to need a lot more paper if I’m really doing this mage thing*

*So 44.1 Newtons per second for sixty seconds, or 2646 Newtons per second for one second. That doesn’t even count any energy used to move the object from side to side. Doesn’t that mean I could get a 1kg object up to 2646m/s? To hell with lasers, magic-railgun is where it’s at.*

This gave me reason to pause, one mana was 44.1 Newtons per minute? But it was also either 1 or 25 candela for one minute? It shouldn’t be either 1 or 25 candela, what it should be is 44.1 Watts. I couldn’t remember how the conversion from candela to Watts might go, but I was pretty sure that I should be getting something like 50 to 250 candela per Watt.

*Maybe it’s a matter of efficiency? But you’d think that making a light would be a hell of a lot more efficient than trying to move something around.*

The last spell was Dowsing, which would give me a distance and heading to the nearest significant source of water.

“A human is what, 60% water? I wonder if I could finagle this into a tracking spell?”

I flipped back through the spells, trying to decide which one to start on first. I had no idea how long it would take to learn each one, but I wanted something immediately useful. That basically meant Light, or Apportation. Light seemed really useful, but the D-Cells in the Mag-Lite could last a long damn time. I went for Apportation.

“Use the force Quinn”

-----

By the time I got back to town the sun had started to go down and it was starting to get rather chilly. There were only a few leaves on the ground, it was still early Autumn, and they were blown around by the cool breeze.

It had taken some time to sort out how the book was trying to teach the spell. There were arcane symbols on the first several pages, and the book explained a few memorization exercises that you were meant to follow. I wasn’t sure how it was supposed to teach me how to cast the spell, but something about the symbols seemed to almost tickle my brain. I had the same feeling I’d get when a name was on the tip of my tongue. There were also gestures and incantations to go along with the spell, but the book didn’t just give me one set of gestures, and one set of incantations. There were multiple sets of diagrams, each one more complicated than the last. The gestures could be done one or two handed, and with our without either a wand or a staff.

*If this is anything like Harry Potter and 90% of people need wands to use magic then I need to learn wandless magic ASAP. I don’t want to carry around a big sign saying ‘Hey everybody, I’m a mage!’ and I also don’t want my power to be jeopardized if I accidentally lose a freaking stick.*

There were also some dance steps that the book said would help first timers and novices cast the spell if they were having difficulty.

There weren’t quite as many different combinations when it came to the incantations, really the only difference was the length and whether the incantation was sung or simply spoken.

*At least there’s no material costs, I’d go through bat guano by the ton*

-----

I steeled myself for the coming confrontation, and pushed open the door. It was rather busy, all the regulars were here, along with some people who had come in from their farms or other villages. They’d be staying at the tavern tonight to enjoy the feast day festivities tomorrow. I could see Harp sitting at a table with Moss, Pell, and some of the other people in town that played Zatrikion. He looked up when the little bell over the door rang.

*Here we go*

“Quinn!” He said loud enough to carry over the noise of the busy tavern, and spread his hands in an exasperated manner “How could you have done this?”

*Ah shit, I guess we’re having this out in front of everyone*

I walked over, and sat in the only empty chair remaining at the table. Moss was leaning back in his chair with a self-satisfied smile on his face some reason. *Has he been holding something against me and I didn’t notice?*

“What’s this Scholar’s Mate nonsense Moss is giggling about?” said Harp.

*What.*

“What?” I asked, really very confused.

“Moss bet me ten, **ten**, drachm that he could beat me at Zatrikion. The only one who ever bets against me is Pell, then Moss up and beats me in four moves!” he said with what I realized was feigned anger. The rest of the table seemed to find this pretty funny, with Moss especially pleased.

“Well, will you take my money now?” I asked, risking a smile.

“Fine,” said Harp, throwing his hands up “I’ve never had anyone fight so hard to *give* me money.”

*Maybe he’s waiting to have it out until after everyone’s gone to bed, but then you’d think that there’d be a little resentment there. It just seems like he’s joking around like always*

“That reminds me,” Said Pell, “I owe you for all the help around the forge, and Moss had been gracious enough to pay your wages so far”

“Oh, and how did that happen?” I asked with amusement, as Pell pushed across a small pouch.

“Well once he got done with me, he had the bright idea to try the little trick you taught him against Pell” Harp explained

“Maybe, but I still beat you,” Moss said, still grinning

“Well I might as well teach you all how it’s done so you don’t lose to it again, just let me get something to eat,” I motioned over one of the servers, both of them seemed to be daughters of some of the families in town. Though Sila was conspicuous by her absence.

“Alright, let me reset the board” said Harp, and he rearranged things while my food was brought over.

I explained the Scholar’s Mate to the table, which seemed to earn me some esteem from the little Zatrikion club. Most of the Zatrikion players were older village folk which meant they had some pull within the village. I’d been expecting some suspicion or xenophobia when I came here, but everyone seemed rather friendly. I wasn’t sure if that’s how they always were with visitors or if Pell and the other players had put in a good word, but so far I seemed to be accepted.

*You’d think that they’d be suspicious of a guy that claimed to be from another world*

I also showed them a few ways to counter the scholar’s mate, and went on to ask them about games that people in the village might play.

*If I am making the trip to Nimre I’m going to need money, and I’d much rather gamble for it than work for it if I need to get more along the way.*

Not only was gambling going to slow me down a lot less, but I also just generally didn’t like hard work. I could do it if I had to, I’d been helping Pell at the forge after all, I just didn’t like it. If 2 drachm a day was an average wage for a days work, then I certainly could make more than that in a night of gambling or Zatrikion. Especially since every night would be a new tavern with fresh marks, not yet out of gambling money. It just depended on the game. Purely chance based games are no good, I needed something like blackjack where I could get a net increase with the right strategy. On the other hand, if it’s something like Baccarat then I’ll need to stick to Zatrikion for earning money.

*Unless I can get Apportation working without needing words or gestures…*

They were apparently a couple of different card and dice games that people would play, but there were two that were particularly popular. There was a sort of card-based Yahtzee, and a dice game that basically amounted to ‘roll three dice, highest wins’. This actually worked out rather well for me, the skill based game used cards, and the chance based one used dice. Apportation would help much more if I was trying to fudge some die rolls, and even if I couldn’t get it working I knew a couple of ways to fiddle with dice. Hell, dice here probably aren’t that precise. I probably wouldn’t even need to fiddle with the dice to get them to favour one result over another. All I’d need to do is find some that preferred high rolls. If I made enough rolls in a night the law of averages would get me my profit most of the time.

We talked for a while more, and they ran me through the basics of Not-Zee and Moss showed me the set of dice he used for games. *Oh yeah, not precise at all, they’re hardly even cubes.* Eventually the conversation turned to the wreck of my car, still sitting belly up in the stream.

“I don’t even know how we’d move it,” said one of the other’s whose name I hadn’t learned “Even if we did move it, where would we put it?”

“Well we can probably take it apart,” I replied “Though it being smashed up will probably make that difficult. Nearly all of it can be useful in some way, even if it’s just as raw material. Did you have a chance to take a look at that piece of aluminum you cut off of it Pell?”

“Yeah it’s like tin, except lighter and softer and it melts more easily. I’m just not sure what I’d do with it.” Pell said.

“Where is it mined anyways?” asked one of the men at the table.

“Well native aluminum clusters do appear naturally, they’re just extremely rare. Rarer even than gold or platinum,” I explained, and this seemed to get the attention of the people at the table.

“You have a carriage that’s made of something more valuable than **gold?**” Moss asked, stunned.

“No, well… maybe? Most aluminum mines where I’m from actually mine bauxite ore. It’s then processed into raw aluminum and then they make carriages or drinking containers out of it. Bauxite can be found in large quantities, and aluminum is very simple to recycle. Reforge it as much as you like and it’s still just as good the thousandth time. Both those things make it very inexpensive, I don’t know off the top of my head but I think it’s the least expensive metal you can buy. At least where I’m from.”

“How do you process the ore?” Asked Pell, thoughtful.

“Again, I don’t know off the top of my head but I’m fairly sure that it’s mostly a matter of heat. Aluminum has a low melting point, but to get it from the bauxite takes way more, way more even than what it takes to make steel”

“So it is valuable then,” said Moss “since no one else can get any.”

“Well,” I hedged “That assumes anyone wants it. Pell and I will probably need to trade outside the valley to make any money off of it,” I looked to Pell “I guess we could try making some jewelry or trinkets? We’d probably need to find someone that already knows what aluminum is if we want to sell it to them.”

“I have some tools for fine detail work, why don’t we go take a look day after tomorrow.” Pell said, sitting back in his chair, taking a sip from his mug.

“Say, this’ll be the first feast day that’s been hosted here since you arrived Quinn,” Harp said, changing the subject. “You could show us all the dances from your homeland.”

*Oh fuck, oh fuck fuck fuck.*

“Uh, well we don’t really have this sort of thing in Canada.”

*The one downside to not getting thrown out on my ass, they still expect me to show up and dance, sing, play music, or whatever it is they do at these things. Maybe I can get into another car crash between now and then?*

“Well I’m sure Sila will be able to show you around, it’s great fun for everyone. Do you play any music? I’m sure we could find an instrument for you somewhere in town”

*So he’s not spoken to Sila then*

“I’m afraid not,” I said, with feigned disappointment.

Through sheer force of will I managed to get the conversation into less dangerous territory and we sat and chatted for a while. I stuck around and helped Pell clean up, I wanted to give him a chance to talk to me privately if I’d misjudged the situation, but he just said goodnight and went off to bed.

-----

I brushed my teeth with a willow twig, and washed up with cold water. I hadn’t had a proper shower or bath since the crash but I still washed every day. The others seemed to think this was somewhat excessive but I was used to a different standard of hygiene. At least the others didn’t smell too much. I heated up some water to shave with, and looked down at my folding knife. I had read somewhere that you could extend the life of a razor just by running it along the leg of your jeans. Something about it brushing away imperfections? I had no idea how that was supposed to help, but I’d been doing it with the folding knife and it was still sharp enough to shave with. I’m not really a beard guy so I try to shave as often as possible.

I was just putting out the lantern on my table when I heard a creak from the hall. There was a light tap on the door and I pulled it open. There was Sila standing there in her nightgown, her huge brown eyes a little red from crying.

*I am such an asshole.*

“Hi Sila,” I said quietly, stepping back from the door.

She stepped inside, and looked around a little awkwardly before sitting down in the chair by my desk.

“I’m sorry Sila, I should have been more careful”

“More careful? You mean that you should have been more careful letting me think for a even second that you’d be satisfied to stay here with me, instead of going to Nimre?” Sila said, keeping her voice quiet but obviously very upset.

*Yeah, exactly that*

“I’m sorry, it was selfish of me. I’m sorry I hurt you so badly”

“Can’t it be enough? In the spring when the traders start coming through we could send for some books on magic, I heard what you said about the aluminum, we could afford it” she pleaded with me.

“Sila,” I sighed, she wasn’t wrong “How long does an elf live for? And how old are you and your father?”

“Elves live for three or four hundred years, I’m sixteen and Pappa is almost 160, why does it matter?”

*Sixteen, good fucking job Quinn*

“In Canada the average life expectancy for men is 86. And that’s with all sorts of medical advances to lengthen a person’s lifespan. Here it’s probably going to be more like 65. I’m 22. I’m already a third of the way though my life Sila. I’m also not going to age nearly as gracefully as your father has. If he was human I’d think that he was in his thirties. 40 years from now you’ll still be young and beautiful and I’ll be an old man, another ten years after that and I’ll be dead and buried.”

Sila choked out a sob, “What? That’s not fair, I-” she buried her face in her hands

*Made her cry. Again.*

“Like I said Sila, I’m sorry.” My stomach wrenched watching her cry like that, knowing that this whole thing was entirely my fault.

She took a little time and calmed down. She wiped her eyes on the sleeve of her nightgown and looked up at me.

“Sorry,” I whispered, at a loss for words.

“What am I supposed to do Quinn? Anthior is going to be here tomorrow and he’s going to try to put his stupid hands on me again.”

“Wait, what? Who’s Anthior?”

“Auntie Crisa had been taking me to see him on feast days, she’s been trying to set us up together. Except I hate Anthior, he’s cruel and greasy and he tries to grab me whenever he gets the chance. He’s also the only other man in the whole valley that isn’t either too old or already promised to someone else.”

“And that’s why Auntie expects you to marry him,” I said, finally understanding “I wouldn’t want to spend a couple centuries with someone like that either.”

“Yes,” she said quietly, “Couldn’t you just… pretend? At least when we’re hosting feast days?”

“Sila,” I sighed *This is a terrible idea* “Isn’t that going to cause you some trouble once I leave? I’ll be going on my way come early spring. You and Anthior will still be here, and you’ll be left without an alternative. I’m not saying you should marry him, if he’s an asshole then he’s an asshole, but what will you do instead? People might get ideas if we seem close, and then I suddenly leave.”

 “A-ass-” she covered her mouth in shock but I could hear her giggle a little in the dark room “I don’t know Quinn, but I know that whatever I do I’m not going to be doing it with Anthior. Maybe we just stick together tomorrow, that should keep Anthior off of me.”

*I’ve fucked up most of this, but I can try to at least make it a bit better*

“I’m guessing that Elves don’t have children that often?” I asked, trying to put together a workable solution.

She turned a little pink “Well there’s only about one or two babies born all year in the whole valley. That’s why Auntie seems to think that its Anthior or nothing.”

“Hmmm, where’s the closest nearby city?” I asked, the plan forming.

“Colos is supposed to be a couple days south of the valley, it’s supposed to have nearly ten thousand people,” said Sila in a voice that suggested that she thought that ten thousand was a lot of people “but how would I ever find a husband there? I’m just a silly village girl, what kind of dowry could Harp offer to a man from the city?”

*Dowry, right. I’ll add feminism to my list of things this world needs*

“Don’t sell yourself short Sila, I lived in a city quite a lot larger and you still caught my eye.,” I reassured her, and she smiled a little sadly, “As for the dowry, well you could say that Harp deserves some… salvage, yeah, salvage rights on my Subaru.”

“Salvage? Subaru?”

“Salvage is a maritime term. Basically it means that Harp is owed a share of my vessel’s total value since he helped me, and Subaru is just the name of the company that built my carriage. Assuming Pell and I can get some people interested in our aluminum goods, we’re going to need to sell it somewhere. I don’t think we’d do much business if everyone was trying to get to the village, we’ll need to set up shop in Colos. We will need some people to help with the shop, people that Pell will know he can trust,” I said, looking at her pointedly

“Me? I wouldn’t even know what to do, and I’d have to leave Pappa and the tavern. I don’t know Quinn…” she trailed off, seeming unsure

“You’ll do fine, you’d do the same thing you do here for Harp. You already know your numbers and you’re polite and honest, just keep being you. There’s another benefit, if we can get this aluminum thing working then the shop is going to draw a lot of customers, and not just from within Colos. I bet people will travel just to see some of the rarest jewellery money can buy. And who will be the first person they see when they walk in? You won’t have to settle for the first man with a heartbeat, you’ll be able to pick for yourself.”

“You know, I did already pick for myself,” she said, in a whisper.

“I’m sorry Sila,” I said, letting out a long breath.

She came and sat down next to me on the bed, leaning against me.

“Thank you Quinn, for helping me figure this out I mean,”

I put my arm around her and we sat there for a while, before she got up and went to bed.

-----

I lay there, staring up at the ceiling unable to sleep. My back was aching, and I couldn’t stop thinking about Sila. I felt like the world’s biggest asshole. I had worked out a path to victory, and had tried to patch things up and salvage her feelings, but I still felt like a bastard. A better man would have taken her suggestion, sell the aluminum, buy the books. A better man would have waited the four years until the next time the school was taking more students, and brought Sila with him. A better man wouldn’t have cast around for something to convince her we weren’t compatible. A better man wouldn’t bribe her to go away so he could start learning magic a bit sooner.

*Yup, I’m an irredeemable son of a bitch. But at least I’ll be a mage.*

I lit the lantern with the striker on my Zippo and opened up ‘An Introduction to Practical Magic’ to the section on Apportation. I continued reading where I’d left off, memorizing the symbols it detailed. The book contained a couple different memorization exercises, though from what I understood I didn’t need to use these specific exercises to memorize the spell. It was the actual memorization that mattered, not the process of memorization. This meant I could draw upon some more advanced techniques than what was detailed in the book, just like I’d done with the meditation. No real person is going to be able to assemble a Sherlock style ‘memory palace’, but the concept had some foundation in reality. Learn how to design clever mnemonics and you could get pretty far without needing to hallucinate words hovering in the air. Some people had better memory than others, mine is probably pretty far to the right on the bell curve, but anyone could learn to augment their memory with a surprisingly small amount of practice.

In practical terms, this meant that by about midnight I was satisfied enough with my memorization of the symbols to try casting the spell. I didn’t have a wand or a staff *oh I’ll show you* **my** *staff* so I opted for the two handed gestures, with about a one sentence incantation. *I’m going to need to memorize the gestures and incantations too.* I sat up in bed and shook a loonie out of my wallet and onto the bed in front of me. *Moment of truth.* I made the gestures and whispered the incantation.

It rose off the bed and into the air.

*Well, there it is. I was expecting some incredible epiphany, but I feel kinda underwhelmed.*

I could direct it pretty much as I wanted. I could rotate or move it in three dimensions, and it seemed fairly precise. I experimented with moving the coin around. Imagining the spell as an invisible hand or pair of hands seemed to work well, and I could be about as precise as I could if I was trying to move something with my actual hands. I tried giving some more specific ‘instructions’ to the spell, but it didn’t really seem like the spell was built for it. I tried to move the coin a specific number of millimetres or rotate it by a specific number of degrees but in both cases the coin’s response was to not move at all.

*Oh well, let’s see what I can do if I wanted to mess around with some dice.*

I knew I couldn’t fake a naturally tumbling die roll. Imagine trying to move around a die with your hands to make it look like it was rolled naturally, not going to happen. Instead I wanted to see if I could just tap something with the spell, rather than grab hold of it. I ‘let go’ of the coin with Apportation and picked it up with my hands. I shook it around like it was a die and then cast it onto the bed. As it spun in the air I reached out and tapped it with Apportation. The coin responded exactly like I thought it would, though the effect was somewhat unnatural looking.

*This will take some practice if I want to cheat at dice and not get caught, but this is definitely a start. Assuming I can do it without waving both hands around and speaking arcane gibberish*

I was getting somewhat tired, but I only had a few more things to try. I recast the spell multiple times, each time I did it I’d go one step less complex with either the incantations or gestures. By the time I finally went to sleep I’d found that I could get away with only the bare minimum. I could do it either wordlessly with a few finger movements or without gestures and only a couple of words which I could whisper under my breath.

Satisfied and finally tired enough to get to sleep I dozed off.

# Chapter 5

I slept in the following morning, having stayed up quite late learning and experimenting with Apportation. According to my watch it was 10am by the time I got down to the common room, Sila had seemingly spent the morning serving breakfast and she seemed in a better mood than I had left her the night before. She brought over the same breakfast I always ordered, pancakes with peanut butter and fresh fruit on the side. I would have preferred maple syrup to peanut butter but as far as I knew no one cultivated maple trees to make syrup.

During my first week in the village Pell’s wife, Phelio, had asked me what sort of breakfast food Canadians ate. She seemed to think I was a little homesick, which maybe I was. I explained pancakes and maple syrup to her, the most Canadian of breakfast food. Unfortunately she hadn’t known what maple syrup was but pancakes were pretty easy to make, they were mostly just flour, milk, and eggs. Since then pancakes had apparently become fairly popular for breakfast at the tavern. She had asked me if I’d like anything else to go along with them, and I was tempted to ask for sausages or bacon but stopped myself. I knew that they had eggs, milk, and butter which were all animal products, but in the time I’d been there I’d never seen or smelled any meat being cooked or eaten. They did have plenty of fresh fruit though, so I asked for some of that.

*Maple syrup! It’s going on the list.*

Sila took a seat next to me, the only other table of people already having been brought their food. She wore a different dress today, normally it was a faded and well-worn linen dress in light blue or light green. This one was in much better condition, the hem was still a little ragged, but it was a perfect sky blue and had little yellow flowers on it. It was probably the nicest dress she owned.

“Fair warning Sila, I’m a terrible dancer. I can’t vouch for the safety of your toes,” I said seriously.

This got a little smile out of her “That’s okay, I’ve never been very good either. We don’t need to dance if you don’t want to. I thought you might like to go see what some of the people from the other villages have brought to trade since you’ve been through all the books in town already.”

“That’s not a bad idea, though I do still want to take a look at the couple of books Pell picked up from the gnome trader that came through.”

We chatted for a while as I at my food, and I was just finishing up as I heard the bell over the front door ring behind me. I could see Sila’s face grow much more serious as she looked past me at who came in.

*Foolish Quinn, no proper hero sits with his back to a door*

I twisted around in my chair to see that four boys about Sila’s age or a little older had come in. Anthior and three minions?

“Anthior is the doughy one,” I heard Sila whisper behind me.

The description fit rather well. Of the four he was the palest and most plump, the other three having the same sort of fitness I’d seen from the other boys old enough to start working the fields. They were lightly tanned, and while they weren’t muscular they were all rather trim. Even Anthior wasn’t that unfit, compared to most Comp Sci students at U of T he was about average, but when compared to people that worked for a living the slight chunkiness was obvious. This was compounded by his weak jaw, roundish face, and bowl cut. Most elves I’d seen were all sharp lines and elegant curves. Anthior’s face was just curves, and there wasn’t anything elegant about it. He was dressed in a shirt and trousers like the other three. His were nicer though and they didn’t have the same long worn and faded look that the other boys’ clothes had. I also noticed that he had a small dagger in a sheath on his belt, though his friends were unarmed.

The other three had hair like the rest of the men I’d seen, long but pulled back into a tail. Two of the three were probably brothers, and all were somewhat unremarkable. Blonde hair, brown eyes, lightly tanned and with the normal sharp look I’d been used to with elves. Anthior was probably the youngest at 16 or so, the older brother was maybe 18 or 19.

“Sila,” barked Anthior in a voice too loud for the cosy room “Go get us some breakfast, barley bread, figs, and eggs”

“Phelio’s already gone out to enjoy the feast day, I’m sure you can get some food from one of the tents,” said Sila in a quiet voice.

*I suppose it is a feast day after all, feasting is probably involved in some way.*

“How’d he get his breakfast then?” He said, jabbing his finger at me.

“I made it for him,” said Sila, confidence growing.

*That was rather nice of her, I didn’t know Phelio had already left.*

“You’re Quinn aren’t you,” he said, his ire directed at me now.

*Oh here we go.*

“You’d better stay away from her, you know she’s already promised to me don’t you?” he said in cocky voice.

“THAT’S NOT TRUE!” shouted Sila, “You’re an ugly greasy pig and I hate you.”

*Ah shit*

I heard one of the people sitting at another table get up and say something meant to defuse the situation. I didn’t quite hear what was said, and apparently neither did Anthior. He rushed towards Sila who was mostly behind me. I stood up, hands spread apart.

“Now just a moment,” I said in a reasonable tone.

Anthior did halt his charge when I first stood, suddenly discovering that I was most of a foot and a half taller than him, but I think he didn’t want to seem weak in front of his friends. He reached up and grabbed me by the front of my shirt.

Now I am by no means a skilled fighter, and I’m not that muscular either. To stay fit I tend to do a lot of cardio, biking, running, walking, that sort of thing. It does mean I cut a pretty good figure when my shirt’s off, but that’s more a matter of having 1% body fat and less about being super buff. I have some advantages though, foremost of which is my pretty incredible reach. I’m a tall guy compared to normal humans, and compared to elves the difference is immense. My other advantage was the same as always, better access to information and teachers. I never spent a whole lot of time learning how to fight, but like most things I’d made sure to learn a few tricks. It’s surprising how much of an advantage it is just to know how to throw a punch properly. Most school fights you’ll see two people swing at each other a whole lot, and at the end they’ll only be scuffed up, maybe one ends up with a bloody nose. But if you knew how to punch, using not just your arm but your legs and hips as well you had a massive advantage. Against someone who knew what they were doing I was boned. But against someone who didn’t, which accounted for 90% of the people that would go and start a fight like this, I was fairly confident.

Anthior’s other hand swung way back, as if he was trying to get something out of his back pocket, and I’m sure he thought it made him look cool in front of his friends. With my left hand I grabbed the hand holding the front of my shirt. As he brought his hand back to nail me in the face I jabbed forwards hard with my other hand against the shoulder he was punching with, and I leaned my head back. Instead of hitting me in the face he just brushed against my right shoulder, all the while I hadn’t let go of his other hand. I stepped forwards and jabbed him in the face with my right, no big telegraphing wave to the people behind me, just a short quick jab to the face. He tried to get away, but I still had his other hand and my much greater reach meant that he was out of luck. I jabbed him a couple more times in the face as I saw his friends come to the realization that they should probably be helping.

I let go of Anthior and he stumbled back onto his ass, hands to his bloodly nose. The three rushed forwards, middle one slowed down trying to get around Anthior. Whether I knew how to throw a punch or not, three on one were not odds that I liked. I knew what to do though, even if it was only academically. The solution was to reduce the number of opponents as quickly as possible, choose one and hit him as hard and as fast as possible before someone grabs you from behind. I took a step towards the one on the left, briefly cut off from his pals by Anthior who was in the way of the other two. I swung with all the strength I had, legs, hips, back, and arms. I briefly considered going for the throat but I didn’t want to kill anyone by accident so I settled on the face again. He put his hands up, but too slowly. His attention had been split, he was paying nearly as much attention to me as he was to his two friends to make sure they were charging along with him. I drove him right in the face and he went right down beside Anthior, a lot more blood coming from his nose than Anthior’s.

*Broken nose, whoops.*

That left me with two, which was a somewhat more manageable fight if you could position yourself well. I stepped to the left of the boy I’d just taken down, putting him between myself and the other two. This also left the boy who’d previously been on the far right directly behind middle guy. Middle guy got tripped up trying to step over his downed friend. *I think I just thrashed his younger brother, I think he might be mad at me.* He took a swing at me but didn’t quite have his feet planted and there was no power behind it. I took the hit on my left shoulder and grabbed his arm with my left. With my other hand I repeated the Anti-Anthior strategy and hit him repeatedly in the face until he stumbled on his younger brother who was still on the ground. The last minion had seen what had happened to his friends and adopted a different strategy. He made sure to step around everyone on the ground and then charged at me, trying to grab me with both hands.

Now this was actually fairly clever, I’m decent at striking if I’m fighting someone as equally unskilled as myself. I’m much worse in a grapple though, longer arms meaning I can’t properly apply my strength. I didn’t know any clever manoeuvres for a grapple either. I got pushed back into one of the wooden pillars that held up the ceiling, and while the strikes I was taking were rather ineffectual, they were all to the gut which was really not a good place to get hit after having eaten half a dozen pancakes not minutes before. I finally managed to push him off me and to the right, causing him to stumble backwards into a table, when saw Anthior out of the corner of my eye. Too late, Anthior had already pulled out his dagger and he slashed me across my left side. I felt the pain and sickening heat of the wound, and I might have let out a very unmanly yelp of pain. Getting a knife in the ribs tends to break up the whole 'clinical chess master shtick'. Getting stabbed was a new experience for me, and I looked up at Anthior in shock.

Anthior froze, and he looked almost as stunned as I was.

Finally one of the men I’d seen at the other table grabbed Anthior from behind and shook him.

“ANTHIOR ATOS POLEPHO,” thundered the man, “WHAT HAS POSSESED YOU TO DRAW A BLADE AGAINST THIS MAN?”

*Ah, this would be the Baron*

I pressed a hand to my side, trying to staunch the bleeding. I bit back a pained gasp, trying to focus.

“Sila is promised to me, and this man,” Anthior half shouted, half whined while stabbing a finger at me accusingly, “is making a whore out of her!”

Sila started to say something loud and mostly incoherent, she was mad as hell, but I cut her off. “**Enough!** You’re Baron Polepho I take it? I’m willing to call things even, knife wounds included, if your son apologizes to Sila and agrees to stay away from her in the future,” it took an effort to keep my voice from cracking, and hopefully I managed to disguise the fact that I was barely keeping it together.

The other boys were picking themselves up from the ground and the rest of the Baron’s posse tended to them and sat them down at one of the tables. The Baron hauled Anthior around behind him, tearing the knife from his hand and speaking quietly but forcefully. Sila ran to the bar to get a rag, and I pressed it to my side. The cut started at the bottom of my left pectoral, and curved down, ending on my back just above my left hip bone.

“I-I… What do I do?” she stammered.

“It’s alright, go get someone,” I told her as calmly as possible, and she nodded and ran out the front door.

The Baron finished the angry whispers to his son and pushed him forwards.

“Mister Quinn, I am very sorry for my behaviour just now. I beg your forgiveness and promise not to bother Sila anymore,” said Anthior, head down but eyes angry.

*Lamest ‘sorry-I-stabbed-you’ apology ever*

“I accept your apology, now if someone could grab some of the whiskey Harp keeps behind the bar and a pot of water I’d really appreciate it,” I got a funny look from the Baron and his men, but one of them went to do as I’d asked while I took a seat next to the fire. The things were brought over and I set the pot of water over the fire and waited for it to boil.

It didn’t take long for Sila to return with Phelio, but by the time she was laying out her medieval first aid kit on a nearby table, the rag was mostly soaked through with blood. Phelio took out a curved needle and some thread, and turned towards me.

“Hold on,” I said, “Put the needle and the thread into the pot, and wash your hands first”

“Now Quinn, if you think for a second-” she started to say indignantly.

*Add germ theory to the list Quinn*

I cut her off “Just do it!” I said, probably too loudly.

She was a little taken aback, but she did as I said. The needle and thread went in the pot which had started to boil, and she washed her hands. I don’t think she was really following proper decontamination procedure but it was better than nothing. Sila washed her hands as well, intent to help, and they both came back over. Phelio fished the needle and thread out of the pot with a spoon that I’d left in for that purpose and moved to pull the rag away. Sila stood by waiting to help, eyes wide with worry.

“Just a moment,” I said, grabbing the bottle of whiskey from where it sat on the table.

The whiskey wasn’t quite as strong as I would have liked, but it probably had a high enough alcohol content to do the trick. I pulled the rag away and it adhered slightly to my skin, sticky with blood, but the cut had mostly stopped bleeding. I ripped the cork out of the bottle with my teeth and poured out the whiskey over the wound. I inhaled sharply as the alcohol ran down my side. One I was satisfied I nodded to Phelio, not trusting myself to speak. Sila pressed the wound together and Phelio set to work stitching it up as I did my best to be stoic and manly about the whole process. It was all well and good to have an academic knowledge of what to do in a situation like this, but no book or website really did a good job of explaining just how much it hurt. I set the bottle on the mantle as they worked, leaving a bloody handprint on the label. With Sila’s help Phelio was thankfully pretty quick about getting the wound closed, and I could finally breathe without it coming out as a gasp.

I took a look at my hands, finally noticing the pain in my right hand. Both palms were bloody, but the knuckles on my right hand were cut up and I was pretty sure I had a fracture in that hand. I’d probably cut them on someone’s teeth. That was the one downside to going for the face. People think that boxers and MMA fighters wear the gloves to protect their opponents. In fact they’re there to protect the hands from the sorts of fractures and cuts I’d manage to collect in the short fight.

I relaxed back into the chair, and looked up to see Harp, Pell, and some others from the town looking at me sitting by the fire. They all seemed pretty surprised. I was sitting there shirtless and bloody with a long line of stiches down my side. Sila was standing there seemingly in shock, her hands were bloody and she’d also gotten some on the front of her feast day dress and on her face where she’s evidently brushed her hair aside with her hand. Phelio was somewhat more collected but had also gotten blood on her hands and dress. We all looked at each other for a silent moment before I broke the silence.

“So,” I said blithely, trying not to let the pain creep into my voice, “How much do I owe you for the whiskey?”

“For the love of,” Harp started, taken aback, “Quinn, what happened here?”

“Well I think you should ask Baron Polepho about that,” I said, nodding to the Baron who Harp hadn’t noticed when he’d first come in.

I couldn’t tell if Baron Polepho was glad or irritated that I’d left the responsibility of explaining the situation to the gathering crowd inside the tavern, but I figured that I’d rather know the Baron’s position ahead of time before giving my own account of events.

“My son felt slighted by your daughter, and stepped forwards to chastise her,” the Baron began to explain.

*Chastise, oh is that what he was going to do?*

“Quinn interceded between the two of them and my son attempted to strike Quinn. Quinn, my son, and his friends fought. At the end my son drew a knife and slashed Quinn across the side while he was contending with one of the others,” he explained, loudly enough to be heard by all those that had pushed into the tavern, “I had gotten up from my breakfast by this point and managed to restrain my son.”

*I guess he doesn’t want to go into detail about how badly I kicked their asses.*

Harp looked over at me questioningly. I nodded, “That’s how it happened, the Baron and I have also already come to an agreement settling the situation.”

The Baron nodded, and I could see something in the way he was looking at me. *Kinda disappointing actually. I was expecting a ferocious outburst not a reasonable, if face saving, response.*

“If you wish to discuss this further Mister Harp, might I suggest some privacy?” said the Baron, tilting his head towards the crowd clustered around the door.

Harp shooed the people out of the tavern and looked over at Sila, concern clear in his eyes.

“It’s my blood not hers, we’ll be fine,” I said, nodding towards the Baron.

Harp went over to speak to the Baron while the Baron’s men tended to the injuries I’d inflicted on the four boys. Sila had boiled another rag, *she picked up on that quickly,* and helped me clean up. She was very gentle, careful around the gash and with my damaged hand. I got her to splash a little of the whiskey over the knuckles on the one hand and Phelio wrapped it up. Phelio also wrapped a bandage around my chest, covering the gash in my side. The two women helped each other clean up before Sila went off to change out of her bloodied dress.

The Baron approached the two of us, and Phelio retreated. Harp had apparently finished his conversation with the Baron and gone to check on his daughter. I looked him in the eye, and waited for him to speak. I like to think I looked pretty good sitting there. Despite the daylight the windows in the tavern were small, and so it was rather dim. I was stripped to the waist, wearing only blue jeans, and I was lit by the flickering light of the fire next to me. He was quiet, and it seemed like he was waiting for me to say something. I didn’t oblige him and eventually he spoke.

“I appreciate your assistance in resolving this incident quickly.”

“Neither of us stands to gain anything by drawing it out, and I’m satisfied as long as Anthior keeps to the agreement.”

“I take it then that you’ve decided to marry the girl yourself?”

“Nope,” I said, matter-of-factly, “I’m leaving for Nimre as soon as the mountains are clear enough to travel through.”

The Baron blinked. “Oh, and why would you do that?” he said slowly “Nimre is quite some distance from here.”

“Why does anyone travel long distances to Nimre,” I asked, raising my eyebrows.

“Is that so?” He said, thinking, “Why the fight then? Why insist that Anthior stay away if you don’t want her, and then why bargain away your one piece of leverage to no profit for yourself?”

“The fight? That was because I wasn’t about to allow Anthior to strike Sila, whether I want her or not some things just aren’t done. As for Anthior staying away from Sila, it’s not a question of whether I want her or not, it’s whether Sila wants Anthior or not. She’s made it clear to me that she’s not interested in him.”

“Interested or not, sometimes people must compromise their individual desires in favour of their duty to their family. Sila’s aunt Crisa has certain expectations of her, and Misses Crisa has made certain promises to us.”

“I’ve been told before that I can be a rather uncompromising person. Crisa should have considered whether Sila would be inclined to cooperate before making any promises. Has Harp made you any such promises? I’ve seen him around the village plenty, I’ve yet to meet Sila’s aunt.

“Perhaps these matters are handled differently where you come from, but here it is traditional for the mother to have the marriages of her daughters arranged by the time the daughters reach marrying age. With the death of Sila’s mother that responsibility falls to Sila’s aunt. This was something arranged nearly two years ago to be conducted once they both came of age. My son’s sixteenth birthday was several months ago, and only Sila’s lack of cooperation has postponed the marriage. I had hoped that the date of the marriage could be announced today, to be carried out next time I host a feast day.”

“You are quite right, they are handled differently. For me it is a straightforward matter, Sila does not want to marry Anthior, therefore she doesn’t have to marry Anthior.”

“That is rather a simplistic view of things, while such a viewpoint might seem sensible to a common man such as yourself,” he said ‘common man’ as if it was a slight against me, “I must take a rather more complex view of matters, I will go to some lengths to ensure that my family is provided for. That includes providing a suitable bride,”

*Oh, I think he’s threatening me,* I stood. The Baron was not easily intimidated, but despite his lack of obvious reaction I hoped that I made some impression.

“There are what, twelve houses in town? Four other villages, let’s say 12 houses in each of them as well. Maybe some have a little more, or a little less, but on average let’s call it 12. That gives us 60 houses in the villages of the valley. Say, 2 adults per house, that’s 120 people spread between the villages. There’s the farms too to consider, it’s just a guess, but I’d put your urbanization rate at about 20%. That means another 480 persons living in the countryside of the valley on farms. So all told, there are probably about 600 people in the whole valley, am I right?” I asked, still speaking quietly enough not to be heard by anyone else.

The Baron hesitated, and I could see from his expression that I’d gotten fairly close, “Your point?”

“My point is that in the city I’m from, Toronto, there are individual buildings that hold more people than this valley. I respect you Baron Polepho, but I do not fear you. You asked about leverage? There is one other thing I’ll need aside from Anthior’s continued non-interference with Sila.”

“And that is?” he asked calmly, though the situation was getting a little tense.

“A map, or collection of maps, so I can plan my route to Nimre.”

He raised an eyebrow, “And after you’ve left…?” he asked, trailing off.

“No, you can’t possibly be suggesting that you might not hold up the deal once I’d left, say it isn’t so,” I said with feigned shock, “Baron Polepho, by the time I leave either Sila will have a suitable alternative, or you can go ahead and try to strong-arm her into the marriage. Is that an acceptable compromise?”

The Baron didn’t seem sure what to make of this, “You are aware that there are no alternatives in the village, or even the whole valley?”

“If you find the deal unacceptable then we can reach an alternative arrangement,” I said, as graciously as possible.

“If that’s the deal you want to make, then I’ll have some suitable maps delivered here. Now excuse me, I must see to my son.”

The baron went off to check on his son, and I went upstairs to get my other shirt, having ruined the one I’d had on when I got slashed. At least I hadn’t been wearing my hoodie at the time, I only had one of those and I’d need it for the journey to Nimre. As I was walking back upstairs I heard some shouting in Sila’s room, and saw Harp come back down the stairs with a warning expression. Despite this warning, I was thinking of taking a look in before I’d realized that I was still not wearing a shirt.

*Probably not the best idea to step into her room with whoever she was arguing with while half naked.*

I got my spare shirt, now my only shirt, out of the dresser and pulled it over my head. I could still hear shouting, it sounded like just one voice, and it wasn’t Sila’s. The door to her room was open a crack, and I pushed it the rest of the way open and stepped inside. I could see Sila sitting on her bed, bloody dress clutched to her chest, wearing only a linen shift. She had her head bowed and seemed to be doing her best to endure the verbal abuse. The small older woman that had been shouting, *Auntie Crisa I presume?* stopped suddenly at the sound of the door opening, and she opened her mouth to say something indignant about men barging into ladies rooms while they were changing.

“You’re Sila’s Aunt Crisa?” I asked, pointing at her rudely.

“Yes,” she said angrily. She was about to continue her tirade but I cut her off.

“Get out.” I said calmly, jabbing a thumb over my shoulder.

“What? You Barge-“

“Get out!” I said, loudly enough to startle her. “Out!”

She left in a huff, chin up, trying to do her best to look down her nose at me. She did not succeed, the one and a half foot difference in height made it rather difficult. I let out a long breath, and looked over at Sila.

“What was she going on about?” I asked, bleary eyed and tired, as I leaned against the doorframe.

The adrenaline rush had worn off, I hadn’t gotten a whole lot of sleep last night despite sleeping in, and it’s surprising how tired even a short fight will make you.

“I told her that I wasn’t going to marry Anthior, no matter what. She didn’t like that.”

“Well, she’ll just have to deal with it. And I’m sorry ruining your dress,” I said, nodding at the dress still clutched to her chest.

“Don’t be silly it’s not your fault, and I can get the blood out of it. I just can’t believe what Anthior did, and you! That was amazing, I’ve never seen anything like what you did,” she said, standing up and touching my side gently, “Even after Anthior slashed you, you were so calm. I was mostly useless, all I could do was run off and get Phelio. Are you gonna be alright? That was such a nasty wound, what if it gets infected?”

It looked like she was trying to decide whether or not to wrap her arms around me. *That’s over and done with Quinn.*

“I’ll be fine Sila, that’s what the business about the whiskey and the boiling water was about. Cleaning the wound site and the needle and thread like that should prevent any infection. I’ll just need to keep it clean and I’ll be fine. Besides,” I said, “it worked out in the end. Sure I got cut up, but now you’ve got a promise from Anthior to leave you alone and I’ll have the maps I need to plan my trip.”

*And it gives me a very good excuse to get out of dancing.*

“Trip, right,” she said sadly, her arm dropping away from my side.

“Why don’t you put something on before your father comes up here to find me in his daughter’s room while she’s changing?” I said, trying to avoid a repeat of the incident under the oak tree.

“Alright,” she said, stepping back, “I, um-”

“I’ll be in my room,” I said reassuringly.

-----

I flopped back on the bed, and stared up at the ceiling. *Hey, maybe if I milk this I can get out of the more menial work with Pell. Now there’s an idea.* I rolled over and looked at ‘An Introduction to Practical Magic’ which was sitting on one of the side tables. It was just out of reach, and I really didn’t want to start moving around again. *Well I can do this whole magic thing.* I cast Apportation with a whispered word and pulled the book into my hand. I also pulled out my notepad and pen from where I kept them in my pocket.

*I’m going to need some things for my trip to Nimre, and before that I need to get my affairs in order here in Essens*

First is what can be done with the car, that’s step 1. The body is pretty much entirely Aluminum, which if we spin this right will be very valuable. I’ll need to get Pell started with working the stuff before I leave. The battery could be useful for electroplating if it’s still intact. I guess I could try to charge my phone off of it, but the voltages would be all wrong. If it’s not intact then I guess it still is about 5lbs of lead and whatever acid didn’t leak out. Alternator too could be useful for power generation if it still works. Rubber on the tires could be useful, nearest source of natural rubber is going to be the jungle, which could be very far away from here. We could also strip the tread off the tires ‘Dies the Fire’ style and use it for making the soles of shoes. The rims are all alloys, *what the hell sort of alloy?* which might be useful, unless they have too high a melting point to work with. The space saver in the trunk though uses a steel rim I think? Again, melting point becomes the issue. Frame of the car might also be steel, the car is old enough for the frame to be separate I think. Springs and shocks could be useful, assuming they’re not bent up from the crash and multiple rolls. Seats are full of that weird orangey-beige foam stuff. I bet that could make a very warm blanket. The upholstery could be used for clothes I guess? Same can be said for the floor carpeting, or we can just use it for actual carpeting. There’s also the registration and user manual in the glove box, I guess that’s some more paper for my notes. Though it’s all been written on already, maybe I can figure something out for that. Snow brush in the trunk, maybe Pell can do something with it. There’s going to be about a mile of copper wire running through the car, maybe even some bits of gold in the computer. The copper wire will be useful if I want to play with electricity, and the gold has obvious value without needing to explain what the hell aluminum is to anyone.

I looked up from my note taking, I could hear Sila and Harp talking in her room.

Step two is figure out what the hell I’ll need to cross a mountain range and most of a continent. Well the first thing I’d need is a proper accounting of the distances involved. I still had no idea what kind of pace I needed to set. Aside from that I need, water, food, shelter, and proper clothing for the weather I’ll be facing. Money as well, since it can get me most of those things. For money I could bring some aluminum, and save up the wages Pell is giving me. It’s not like there’s a whole lot to spend it on anyway, and aluminum is light. I also need to get the hang of Not-Zee and refine my dice cheating technique. I guess I’ll also need dice. Actually, I bet I could make myself some aluminum dice. That would give me something else to sell if I needed to. On the topic of aluminum, I should get the mage stone set into a ring, an aluminum ring would be pretty easy to make.

I pulled out the mage stone, I hadn’t actually tried to light it up since the first time I’d used it. I’d been keeping it in my wallet’s coin pouch until now. I tried clearing my mind and pushing my Will into it again, skipping any sort of meditation this time. I wanted to see how much work it actually took to light it up. It was fairly easy, and the stone lit as soon as I put any weight behind my though to make it light up. I didn’t get the unbearable heat or blinding light, but it was probably a bit brighter than a candle. *I guess once the mage switch is flipped it stays flipped.* I could feel a slight exertion as I left the light lit. It was a very odd sensation, it wasn’t a physical exertion, it felt more like I was concentrating on answering a math problem. I put it away, adding ‘aluminum mage ring’ to my list.

Water, food, and shelter are going to depend a lot on whether or not I can just pay for everything. If this place is anything like medieval Europe then there should be a town every 8 to 12 hours of walking distance. That is some distance apart, but it’s also close enough that a traveler isn’t spending most nights in a tent. I can fill my canteen with quite a lot of water, I didn’t even go through all of it on my hike. Food, well I’ve got that MRE which is one proper meal. I could stretch it to last a day if I needed to, it was a three course meal. It would also keep for basically eternity and was in a waterproof package, I’d save it for emergencies. Pemmican should be my normal camping food, it can also keep for a long damn time and actually tastes pretty good. It’s also pretty good for calories per pound. Native Americans knew what they were doing apparently. I will need some meat and animal fat though, and I still don’t know if these elves butcher any of their farm animals. Shelter, well I could make a tarp out of the carpets from the Subaru. They were made of synthetic fibres and were built specifically to be sturdy. Throw that over a branch with one end propped up on a tree and I had an instant tent. I could use a second carpet-tarp for the groundsheet. I could even see about making an aluminum pot to boil water with on the road. It would be light and I’d be able to sell it if I needed to.

Proper clothing was mostly covered already, I had just been on my way back from a hike after all. I had my hiking shoes, they were Gore-Tex and were quite possibly the sturdiest pair of shoes on the entire planet at this point. I picked them up from where I’d kicked them off, using Apportation again to get used to using the spell, and looked them over. They were in very good nick, all the stitching was in good shape, the soles weren’t worn down. They’d last me to Nimre and further if I took good care of them, and they’d keep my feet dry the whole way there. I had the hoodie still, and between it and the coat I might be covered for even winter weather in this part of the world. I’d gotten a sort of Mediterranean vibe from the place, despite being up in the mountains, and assuming I waited out winter the two would probably have me covered for any cold or wet weather. The coat wasn’t Gore-Tex like my shoes, but it had some sort of aqua-phobic coating and would keep the rain off. I was somewhat worried about the hoodie though, it was very soft. I might end up wearing through the elbows if I had it on the whole way to Nimre, but it would keep me warm either way.

Step three was arguably the most important though. I needed a weapon. Beating up four village boys was one thing, but I might run into bandits or other ne'er-do-wells on the road. I might even get myself in trouble if I wasn’t careful at dice or cards. Hell, I didn’t even need to cheat, I might just piss someone off enough by winning enough. I can be an arrogant prick sometimes. It wouldn’t be enough to know how to throw a punch and position myself correctly, if I did run into a bandit they’d know what the hell they were doing, and know better than me. Maybe a gun, but that might go very poorly. I probably could put together a musket or a pistol or two over the winter, but anything I made was going to be a bitch to reload. That assumed it didn’t blow up in my hand, and that I could carry enough powder. *Functionally a musket would be a lot like a crossbow.* Thing was, I knew how to use a crossbow, or even a standard bow. That was more to my liking, and I could make arrows in the field if I really needed to. I might even be able to just buy them if I found a fletcher. A bow was probably the way to do it, since reload time would be a problem with a crossbow.

I’d also need some sort of backup weapon, a bow would work at fairly close range but it was risky. An axe of some sort would probably do the trick. When I had to build a melee fighter for an RPG, I always preferred wizards, I pretty much always picked something with reach. A halberd was my favourite, but any polearm would do. My problem was concealability, I had a sneaking suspicion that a giant with a 6 foot halberd slung on his back might be the object of some suspicion. Local laws might prohibit me from carrying weapons that were meant for military use. An axe though could work quite well, either a hatchet which I might need anyway for chopping wood, or a felling axe. The felling axe would also give me pretty good reach, and the hatchet could sit in my bag if I was somewhere that took issue with even basic weapons. Even with the felling axe, I could get the axe head off and throw it in my bag if I really needed to. It wouldn’t be too hard to make a new haft later down the line.

*I do like to play the Archer after all.*

# Chapter 6

I was still scribbling notes on what I’d need for the trip when I heard a knock at the door.

“Come in,” I said, expecting Sila.

Instead it was Harp who stepped through the door, and he seemed angry about something, “What’s this Sila and the Baron are telling me about you leaving?”

*Ah shit, here we go*

“The Baron said that you two had worked out a deal and as part of it you had to leave? When I asked Sila about it she seemed to know, but told me to ask you,” he continued.

I could see Sila standing shyly in the doorway behind her father.

“Sorry, I just didn’t know what to say,” she said.

“It’s fine Sila, I understand,” I picked up ‘An Introduction to Practical Magic’ from where it sat on the bed and held it in my lap, and looked down at it. “I bought this book from the trader that passed through here yesterday. It details how to find out if someone is able to use magic, and also teaches a few spells. As it turns out, I’m a mage. I’ve even learned one of the spells from the book already. It also tells of a magical school in Nimre, and how you get admitted. I need to leave some time in the spring to make it there for the next admittance period. The one after that is in another four years. The deal wasn’t for me to leave, though the Baron might be framing it that way to save face. The deal is for him to have some maps sent over so I can plan my trip.”

I looked up at Harp, and it seemed like he didn’t know what to believe “Boy, are you sure about this? Magic? You yourself seemed sceptical about it, and now you’re going to travel across the world on the word of a book?”

*Third time he’s called me boy*

I spoke the words to Apportation and lifted the book from my hands, and sent it hovering towards him. “I was sceptical of the book too, even as I bought it. But the results are clear to see. If it was right about magic, it’s a small thing to believe it when it says there’s a school in Nimre dedicated to teaching it. Especially since the Baron seemed to know what I was talking about.”

He brushed at the book with his hand, in a way that suggested he though his hand ought to pass right through it. Instead the book dropped to the ground as soon as he touched it. *Wasn’t expecting that.* He jumped back, looking down at the book.

“And the Baron isn’t forcing you to leave?” he asked, still unsure, anger dying away.

“No, I guess that’s what he’s going to tell people to save face, but I’m leaving of my own accord,” I explained.

“Well, I guess there’s that then,” he said, “I’d thought the Baron had threatened you or something. He’s got no business throwing people out of my town,” he paused, and seemed to gather his thoughts “You’re really doing this? Who else have you told already?”

“Sila was the first to know, I also told the Baron since I wanted the maps from him, and now you know.” I said, “I’d planned to tell Pell today since I’ve been helping him with the forge.”

“Well,” he said, quietly, “We’ll be sad to see you go.” Sila, who was still standing behind him turned her face away when he said this.

*No kidding.*

“I do plan to leave things better than when I started though,” I said, trying to brighten the mood, “I want to get Pell set up to work with iron at the very least, that alone should give Essens a leg up on things. The other thing I want to do is get some aluminum goods made for sale outside the valley. Done right this could bring in a lot of money for the village. Between the two I’ll have hopefully paid my debt to you for helping me.”

“Oh, that was nothing,” he said immediately, picking up the fallen book, “It was just the right thing to do.”

“All the same though, I appreciate it. I’ve got a couple months, and that should be enough to do what I’m planning.”

“Well,” he said, handing me back the book, “I ought to let you rest.”

Harp left, leaving me alone with Sila again. She slipped into the room and sat in the chair at my desk.

“I’m sorry you won’t get the chance to go and dance Quinn, thank you again for protecting me though,” she said quietly, with less of the energy that she’d had when I talked to her in her room.

*I’m not sorry.*

“It’s alright Sila, you can still show me around the rest of the festival if you want. I don’t want to bust open the stitches dancing but I can walk around a bit,” I said, trying to be open minded about this whole ‘festival’ thing.

“No, it’s okay Quinn. Everyone would be looking at us or asking questions. I just want to be left alone right now,” she said.

*I can certainly get behind that sentiment.*

“I hope I didn’t complicate matters for you Sila, if Harp heard it from the Baron I take it that the Baron isn’t being quiet about me leaving?”

“I don’t know, I haven’t been back downstairs since I came up to change. But it seems like something he’d do, just mention it here or there and let it get around. Especially if he could make it seem like you leaving was his idea. It’s not fair, you’re leaving because you want to, not because he’s kicking you out.”

“It’s fine Sila,” I said, sighing, “It would have been very easy for things to get complicated if the Baron forced the issue. As long as he holds to our deal in private he can say whatever he wants in public.”

Sila sighed, wrapping her arms around herself and drawing her knees up to her chest, “I get it, it’s just not fair.”

*Do I ask her for help with testing Apportation? Magic might be a rather sore spot for her.*

“Um, is there anything I can do to help with, that?” she said hesitantly, gesturing vaguely at the book held in my hands.

I looked down at the book, “Sure, I was actually wondering why the book dropped as soon as Harp touched it. I couldn’t just pick it back up again either, I lost the spell entirely once Harp touched the book,”

“Maybe the spell doesn’t work on things held by other people? Here, try sending it over to me and I’ll grab it.”

“Alright,” I said, nodding.

I cast the spell and sent the book on its way over to Sila, and she reached out and grabbed it. Just like with Harp, as soon as she touched the book I lost the spell entirely. I didn’t just lose my grip on the book with my Apportation ‘hands’, the spell as a whole collapsed.

“It happened again that time, I’m going to try to take the book from you, let me know if you feel me tugging on it,” I said. Sila seemed excited, even doing something so mundane as this.

*Well I suppose it is* ***magic*** *I was also pretty thrilled with the concept being real.*

I cast the spell again, trying to take it from Sila. I felt some sort of resistance when I did it, and the spell failed.

“Feel anything?” I asked, I’d definitely felt something.

“No, I guess it didn’t work?” she said, unsure.

“I have an idea, I’ll try that again.”

I cast the spell again, this time putting some Will behind it like I had with the Mage Stone. I felt the same resistance as before, but this time it felt like the spell was pushing through it instead of folding immediately. It took only an instant and I was through, and I could tell that I had the book in my ‘grip’.

“Feel anything?” I asked, not yet exerting any force on the book.

“No, am I doing something wrong Quinn?”

“You’re doing fine Sila, what about now?” I asked, giving the book a tug.

It seemed to startle her and she jumped a little, loosening her grip on the book enough for it to slip free of her hands.

“Oh, it worked! Why wasn’t it working before?” She asked, surprised but also excited.

“I think that if I want to interact with something someone else is holding I actually need to make an effort to get the spell to work. I’ve got a couple more things to try, do you mind?” I asked, already adding more tests to my mental list.

“Sure,” she said, as she got up from the chair and sat down on the bed next to me. *Proceed very carefully Quinn.* “I don’t really want to go out right now anyway. Anthior has other friends and they’ll probably want to impress Anthior by pushing me around or trying to start another fight with you.”

“Sorry about that,” I said, feeling slightly short sighted. Even if Anthior was kept away from Sila, she still had to live here.

“It’s okay, it’s worth it just to keep Anthior away,” she giggled, “And to see the way you beat him and the rest of his little gang.”

“Well, if I run into people like Anthior on the road they’re probably going to be much better armed. I’m trying to figure out if any of the spells in this book,” I said, lifting the book, “can be used to protect myself. That’s why I’m doing the testing.”

She nodded, suddenly serious, and maybe a little concerned, “Okay, what do you want to try next?”

I spent some more time with Sila testing out some theories I had on just how Apportation would work when interacting with another person. Hopefully the ‘rules’ for Apportation would carry over to the other spells in the book. It wasn’t just Apportation I was trying to get a handle on, but magic in general.

The first thing I tried once I knew I could actually effect another person was whether or not someone could ‘harden’ their defences against someone using magic on them. So I got Sila to focus very hard on not letting me take the book, and then I tried the spell again. I still managed to get through her, *Will, I guess?* but it was noticeably more difficult. We repeated that a couple times and it got a little harder each time to take the book. I wasn’t sure if that was me wearing out, or Sila getting better, but I hadn’t felt a drain even after casting the spell so many times. I’d felt the pressure when trying to get through Sila’s will, but not any drain when actually casting the spell. *I hope that I’ve actually got tons of mana, and that I’m not one spell away from dropping dead due to mana-exertion. Maybe I’m recovering my mana as fast as I spend it? I do a hell of a lot of cardio after all, my endurance and recuperation time are pretty good when it comes to physical tasks. Maybe that carries over to magic? But that doesn’t seem very in-theme to me.* I was fairly sure that the effects I was seeing were due to Sila actually putting up additional defences on top of the apperantly passive defence that anyone had, so I moved on.

The second test was basically the opposite of the first, I wanted to see if Sila could let me take the book. It looked like she could, I had her focus on letting me have the book, and I didn’t feel any resistance when trying to take it from her.

I’d wanted to test my magic-railgun idea but that didn’t really seem feasible today. The fair was on, people were everywhere and it would be hard to find a quiet spot outside. And if it did work I might end up drawing attention if it did work and the projectile went supersonic. So instead I came up with an alternative that could be tested safely indoors. Rather than throw something at an attacker, I’d pick up the attacker. Sila couldn’t be more than 100lbs, and was probably more like 90lbs. That came to 9 or 10 mana. Granted, I had no clue how much mana I had, but I figured I’d give it a shot.

It didn’t work. At all.

I tried again, using both hands to gesture and speaking the longer incantation. I think I frightened Sila a little with the display, but nothing happened. I didn’t feel any resistance from Sila, actually I didn’t feel anything at all. When I usually cast the spell I could feel something like a little ‘pop’, and I could tell that I had the spell active. When I lost a spell I could also feel a little ‘pop’ and I’d know that something had ended the spell. It was a hard feeling to describe, it was almost like a barely noticeable hum in a quiet room. You’d notice it when it first turned on, but you’d become accustomed to it quickly and it would fade into the background. Then you’d notice it again when it disappeared, the sudden silence very different from what you’d been hearing a moment ago. But when I tried to lift Sila I didn’t get anything, no ‘noise’, no resistance, nothing. It just didn’t work.

*So I guess I’ve got between 1 and 9 mana.*

“Is something wrong Quinn?” asked Sila, still a little unnerved by my big swoopy hand motions and then the extended silence as I consulted my notes.

“I’m trying to get an idea of how much mana I have, that’s what the book calls a Mage’s magic reserve,” I explained, “I apparently don’t have enough to lift you up, the spell just isn’t working.”

“Well, I’m not a Mage,” she trailed off, unsure. I nodded, encouraging her to continue, “Well couldn’t you try to only lift me up a little bit? Like only use a little bit of mana and see what happens?”

*That’s a good idea.*

“That’s a good idea,” I said, “let me know if you feel anything.”

I gave it another attempt, this time using only as much power into it as I put into lifting the book. *Where to put my hands? The hand Quinn, the hand.*

“Oh!” Sila exclaimed, holding up her left hand, “I felt that, are you able to pick me up now?”

“I’ll try, let me know if it hurts and I’ll stop right away.”

“Okay,” she said, nodding. She seemed a bit more relaxed now that I wasn’t chanting and making weird hand gestures.

I slowly increased the upward pressure until I hit the upper limit of what the spell could do, and I could see Sila being pulled up and to the side as her hand lifted up. She didn’t seem to be trying to fight it either physically, or with her Will.

“Sila, can you try to pull your arm back down?”

“Okay,” she said, this time clearly exerting herself, “It’s hard, like I’m pushing down on an overstuffed chest.”

I could feel the pressure against the spell, and while it didn’t fail she was able to get her hand back down. *Even if she is only 90 or 100 pounds, 10 pounds of force is not too much trouble when gravity is on your side.* I let go of the spell, and definitely felt the ‘pop’ as it ended.

“Anything else?” she asked, still seeming eager to help with my magical research.

I did have some more ideas, though they mainly focused around trying to get some idea of my mana capacity. I didn’t really want to keep manhandling Sila to do that.

“I think we’re fine for now,” I said, stretching and letting out a large yawn, “I do have some ideas more tests, but those will need to be done outside. Do you know if Pell left any of the new books downstairs?”

“I’ll go check,” she said, hopping up, “You stay here, you need your rest.”

I raised my hands in defeat, she scurried out of the room and I could hear her pitter-patter down the stairs. She came up a while later with one of the books.

“Here, I don’t recognize the cover, this is a new one right?” She asked, still unsure.

“’Enmelos and the Beetle’,” I read, “Yeah, this is a new one.”

“Um,” she started, unsure, “Would you read it to me?” There was another awkward hesitation, “It’s just there’s not a whole lot to do.”

*Be careful Quinn.*

“Sure,” I said, finding myself a more comfortable position.

It was early afternoon when she finished helping me with my tests, and I read to her until long after we both should have gone to bed.

# Chapter 7

As it turned out I was right about my injury getting me out of work for a couple days. Pell and I had planned to start stripping the car a day or two after the feast day festivities, but Pell had insisted that I rest. It’s always nice when people cooperate with my plans to slack off. This gave me a few more days to experiment with Apportation and to learn the other spells in the book. Sila also had some free time now that the last big feast day before winter was over. There wasn’t going to be any more traffic from outside of the valley, and as winter came closer people traveled between the villages much less frequently. This abundance of free time on her part meant that she’d decided to appoint herself as my assistant and had insisted on helping with my experiments.

I had two tests in mind for today, the first test was to get a specific figure for my mana capacity, and the second was to see if I’d be able to use Apportation to protect myself. *Small stones would work in a pinch, but I bet I could make some lead bullets at Pell’s forge.*

“What are we trying first Quinn?” Sila asked as we were finishing a late breakfast.

The first test was fairly simple, especially since Apportation seemed to have a linear cost progression. All I needed was an accurate estimate of the weight I was trying to lift. Unfortunately Essens was rather short on weight sets and the only scales I knew of were the merchant scales that Harp kept behind the bar. There was plenty of water though, which was nearly as good. Water, conveniently, weighs exactly 1kg per litre. Harp did have a few 1 and 2 gallon jugs, with each gallon being roughly 4.54 litres. Convert 4.54 litres to pounds and you’d get almost exactly 10lbs.

“I want to get an idea of how much mana I have, my plan for that is pretty simple, I’ll just see how much weight I can lift with my telekinesis spell. It takes 1 mana per 10lbs. I know that I’ve got at least 1 mana because I can cast the spell at all, but it can’t be more than 9 or 10 since I wasn’t able to lift you up when I tried. My experiment should tell me where I fall in that range,” I explained.

“Oh, and how much do you think I weigh?” she asked, in a tone that made me realize that I’d just ventured into very dangerous territory.

“Nint- Eighty five pounds?” I said, hesitantly.

“I guess that’s fair,” she said with a small self-satisfied smile, “what are you going to try instead? We buy things for the tavern by weight, but it’s never really very precise. Sacks of potatoes maybe?”

“Water, 1 gallon of water weighs almost exactly 10lbs. I count the number of gallons I can lift and that’s my total mana reserve. I just need to go down to the pump to fill up some of Harp’s jugs.”

“Oh, I can do that,” she said hopping up.

“Now hold on a second,” I said, my natural inclination towards chivalry overruling my desire to avoid work as much as possible.

“You sit down,” she said tersely, “I already fetch water all the time for Pappa, and you’ll break open those stitches.”

I raised my hands in defeat, “Alright, alright, but for now just get the one 2 gallon jug. I’m going to need to rest between attempts anyway, and there’s no point in you exhausting yourself if I only end up needing a couple of jugs.”

“Fine,” she said, seeming pleased with her victory, “I’ll bring it to the back room.”

“Oh I don’t know, are you going to tackle me if I try to get up?” I asked, “It’s an awfully long way to walk, I don’t know if-“

She swatted me on the shoulder and went off to fill the jug.

-----

I had my little spellbook open and was flipping through the symbols for Light when Sila pushed open the back door, carrying the large jug. I stood up to give her a hand, she was breathing heavily and her hair was sticking to her sweaty face.

“You sit down,” she said forcefully, “I can do this Quinn.”

She heaved the jug onto the table next to the one gallon jug I’d snagged from behind the bar, and collapsed into a chair across from me.

“That’s perfect, thanks Sila,” I said, feeling guilty. Whatever Sila might say about the stitches, the jug wouldn’t have been any trouble for me, but it weighed nearly a quarter of what Sila did. I was pretty sure Sila knew that as well. She’d been doing her best to impress me and make herself useful, and I’d been doing my best not to let on that I’d been appreciating her attention.

I hauled the jug across the table to sit in front of me, and glanced up at Sila. She was looking at me with that look again, the same one I’d first seen when I finally got my glasses back, but she cast her eyes down as soon as she saw me notice.

*Dammit Quinn.*

I sat there for a moment, quiet, looking down at the book on the table next to the jug. Without looking up, I motioned Sila over, “Come here Sila,”

I didn’t look up, but I saw her out of the corner of my eye as she walked around the table to stand next to me. I reached out and slipped an arm around her waist, pulling her close. She didn’t need much prompting, she slipped her arms around my neck and rested her chin on my head. We were both quiet for quite a while, me siting, her standing next to me, arms around eachother.

“Thank you Sila.”

“You’re welcome Quinn.”

“I still have to go.”

“I know.”

After a while Sila straightened a little, and seemed to consider returning to her seat. Instead she sat across my lap, resting her head against my shoulder.

“What now?” she asked, nodding towards the jug and the book.

I slipped my arm around her back to steady her, “Well I guess I cast the spell”

I made the gestures with my free hand, and cast the spell to lift up the jug.

Or at least I tried to. It didn’t work.

Sila looked up at me, question clear in her huge brown eyes.

“It didn’t work. I didn’t feel any resistance, I didn’t feel anything at all. It’s the same as when I tried to pick you up. The spell just failed altogether. One moment,” I said, and I cast the spell again, this time to lift the one gallon jug.

This time it worked just fine, I could pick it up and make it float around. I set the jug back down.

“So I can pick up a 1 gallon jug, which is 1 mana. But I can’t pick up at 2 gallon jug, which is 2 mana. Do I only have 1 mana?” I asked, as much to Sila as to myself.

She slipped her arm behind my back, “Could you try casting the spell twice? Combine the spells to pick up the jug?”

“Makes sense, I’ll try again in a bit though. I want to make sure I’ve fully recovered my mana before I try this again. No point in doing this if I end up with the wrong figures at the end.”

“It must come back pretty quickly though, right?” She asked, “We spent lots of time yesterday trying things, and you kept casting it over and over.”

“That’s true,” I said, nuzzling her curly brown hair with my nose, “But something is keeping me from putting any more power into the spell. It seems odd that I’d only have the one mana, there must be something else I’m missing here.”

“I’m sure you’ll get it Quinn.”

We sat quietly for a bit, and then I tried the spell again. This time though I cast the lower powered version of the spell twice, imagining each copy of the spell as a single hand. This did work, and I moved the hands to grab the handle of the jug. As soon as the two ‘hands’ got anywhere close to eachother I felt a disruption, I tried to keep the spells from collapsing but I just couldn’t hold them. I tried again immediately, getting two more copies. *So I can’t cast a spell for two mana, but I can cast four spells for one mana in quick succession?* I gave it another try, keeping the hands on opposite sides of the jug, but as soon as the hands got within a metre of eachother I could feel the disruption. By the time they were within half a metre the disruption was overwhelming and I lost the spell again. I tried a few more times, trying to do a better job of holding the spells, but it just wouldn’t work. I took off my glasses and set them on the table. I rubbed at my eyes with my free hand and leaned back in my chair.

“None of this makes any sense. Either I’m doing something badly wrong, or I’m the magical equivalent of a tiny Asian karate master.”

“Tiny Asian what?” Asked Sila, clearly very confused.

“Ah, well according to the Mage stone I’ve got a lot of talent, we both saw that. I can also memorize one of these spells fairly quickly. But on the other hand I might only have one mana, so magically speaking I’m talented but very weak. Though it looks like the one mana I do have is recovered nearly immediately. I just don’t know, maybe I’m doing something wrong with Apportation.”

She leaned up and gave me a reassuring peck on the cheek, “Well then what about the other spells in the book?”

“Yeah, I’ll need to learn Light. Apportation might be failing due to something about the stuff I’m trying to lift, but Light’s result should be entirely independent. I’ll just need to sit down and study the spell for a few hours.”

“What about the other test in the mean time? You said you wanted to use Apportation to protect yourself, how would that work?” she asked, picking up my glasses from the table.

Sila had been asking more questions recently, asking me to explain what I was doing and how I was doing it. She might have been genuinely interested, but I was pretty sure the main reason for all the questions was that she’d realized how much I enjoyed having someone to explain my ideas to. Especially when that someone was quite pretty and liked to sit in my lap.

“Well Apportation is designed to pick up something weighing 10lbs, and hold it there for sixty seconds. That’s actually quite a lot of energy, my plan is to use that energy in a much shorter time frame to throw something small and dense. Probably lead or steel balls, though stones would do in a pinch.”

She stopped with my glasses halfway to her face, “So like a magic bow then?”

I blinked. *Damn, exactly like that.*

She thwacked me on the chest, “Why do you look so surprised. You’re trying to do the same thing that a bow does, it’s a way to turn strength that’s normally used over a long period, and use it all at once.”

I smiled, catching her hand in mine, “I’m just impressed, you’re pretty clever to make connections like that.”

“You don’t need to say things just to make me feel good Quinn, I know I’m not as smart as someone who’s gone to as much school as you have,” she said, taking her hand away and putting on my glasses.

“Don’t sell yourself short. Education is not the same as intelligence, you might not be educated but don’t think that you’re not intelligent. Ah, Sila, are you alright?”

“Everything is so blurry, I it’s giving me a headache,” she said, squinting and blinking a lot.

I gently took the glasses from her face, and slipped them back on.

“Is that what it’s like for you without them?” She asked, rubbing at her eyes.

“Not quite, but it should give you a rough idea of how bad my vision is.”

I rather liked the look of Sila when she was wearing my glasses.

“Oh!” She exclaimed, hand held to her mouth, concern clear in her voice, “What if they break? There’s no way that anyone in the valley could ever make something like this.”

“Trust me, the thought has occurred to me. Without them I’m mostly blind, and it’s only a matter of time before something happens to them, no matter how careful I am. I’m hoping that I can find something in Nimre to solve the problem. Either some spell to fix the glasses if they break, or hopefully a spell to correct my vision permanently.”

“I’ll miss you Quinn,” she said sadly.

*Foot, meet mouth. Maybe find other ways to bring up your plans to leave at every oppritunity.*

I sighed, “I know.”

I could tell that there was a question she wanted to ask, *Probably something along the lines of ‘will you come back?’*, but she didn’t seem to find the nerve. Instead she got up after a moment.

“Why don’t I put together a picnic for the two of us, we can try the other test out under your tree,” she said, changing the subject.

“Alright, just as long as I have your permission. The tree is awfully fa- Alright, alright!“ I said, laughing and fending off the vicious slaps.

-----

Sila and I walked up the hill towards the old oak tree that I’d apparently been granted ownership of. It had lost many of its leaves, and they were spread across the hilltop. It looked like the tree was ablaze, scattering glowing embers across the hillside. Sila laid down the blanket she’d brought along with the basket, again she’d insisted that she be the one to carry everything, and we sat down. I’d collected a few roundish stones on our walk out of the village, and I spread them out on the blanket before me. Sila set out the lunch she’d prepared for the two of us, and I got to work trying to abuse the limits of Apportation.

I failed miserably.

Sila did her best to cheer me up while I was grappling with the spell. She snuggled up next to me and fed me tasty food, but I just could not get Apportation to throw the stones any faster or further than I could by hand. I stood up, despite Sila’s protests, and tried walking around to see what would happen. From what I could tell Apportation moved the object relative to my body, just as if I was holding it with my hand, but this discovery didn’t really solve my problem. I could wind up for the throw with a bit of a run, just like I could if I was going to throw it by hand. Unfortunately it was also about as effective as doing it by hand. I was not going to scare off crusty old bandits by pitching rocks at them.

I looked over at Sila, who was still sitting on the blanket. She was looking at me like she thought that I’d absolutely lost my mind. In fairness, I probably looked pretty goofy. I was a giant by the standards of anyone in the valley, and I was running back and forth across the hilltop throwing rocks and swearing.

“It’s not working,” I said, as I threw myself down on the blanket and looked up at the sky, “It turns out that this whole magic thing is kinda difficult. I can’t get the stones moving any faster than a strong man could throw them.”

“Oh, I know!” She said excitedly, “You could throw spears or knives, just like Enmelos!”

“Well sure but that’s something I can do already. I’m pretty sure I can throw something nearly as fast by hand as I can with the spell. I might as well just bring along a bow. Throwing knives are all well and good in stories but aren’t very effective in real life, and spears are too heavy to carry more than two or three.”

Sila didn’t say anything, and I twisted around to look at her. She was sitting with her legs pulled up to her chest and her arms wrapped around her knees, eyes downcast.

*Good job Quinn, snap at your only friend on probably the entire planet and make her feel foolish for saying anything.*

“I’m sorry Sila, I didn’t mean it like that. I’m just frustrated, and I shouldn’t be taking it out on you.”

“It’s alright Quinn,” she said, “What about the other spells? Couldn’t you do something with them?”

“I don’t think so. If I’m right I’ve only got the one mana. The only other spell I might be able to use for defence is Ignite, but for 1 mana the only thing I can light is tinder. So I can throw either rocks or matches. Neither is really going to be very effective.”

“Are you sure you’re going to be safe? I know you mentioned bringing the bow, but it’s an awfully long way to travel. I worry about you, what if you run into bandits or slavers on the road?”

“Slavers? Pardon me?” *Because this was too easy already.*

“I heard one of the Baron’s men talking to Moss before, in Adympia they capture travelers and make them work on their farms or in the mines. I think even one or two of the people living in the valley are runaway slaves.”

“And Adympia is the kingdom right over the mountains isn’t it?” *Fantastic.* “What about to the south? Do you think I could find passage on a ship to Nimre? Or at least one to get me past Adympia?”

“I don’t know Quinn, I guess? The capital of Rhona is supposed to be on the sea, I bet they’d have lots of ships.”

“That might be the way to do it then,” I said thoughtfully, “The pass south will clear well before the pass north, and a ship is going to get me there much faster than walking. I might even be able to make it through the pass south now, even with the snow that’s already fallen in the mountains.”

“What?” Sila asked, voice a little higher than normal.

“Don’t worry,” I said quickly “I’m not leaving yet Sila. I’ve still got plans for Pell’s forge, and that will last me into midwinter at least. But if I can find a boat headed to Nimre I’ll have a lot more room for error. I don’t want to arrive in Nimre, only to find out that I’m a few days late and need to wait four more years before I can get in.”

I picked myself up of the ground, and sat back down with my back against the tree.

“Come on, sit down. I’m going to teach myself Light and I require your assistance.”

“Okay, but how am I going to be able to help? I don’t know anything about magic,” she said, as she sat down next to me.

She took a seat next to me and I wrapped and arm around her.

“You task is actually the most important,” I explained seriously, “Your task is to provide moral support so I don’t tear my hair out trying memorize the spell.”

Sila giggled a little, and I set to work learning the spell.

*This isn’t so bad, is it?*

# Chapter 8

The days went by excruciatingly slowly as I waited for the pass south to clear. From what I’d found out from the Baron’s maps and speaking with some of the better traveled folk in the village I might have been waiting until early summer if I’d tried going north. Not only was that about a month after the acceptance deadline in Nimre, it would have also driven me crazy, sitting there in the village bored out of my mind. As it was, waiting for the beginning of spring was bad enough. According to my watch I’d spent nearly 150 days in the village by the time that I left for Nimre, and the last 120 or so had been some of the most boring days of my life. In the first month spent in the village I’d read every book, learnt all the spells, and run every experiment I could think of. I continued to test things with the spells just to entertain myself, but I quickly discovered that the spells were incredibly limited in what they could do. My additional experiments were really only slight variations on what I’d tried before, and they hadn’t taught me anything new.

I spent many days working with Pell in the forge trying to reinvent some of the modern crafting methods I was familiar with. I’d like to think that I did a pretty good job, but it was astounding how much time everything took. I basically knew which ideas would work and what wouldn’t work by the end of the first month, but actually implementing those ideas took ages. I eventually got him working with iron but to do it we’d needed to rebuild the entire forge. *I can see why everyone spends so much time drinking and gambling at the tavern, there’s nothing else to do here. Simple life? To hell with that.*

We’d spent a couple of weeks stripping the car of everything even slightly useful. Every single scrap of aluminum was melted down and made into ingots which were stacked in a shed behind Pell’s forge. We’d tried aluminum pots, but it didn’t really work, they required a lot of careful handling to ensure they didn’t just melt on the fire. We had much more luck with jewellery and trinkets, I even made myself a few sets of aluminum dice. We gave thermite a shot, but we both realized quickly that it wasn’t really feasible. Not only was is a waste of aluminum, but getting enough iron oxide together was a slow and tedious process especially since it wasn’t till midwinter that the forge was ready for making iron. Even if we were willing to spend the time and materials, thermite has such a high ignition point that it wasn’t really possible to light it outside of the forge.

We’d pulled apart the engine, which was in really terrible shape. The battery was cracked and smashed open, Pell salvaged some of the lead, but nearly all of the acid had all leaked out onto the ground. The alternator had fared a similar fate, the wires and coils were recoverable but it wasn’t ever going to work again. I did hit the tree head on at highway speed, so most of the engine was under the front seats and smashed to pieces. We got some use out of the tires by partnering with the Baron’s cobbler, apparently the only proper cobbler in the whole valley. We stripped the treads off the tires and the cobbler used it to sole shoes. They weren’t as nice as what I was wearing, but they were a far sight better than anything else in the valley.

Pell and I tried to melt down the rims, but I had no idea what they were actually made of and we just couldn’t get the forge hot enough. As far as I know they still sit in his shed next to what’s left of the aluminum. Just for fun we made a siege crossbow from the car’s leaf springs. Damn it was powerful, but it wasn’t anything I’d be able to take with me on the road. It took the two of us in turns to load the thing and it weighted nearly as much as Sila. I think Pell ended up selling it to the Baron. Pell was surprised at just how much copper wiring was in the car. There probably **was** about a mile of it all together, which Pell promptly recycled. I had some dreams about power generation, but there wasn’t much I could really do in only a few months. I might have tried charging my phone, but I could just as easily have blown out the thing if I’d given it the wrong voltage or amperage. We also dug the little bits of gold out of the car’s computer, but it was such a tiny amount that it was barely worth the effort.

Some of the women in the village took the seat upholstery off our hands. I found it rather entertaining when I first saw Sila wearing my Subaru’s front seat as a dress, though she seemed a little hurt after I started laughing. I was right about the seat filler as well, I have no idea what the orange foam stuff is but the village got a couple of winter coats out of the deal. With the help of Phelio I made myself a tarp using the carpets from the Subaru. We stripped off the fuzz, just as if we were preparing a hide to be tanned, and we were basically left with a plastic sheet. I experimented with recycling the paper from the car’s manual. I wasn’t terribly impressed with the results, but it did leave me with another notebook.

But even all that work didn’t take very long. When I’d first agreed to help Pell at the forge I was interested in the idea, it was a chance to make use of the knowledge I’d gained wasting time playing Dwarf Fortress and Cataclysm, but I was also dreading the work. It turned out that I need not have bothered, there was barely any work to do once the snows started to fall. There’s only so many horses that need shoeing, and so many pots to mend. Even if the regular work week in the village was six days on, one day off, by winter it was often the opposite. I think the only thing that kept me sane was all the experimentation I was doing with bows. Unlike my magical testing I could always find something new and interesting to try and I’d often go off stomping around the woods, Sila shadowing me, as I looked for appropriate pieces of timber.

I did experiment with decurve bows, purely since I liked the idea of a bow that could be left strung all the time, but I eventually discarded the idea. They were less powerful even than the simplest straight bow, and I had come up with some very clever designs over the winter. It’s amazing what a person can do with the right tools, materials, and about a hundred straight days of mind numbing boredom.

The bow I finally came up with was monstrous, both in power and in appearance. I’d combined the techniques and designs used by half a dozen different cultures, leaving me with the Franken-bow. I’d started building it centre out, since I decided early on that I wanted an arrow shelf. It was more precise and allowed the arrow to pass through the centre line of the bow instead of being slightly offset. I’d also grown used to it from shooting modern compounds bows. From the Mongols *always the exception* I took the reflex design, and from the Native Americans the recurve design. Both were techniques to get more power out of a shorter bow, and it was possible to use both methods in a single design. For the final version of the bow I even made the trip to the north end of the valley to get my hands on both sinew and horn, making my final design a composite bow in the style of medieval China. Horn and sinew weren’t quite as good as fiberglass when it came to energy storage, but they were superior to any wood I might find. A ‘composite reflex recurve shortbow’ is a hell of a mouthful, but this was one hell of a bow. The weakest of the English longbows had at least a 100 pound draw weight, and were still 6 feet tall. I was fairly sure that I’d gotten this bow damn close to 100 pounds, and this was out of a 4ft package. The Franken-bow can probably be described as overkill, but this was also going to be my primary means of self-defence out on the road. I did also pack both a hatchet and a dagger, but those were weapons I had no experience with. A bow on the other hand? That I could use.

It took me some time to work up to the 100 pound draw weight. Before being dropped, literally, into Essens I’d had a 60 pound compound bow. Nearly doubling the strength required was quite a jump, but I’d had plenty of time to work up to it. Early on in the design process I tried my best to replicate the cams and levers of a compound bow with bits from the car, but it simply wasn’t feasible. Thankfully I’d played plenty of Age of Empires, and I knew how important it was to research thumb rings as soon as they became available. Rather than the English two fingered draw I could instead use the thumb ring to basically grab the string in my fist and use all of the strength in my hand to draw the bow. A modern quick release would probably let me use even more strength, but the thumb ring would be a great deal faster on the draw and it was something I could make with the tools available to me.

-----

It was the eve of the spring equinox, and the rain outside fell in sheets. I could hear it beating against the window shutters and crashing against the clay roof tiles. Pell, Sila, Moss, and myself were gathered around the fireplace, wood crackling and popping, preparing for the journey south. We had all of our things spread out on the floor in front of the fire, and were checking over what we’d prepared. The plan was for the four of us to travel together to Colos which was a city, at least by medieval standards, only a couple of days south of the valley. The others would stay in Colos and locate a building to set up shop in. Pell and Harp had some small amount of money stored away, and between the two of them Moss seemed confident that they’d be able to rent the space they’d need. Harp would stay in Essens to man the tavern, and instead Sila would handle her father’s share of the business. Pell would turn the aluminum into jewellery and various trinkets, and Sila would do her best to charm wealthy customers into buying Pell’s goods. Moss would be on hand to make sure that things run smoothly, since he was one of the only people in the village that had really spent any time in Colos.

If I’d set things up properly the village should see a nice influx of funds, which should make life there a little easier. Sila would be out of the Baron’s reach, and would have her pick of the merchant class’s unmarried sons. Harp should even have the money to hire on a proper apprentice to pass on his trade. From Colos, I’d continue on for another couple of days to arrive in Myra where I’d hopefully find a ship headed in the right direction that wasn’t too expensive to afford. I had been saving up though, Pell paid me two drachm a day, and Harp only charged me one. Combine that with my almost **magical** luck at dice and I had about 200 drachm saved up. Hopefully that would be enough to buy me passage if not to Nimre, at least past Adympia.

The floor in front of the fire was covered mostly in my own belongings and aluminum ingots. The others only had to plan for at most 5 days travel, while I might have to be prepared for three months on the road if my plan to hop a ship fell through. Each of them had a spare set of clothes, and enough food for a couple days. The plan was to stop just south of the pass out of the valley at an inn Moss had been to before. From there we’d continue inn-hopping, this meant that they wouldn’t need to carry much in the way of emergency rations since we’d never be more than a few hours from civilization. They each had some miscellanea, wineskins, and Harp had brought a couple of his books. Most of the weight they’d be carrying was the extra aluminum, and some of the trinkets that Harp and I had already made.

I on the other hand, had quite a sizeable inventory. I’d already planned to bring along everything I’d been keeping in my room, though I’d be leaving the jack with Pell once we got to Colos. I also had the Franken-bow, 50 iron tipped broad heads, and about a week’s worth of pemmican. The pemmican I’d prepared when I went to the north end of the valley to get materials for my bow. I also had three sets of three aluminum dice which I could either gamble with or sell. Finally I’d also made myself a rope hammock, and packed the tarp that I’d made from the Subaru’s carpeting. I’d actually given my hammock tent a test on a rainy autumn night, and it worked very well. The tarp kept the rain off, even with the autumn winds blowing the rain nearly sideways, and the hammock kept me clear of the wet ground. It was actually more comfortable than my bed in the tavern, since I’d made the hammock specifically to fit me. The beds in the tavern on the other hand were about a foot short of long enough, and the footboard was an integral part of the frame so I couldn’t remove it to make room. I’d been sleeping with my legs pulled up for months, and the chance to finally stretch out felt amazing. After that first test I actually slept outside most nights that autumn, only returning to my bed in the tavern once it became too cold.

“You really think that’s all you’ll need to get all the way to Nimre? What if you can’t find a ship? It’s quite a ways Quinn and it’s rather harsh country.” Moss said to me.

“Well you said that it’s about 8 hours between towns for a person on foot right?”, and Moss nodded at this, “Well I went over the Baron’s maps, and I’m pretty sure I can cover the same distance in 6 hours.”

“That’s quite the pace to set Quinn, you sure you can do that?” Pell said, seeming concerned and somewhat skeptical.

“When you travel to one of the Baron’s feast days, how does that trip usually go?” I asked, smiling a little.

“Well, usually we’ll leave just after breakfast and we’ll get there an hour or two before dinner. We usually sup on the road, why?” Moss supplied.

“I can get there in time to have lunch, and then be back in time for dinner,” Moss and Pell both seemed surprised at this, “And I’ve been actually doing the trip once or twice a week to keep up my endurance since I knew I’d be making the trek to Nimre.”

Sila was smiling a little, “Sila, did you know Quinn’s been doing this?” Pell asked, noticing her expression.

“Yeah, he’s been bringing the Baron some of the bows he’s been making. But why bother running yourself so hard Quinn? You always seem to want to take your time with everything, you’ll still end up sleeping in the inn overnight when you get there. Why exhaust yourself?”

I opened my mouth to speak, and then hesitated, “Are you casting aspersions on my work ethic?”

“I’m not casting anything Quinn, you’re the Mage. But you do seem kinda lazy sometimes.”

“Now I’m not agreeing with her Quinn-“ Began Pell, big stupid grin on his face.

“I helped rebuild your entire forge!” I said, a little indignantly.

“Well sure, but that doesn’t count-“

“Doesn’t count?”

“That was one of your **projects**,” and he emphasized the word, “Like making the bow. When it’s one of your projects you do nothing but eat, sleep, and work. But if it’s not one of your projects, well, you’re very leisurely.”

I raised my hands in surrender, “Fine, you win. But I’m not planning to stop to sleep at the first inn I reach every night. If I did, I wouldn’t be able to make it. It would take about 160 days at that rate, not including days lost to bad weather or other issues that might crop up on the road. I’ve got precisely 110 days starting tomorrow morning when we leave, not nearly enough. So instead I’ll stop for lunch and rest for an hour, then continue on to the next village,” Sila and the others raised their eyebrows, seeming surprised, “I’ll get there in the middle of dinner, an hour or two after the sun’s gone down. I’ll spend the day resting on feast days. Should only take me about 95 days that way, and I’ll have two weeks’ worth of room for error.”

“By the-- do you really think you can keep that pace?” Moss asked, “I’ve been through a lot of the land you’re planning on crossing Quinn, I had a hard enough time covering the distance I did in 8 hours. You want to do twice that in only 12?”

“Well the average elf can do, what, four miles an hour? From what I can tell most villages are near enough 30 miles apart, and you could cover 32 miles in eight hours so that makes sense. The average human on the other hand can do at least five, and soldiers in a forced march are expected to do six or seven. I can keep up forced march speed, so potentially I could even do 30 miles in five hours. Spending another five or six to get another 30 miles further on is not that far of a stretch.”

“But you’re going to do that for nearly a hundred days!” Sila said, and I wasn’t sure if she was worried or impressed.

“I’m not saying it’s going to be fun, in fact it’s going to be damn hard, but it’s doable. Though, I am **really** hoping that I do find a ship, even if it only gets me part of the way it’s going to make my life much easier.”

“I don’t know if there’s gonna be any passenger ships heading to Nimre, but you might find a mail carrier or cargo ship. If you can, try to find a ship owned by one of the big merchant families, they’ll usually be flying the family crest on a banner from the top of the mainmast. Most of their captains are paid by the milion, not on shares. They’ll welcome the chance to make some money on the side,” explained Moss.

I’d been picking his brain over the past several months as I’d been planning my trip. He was much better traveled than I’d first thought, and I’d been starting to think that he might have once been in the military. It wasn’t that he stood straight as a board and marched around giving orders, because he didn’t. Instead he had the sort of quiet confidence of a man that was comfortable in his own body.

Moss and I checked over all of our gear, and finally the four of us had a chance to eat dinner, and go to bed.

-----

I’d already put myself to bed and was just drifting off to sleep when I heard the door to my room open. It was absolutely pitch black. There was not a single light on in the whole of the tiny village, and the heavy cloud cover and rain blocked out any light from the moon or stars. I could hear them slip into the room, bare feet on the lightly creaking floorboards. I heard them shut the door, making very little sound, and they stepped towards the bed. I felt the mattress move slightly as they laid a small hand on it, feeling their way along. They were breathing quickly and shallowly, clearly very nervous. If not for the sound of the rain still beating against the roof and shutters I thought that I might have heard their heart hammering away. I could feel the mattress sink down, as they eased their weight onto it. I felt Sila’s small form as she laid a hand on my chest and pulled herself on top of me. I felt her lean down and touch the side of my face with a soft hand, kissing me. I raised a hand to her waist, and felt bare skin.

*Oh. I think I’m skipping a couple of bases here.*

I’d been doing my best over the winter to keep things from getting too heated between the two of us and she hadn’t kissed me, **really** kissed me, since that first time under the Oak tree. Since then she might plop herself down in my lap when the two of us were alone, but that was as far as it ever got. We both knew that we’d be separated for some indefinitely long period of time, but we were also rather alone and we enjoyed taking comfort in having someone close. I was one of the only people near her age in the whole valley, the lengthy elf generational cycle meaning that there were very few children born at the same time. And I’d been separated from everyone and everything I’d ever known, excepting the contents of one wrecked car.

The last time I’d found myself in a situation like this, things had not gone well. It had been clumsy, unsatisfying, short, and a frustratingly long time ago. The lack of internet access had added to my frustration, and I was having a hard time thinking of reasons not to just throw her lithe form down on the bed and relieve a little stress.

“mmmmphhh,” I tried to speak, though Sila was making that rather difficult.

I felt her pull the rough linen covers down to my waist, and she slipped her hands up under my shirt. I could feel her delicate nails dragging along my skin. I brought one of my hands up to her face, and pushed her gently away, giving me a chance to breath and allowing me to speak.

“Sila,” I said warningly.

“Shut up. Just shut up,” she said forcefully, and I could hear her voice quaver with both need and frustration.

She slapped my hand away, and dug her fingers into my hair, angling my head back. She kissed me hard, and with her other hand she grabbed me rather firmly between the legs.

*Alright, decision made, this is a terrible idea.*

I got my hands around both of her wrists, and I wrestled her off of me. She was careful not to make any noise to wake the few other people in the tavern, but she wriggled around and fought me until I pinned her to the bed beside me. I spoke the words to cast Light, and a cold white light illuminated the scene. I could see her huge brown eyes as they reflected the light, and her thick brown hair was spread out around her. There was both anger and hurt in those eyes, her jaw was set stubbornly and her slightly crooked teeth were bared. She was, as I thought, completely naked. She was lightly muscled from honest work helping at the tavern, but her slim form and small breasts suddenly seemed much less appealing in the cold light. It made me realize just how young she was. Even if Sila was past marrying age for elves her short stature, slim build, and flat chest made her look childlike. I felt guilty for having let my thoughts wander in this direction on more than one occasion, and the thought of continuing made me feel sick. Worse still I’d led her on to believe that this was something I wanted from her.

“Sila, we can’t do this, and especially not before I’m about to leave,” I said gently.

“Why won’t you just give me what I want?” she half pleaded, half demanded, though she stopped trying to tear herself free.

I let go of her wrists, “I can’t Sila, not when I’m about to leave, not when I think of the consequences that I might end up leaving you to deal with.”

She started to cry quietly, and sat up to bury her face in my chest. Seeing her tiny, slim, naked form clinging to my chest only made me feel worse and I put out the Light. She pulled herself together a short while later. Without a word she pulled away from me, and slipped out of the room.

*Good job Quinn, that’s one hell of a goodbye.*

-----

# Chapter 9

I woke up an hour or two before dawn, and I could still hear the rain crashing against the window shutters. I cast Light to help me navigate the small room as I prepared for the day. I shaved, not sure how often I’d be able to while out on the road. Pell and I had managed to make some fairly good straight razor blades, but even if I sharpened them with the multitool I wasn’t sure how long they’d last. Steel straight razor blades could last a long damn time, but these ones were bronze, and it wasn’t like I had a proper sharpener.

I could hear the floor creak as Moss left his room and headed down for breakfast, I followed a short time later. I came down to see Moss and Pell speaking quietly at one of the tables, and I could hear Phelio moving around in the kitchen. She had come along to see off her husband, and she’d join him in Colos once the business was in decent shape. I took a seat at the table and Phelio brought breakfast out to us before taking a seat in the chair next to her husband.

As we ate we went over our travel plans for today. We’d leave a bit before the sunrise and make our way towards Letea, the most southerly village in the valley, arriving an hour or so before dinner. I’d tried to push for a faster pace, eating lunch in Letea instead of on the road, to arrive at a small way station just on the other side of the pass leading out of the valley just before nightfall.

“Not everyone has got your super-elven endurance Quinn, and it’s going to be a hard enough to get to Letea carrying all of this,” Said Pell, gesturing at the supplies and aluminum ingots that the others were bringing along, “Without trying to sprint the whole way.”

“Alright,” I said, raising my hands in surrender.

One thing I’d noticed over the past several months was that elves seem disproportionally strong for their size. It wasn’t an ant like strength to mass ratio, but it was noticeable. Despite their slim builds and shorter stature the average elf seemed stronger than the average human. Pell was probably an above average example of elfin strength, but I was pretty sure that even Harp was a bit stronger than me, despite being more than a foot shorter and quite a bit lighter. I’d noticed rather early on though that my endurance seemed to be much higher than that of anyone I’d met so far. Even despite my laziness I could keep working at the forge far longer than Pell could, and I needed to take far fewer breaks. To some extent that was due to my heavy focus on cardio training prior to ending up here, but he seemed to have less endurance even than your average slightly pudgy office worker. If humans were persistence hunters descended from plains apes then my guess was that elves were descended from forest apes and were either ambushers or trappers. They’d be optimized for quick bursts of strength but would be unable to keep going for very long after that. Though from what I could tell the elves had stopped eating meat long ago and had restricted themselves to a mostly vegetable diet, eating only the animal products that could be taken without killing the animal.

Sila came down a little while later, dressed for travel, and she set her pack down next to her chair. The others had been so kind as to leave the chair next to me empty for Sila, and she pulled herself onto it. Phelio had already left a plate there for Sila and she ate quietly while the others chatted, clearly excited for the journey ahead. As far as I knew even Moss hadn’t been out of the valley for a while and was looking forward to traveling again. I’d realized that for the rest of the people at the table Colos was an incredible distance away, and that despite their long lifespans it was entirely possible that save for this trip they might live their entire lives in the valley. *It’s what, 90 miles from here to Colos? Less even as the crow flies. It was nearly 160 miles to get from Algonquin Park back to Toronto.*

Judging from Phelio’s expression I think that she noticed the awkwardness between Sila and I, though she didn’t say anything. I was guessing that she attributed the silence to the imminent separation of two close friends, rather than the aborted attempt to get it on. Phelio didn’t push the issue, and thankfully Moss and Pell seemed oblivious to the situation. Sila and I finished our breakfast in silence, and a short time later the lot of us gathered our things and set out for Letea.

-----

By noon it was still pretty cold and the weather hadn’t cleared, this had made me very thankful for my modern clothing and equipment. The others were wearing coats made out of a sort of coarse plant fibre and coated with some sort of plant based wax. It was fine if you were a farmer and were already ducking into your house to take frequent breaks, it was less good if you were traveling long distances without anywhere to stop to dry off and warm up. The others were already complaining of the cold when we set off, and in the time since then they’d been soaked through to the skin. I on the other hand was doing just fine. My jacket had held up through the winter and the hydrophobic coating hadn’t worn off like I feared it would. I’d already been through the whole of winter with only it and my hoodie, so a brisk spring day was no problem. My Gore-Tex shoes kept my feet dry and the only bit of me that was a little wet were the bottoms of my jeans. All the same I needed to get them dry and warm, it wasn’t cold enough for them to freeze, but hypothermia was still a risk.

I found a suitable spot on the side of the road at the crest of a hill, the ground was still rather wet but the water wasn’t going to pool here so it was about as dry as it was going to get. I pointed it out to the others, it being rather hard to hear over the pounding rain, and Moss gave me a hand stringing up my tarp. It wasn’t fantastic at keeping the water off a campsite, I’d originally designed it as a sort of one man tent, but it was waterproof and was better than nothing.

“Quinn!” Pell shouted over the rain.

“What?”

“You’re insane!” he shouted, “I thought you were going to exhaust yourself trying to get to Nimre, now I know the truth. You’ll drown long before then!”

I laughed, and it was a big belly laugh. I was glad just to be on the road, finally on my way to Nimre, finally leaving the excruciating boredom of this tiny valley. I probably had a big stupid grin on my face since I’d left the tavern, even as the others were wet and miserable from the weather and the cold.

“Back home, I did this for fun, aren’t you having fun Pell?”

“Pell’s right, you’re insane,” said Moss, barely audible over the rain.

We set up a fire, though it took some time to get the tinder to light. If I’d been able to pump more power into ignite I bet I could have gotten it blazing much more quickly, but as it was I simply cast several copies of the spell and gave the tinder a little time to dry out. I’d found out early on that I could maintain about five spells at once before I started to have difficulty, and it could be any combination of the spells I had. I could sometimes get a sixth spell going but it was tricky to hold the other five in my mind and cast the sixth, so it didn’t always work. Sometimes when it failed it would even disrupt my other spells and I’d lose one or two of the ones I already had going, so I tended to stick to five or fewer.

Pell setup his little wire stand and hung a pot over the fire. We weren’t short on water so Moss started a nice vegetable soup. We sat around the fire and ate, the hearty soup doing a lot to warm everyone up. They weren’t going to be able to dry off all the way, but the chance to rest was as refreshing psychologically as it was physically. It gave the others the energy to slog through the next dozen or so miles to Letea.

-----

We got into town a bit later than we’d planned, and I could see that the others were right at the limit of their endurance. Their eyes were a little wild, breath ragged, and they were all somewhat unsteady on their feet. I was also getting a little sore, but between the frequent breaks and slower pace I knew that when it came time to head out on my own I’d be able to keep to my schedule. I followed them through the village as they stumbled to the local tavern and when we got there Sila nearly fell through the front door into the common room. Thankfully we were expected, and there were warm baths and dry clothes waiting for us when we arrived. None of us needed to be told twice, and we made our way upstairs to the rooms that had been prepared for us.

The inn in Letea was rather nicer than I’d been expecting, I’d thought that there’d be two rooms with a couple of tubs each like Harp had at his tavern, but here they’d been brought into the individual rooms we’d be staying in for the night. I was rather glad for the privacy, back at Harp’s tavern I’d always taken my baths very late to avoid others walking in, but it wasn’t a foolproof solution. The elves didn’t seem to have the same privacy standards as I was used to, and it had been jarring in the first few weeks. The sheets also looked nicer than the ones in Essens, it wasn’t as soft as cotton might be but it was better than the linen sheets I’d gotten used to. *I suppose Letea has an easier time getting products and visitors from outside of the valley.* The tub unfortunately, like the bed, was really quite undersized for someone my height, but it didn’t matter. I luxuriated in the warmth, and I didn’t leave until well after the water had cooled to room temperature.

-----

I’d gotten dressed and just stepped out my room and into the hallway, when Sila opened the door across the hall from me. I could see that she had a bundle of dark blue cloth clutched in one hand. We hadn’t spoken to each other at all since the previous night, not at breakfast, and not on the road. She stood in the doorway to her room, long brown hair was still wet from the bath. Her jaw was set, though her huge brown eyes were looking down at the floor.

“Here,” she said quietly, holding out the bundle of cloth.

I took it, shaking it out. It was my shirt, the one I’d been wearing during the fight with Anthior and his friends all those months ago. The long gash in the side had been mended with a patch of linen, though it was a much lighter blue than the rest of the shirt. It looked like it had been stuck in place, rather than sewn. I felt inside the shirt, and could feel at another patch of linen holding the other side of the cut together. Phelio had tried to mend it for me after the fight, it was one of only two shirts I had after all, but the cotton-spandex blend didn’t really cooperate. I eventually told her not to bother, and I got myself a couple of linen shirts. I’d assumed that my shirt had been recycled in some way, though it looked like Sila had taken it and figured out a way to mend it.

“I tried to sew it back together, but the fabric just kept pulling apart,” she explained quietly, “I hope the way I did it is okay. I kept trying to dye it to match and make it look neater, but I couldn’t get the blue to be any darker than this.”

“It’s perfect Sila, thank you.” I said softly.

She looked like she was about to say something more, but decided against it. She pulled the door to her room closed and scampered off down to the common room, leaving me there holding my newly repaired shirt and feeling awful.

-----

I came downstairs for dinner after putting the shirt away, and I could hear Moss’s voice as I walked down the creaky steps.

“And the whole damned time, there’s Quinn, big stupid grin on his face stomping along like some sort of mad giant. Today was bad enough, and he says he’s gonna do twice that, every day! Ah, there he is,” he said, noticing me enter, “and he’s **still** smiling like a lunatic.”

“Aw, that’s just because I like hearing such nice things said about me. You’re Atis right?” I asked, offering my hand to the only unfamiliar face at the table.

He took it and we traded grips, “Yeah, and damn you’re a big one. What are you, part giant?”

“Human,” I said, “We’re sort of like elves, just bigger, and no pointy ears.”

“Human, that’s a new one for me. Where abouts do humans come from?” He asked, the question giving me reason to pause.

“Banestorm,” Moss supplied, “He’s on a quest to Nimre to discover the arcane secrets that will give him the power to save the world.”

*Well. I guess that’s one way to put it.*

I looked over at Moss, hands spread apart and an exasperated look on my face.

“What?” He asked, “Oh come now, I know you don’t like to brag about it but it’s the truth.”

I looked over at Atis, who had a wide-eyed expression, “He’s not telling stories?” He asked.

“It’s true, all except for the saving the world part. I’m mostly in this for myself. I’m going to try for the sort of pragmatic anti-hero though, rather than a legendary virtuous hero.”

Atis just blinked.

“It’s not that important, don’t worry about it,” I said, waving a hand, “I have a question though, it looks like you get more traffic through here than the rest of the village, am I right?”

It took him a moment to process what must have been gibberish to him, I guess antiheros weren’t really a subject of local legend, but he answered, “Yeah, yeah, both the dwarves and the city folk tend to come by here to trade. Dwarves don’t want to go too far from their mountains, and the city folk don’t want to make the trek all the way up the valley and through a second mountain pass. Come summer and Athes’s shop will be stocked with plenty of goods from both sides.”

*Greetings from the mountainhome. Your efforts are legend there. Let us trade!*

“And you’ve never seen any humans come through to see what the dwarves have left?” I asked.

“Never, never even heard the word until late last fall when Moss came by.”

“So no other humans, but there are,” I said, counting off on my fingers, “Elves, dwarves, gnomes, orcs, giants… anything else?”

“Well city folk’ll try to tell you that high elves is a different sort of elf than us,” he explained, *Hey, fantasy racism, hooray!* “and there’s some of the minor races, nymphs, dryads, goblins, that sorta thing. But there’s not a lot of them around.”

“Rhona, Adympia, and Nimre, those are all elf kingdoms right?”

“Uh,” Atis looked over at Moss.

“Yeah, it’s not till you go pretty far north that you start to find lands controlled by orcs or giants,” Moss supplied, “Adympia likes to take orc and giant slaves though, you’ll want to be careful if you end up passing through there Quinn. They might think you’re a funny coloured orc or a short giant.”

*Note to self, do not become slave.*

“What do they usually use orc or giant slaves for?” I asked, I wanted to get an idea of the risks I’d be taking if sea travel wasn’t an option.

“Well it depends, but it’s usually hard labour, sometimes they’ll offer freedom in exchange for military service though. Pretty sure most farmers in Adympia are orcs or giants,” *Manual labour, my only weakness.* “You though might catch some lordling’s eye. I hear some of them collect freaks and, sorry, I don’t mean it like that Quinn.”

“Its fine, go on,” I said, interested.

“Well some lords collect unique specimens. When there’s a Banestorm in Admypia there’s always a race between the noble houses to get men to the site to collect whatever comes though. One thing though Quinn, don’t let them know you’re a Mage, not ever. Better to work in the mines, yeah even for you,” he said, noting my expression at that last remark, “They don’t abide free Mages. I heard they even test their nobles for magic, and if they do have magic even they end up as slaves. Usually their family’ll buy them back, but that’s no life Quinn.”

“I don’t know. Enslaving someone seems about the worst thing you can do to someone. Is it that much worse to be a slave with magic?”

“Yeah, there’s rules Quinn, rights even slaves have. From what I heard a bookkeeping slave or scribe doesn’t have it that bad, even farmers and miners got a life and there’s rules on how they can be treated. Can’t break up families, can’t force yourself on any of the women slaves, can’t kill them without reason. Mages and Wizards though? There’s no rules, nobles will do as they like.” Moss said solemnly, and Atis was nodding along with an almost sick expression on his face.

“Well, I really hope I can find a ship then. I don’t want to run into an enterprising Admypian looking for a quick buck. I don’t want to try crossing the kingdom through the bush either. It would delay me far too long, and I have no idea if I’d even be able to find enough food.”

We chatted for a while longer, though Sila went up to bed early. She hadn’t said much of anything while we were talking. The rest of us played a couple games of Zatrikion, and Moss got the Scholar’s Mate off on Atis once before we all went off to bed.

# Chapter 10

Despite the nicer rooms here in Letea, I still had a hard time sleeping. Even after several months of living in the valley I hadn’t quite gotten used to sleeping in what passed for a bed here. Linen sheets and mattresses stuffed with straw were quite a downgrade from 900 thread count cotton sheets and a memory foam mattress. It was a little nicer here in Letea, the sheets were some sort of almost-cotton and the mattress seemed like they were stuffed with down, but the bed was still over a foot too short. Maybe I was being a bit of a diva, but even with all the time I’d had to get used to life in the village, sleeping was still a problem for me.

According to my watch it was 4:30 when I woke up. I tried to get back to sleep, but it just wasn’t happening. I had some time to kill, so I pulled out one of the maps the Baron gave me and cast Light a couple of times. It would be another hour and a half before the others woke so I thought I might as well do something productive. I had a couple of maps, but the ones that stretched as far as Nimre did not have the same level of detail. They’d show cities and towns of at least 1000 people, but the villages and way-stations that connected them were not shown. I could still see the main roads though and if I had to walk to Nimre I’d probably be fine if I stuck to them, at least until I got to Adympia.

The particular map I had pulled out was the one which showed the entire continent of Elardia, it looked like someone with a poor understanding of geography had tried to sketch out Europe. I was currently in the kingdom of Rhona which occupied sort of the same area as Italy. Though it looked like someone had hacked off the boot of Italy a bit above the knee, and the resulting landmass looked sort of like India had been dropped into Italy’s place. France was still there, looking roughly France shaped. Germany was somewhat recognizable as well, though it had gotten a haircut and Denmark was missing entirely. Adympia covered all of what I thought of as France, along with a decent portion of south western ‘Germany’. England and Scandinavia were gone, and eastern Europe mostly faded out into an unspecific mass. The portions of ‘Germany’ not under Adympian control, along with eastern Europe, were labeled ‘Goblinoid Tribal Lands’. *Someone mentioned Orc tribes to the north, I guess Orcs are Goblinoids?* The Spain and Portugal equivalents existed, though they’d been relocated. Instead of jutting out of the south-western corner of France, the Iberian Peninsula jutted out of the north-western corner. Nimre was roughly Portugal sized, and in about the same place. The rest of ‘Spain’ was split between two kingdoms, Karka and Ashur. Ashur was about the same size as Nimre, and was spread across the southern coast of ‘Spain’. Karka occupied the whole of the remaining portion, though that still left it smaller than Adympia.

From what I could tell though, a lot of Adympia’s land wasn’t doing a whole lot. The map didn’t show the villages, but nearly the entire northern half of what Adympia claimed seemed mostly uninhabited. Judging by the number of cities, it actually looked like Adympia wasn’t a whole lot more powerful than any of the other Kingdoms on the continent. Ashur especially seemed very urbanized, at least for a Bronze age civilization. All of the kingdoms seemed to have most of their cities along the southern coast of the continent, and the few large inland cities were all on rivers large enough to be marked on the continent scale map. Much like Classical Greece, naval power was definitely the focus here in Elardia. Though that did leave Karka as the odd man out, since its coastline was all rather northerly. I didn’t know if they were far enough north for their ports to freeze in the winter, but judging from the map that wasn’t a concern that any other kingdom had to contend with. Indeed, while the capital cities of the other kingdoms were all coastal, Karka’s was on one of the large rivers. Not only that, the river in question only reached the sea by passing through Nimre. *These guys are either going to be close allies, or they’ll be trying to kill each other constantly*

The other major difference between Elardia and Europe was the scale. On earth the trip from eastern Italy to south west Portugal couldn’t have been much more than a thousand miles. Here though the trip was more like *five* thousand miles, which was borne out both by the scale on the map, and by my estimated travel time. *Hold on a second, that means… Adympia has got to be what, the size of Russia? It’s not just five times the size of France, it’s twenty five times the size. How the hell do they keep such large kingdoms together?*

I did not have an answer, so bored with the map I pulled out the little spell book that had started me on my journey. I’d need to figure out what to do with it if I couldn’t find a ship to Nimre. Getting caught in Adympia would be bad enough, but I didn’t want to deal with whatever worse fate faced Mages that were captured and carrying around a spellbook would kind of be a giveaway. Hopefully my mage stone ring wasn’t quite as obvious, though the thought of the stone brought something to mind. I’d had to work for it to get the stone to light up, it hadn’t just lit up the second I’d touched the stone. But if what Moss said about the Adympians testing nobles for magic was true then they must have some alternative way to detect it. Otherwise the noble just wouldn’t put the required effort in, and the stone would stay dark. I’d be in really bad shape if they tested every potential slave for magic as a matter of course.

I put the spell book in an outside pocket where it would be easy to reach. If worst came to worst and I was going to get captured I’d want to be able to ditch the book before they found me with it. My notebook would need to go too since it’s full of my magical notes, such as they are.

I flipped through the book, recalling much of the testing I’d done. I’d had visions of becoming some sort of techno-mage, blasting my foes with X-Ray lasers and hyper-sonic projectiles. Unfortunately the spells were just too limited to do anything like that. I had a high school chemistry set, not a nuclear physics lab. I hadn’t been able to make sense of the symbols either. Once I’d run through all the tests to see what the spells could do I tried to test *how* the spells did what they did, but I had even less luck there. I figured that the symbols that ‘taught’ the spell must have had some sort of structure, so I tried looking for patterns or similarities. I’d guessed that Dowsing and Detect Magic might have some common themes, since one looked for magic, and the other looked for water. I was hoping for something to jump off the page, maybe a symbol that the two spells shared that I could label ‘Detect’, but I had no such luck. It wasn’t going to be as simple as taking Detect Magic or Dowsing, cutting out the reference to Magic or Water, and pasting in a bit of the Ignite spell to get a Detect Fire spell. *Trouble is, I just don’t know what I don’t know. Hell, I’ll probably sit down in ‘how to Mage, 101’ and the first class will explain what each of these symbols do and how they do them.*

I had eventually gotten some combat utility out of Apportation though. I’d tried floating knives and such, but they had so little force behind them that it was ultimately useless. I could drag the blade across someone and hope to nick an artery, but 10lbs of force is not a lot. All it would take is for someone to try to bat the knife aside and I’d lose my grip on it. It might scare people to see a man with a bunch of flying knives, but that wasn’t going to help if someone was really out for blood. Instead I’d worked out how to use Apportation to augment my archery. Apportation essentially gave me an extra set of hands, and I intended to take advantage of that. Rather than reach over my shoulder to grab a new arrow after every shot, I’d use Apportation to grab the arrow. This meant that I could leave both hands on the bow, and redraw as soon as the arrow was loosed. Not only did this bump up my rate of fire, but it was also meant that I was a bit steadier when nocking the arrow since Apportation let me do it with two hands, instead of just one.

After procrastinating for long enough I started to hear people moving around in the hallway outside my room, and I took that as my cue to go down for breakfast.

-----

It was about noon when we arrived at the pass between the mountains, and we stopped to eat before braving the pass. It had finished raining at some point last night, but the others were still having a rough time of it. Nearly all the ground we’d covered since leaving Letea had been uphill, and the rough terrain had taken its toll on the rest of the group. Their shoes left much to be desired, in fact they could only be loosely considered shoes. One downside to not using any animal parts was that you didn’t really have anything comparable to leather for shoemaking materials. They all had the tire-tread shoes that had been made after taking apart the car, but they were still very basic. My shoes had been sized properly, I had insoles, and the left and right shoes were matched to the shape of the foot. As far as I knew the shoes were either in “men’s” size or “women’s” size which meant they fit poorly, and worse than that there was no difference between right and left. Insoles were entirely out of the question, I think that they best they had was a bit of cloth padding inside the shoe.

*Yeah. I have the best shoes on the planet.*

Even with my much greater endurance, I knew that there was no way I’d be able to make the trip on foot with shoes like they were wearing. I had some general notion that you could get used to walking barefoot and have it be as comfortable as a decent pair of shoes, but it would take too long to adapt to the change. My success was going to be as much about my shoes and coat, as it was going to be about any ‘super-elven’ endurance.

Pell collapsed onto a suitable tree stump, as Moss started up a fire. Moss had been foraging as we were going along, and by the time we’d stopped he had quite the collection of vegetables. I’d not been terribly interested in learning what could and could not be eaten, I’d decided that if I got to the point where I needed to forage for food then I had bigger problems, but I’d kept an eye on what he was doing. Some of what he’d collected I could actually recognize, but the rest were roots and tubers that I would never have looked at as edible. I suppose that was one downside to having plenty of academic knowledge, but very little practical knowledge. The food was pretty decent though, I’d been expecting something awful tasting but technically good for you, and instead the roots and tubers mostly just tasted like carrots and potatoes.

“How bad is the pass going to be Moss?” Asked Pell, who had never left the valley before.

“It’s probably not too bad, there is a proper road that leads out of the valley. Parts might be washed out from the spring melt, but it should be clear most of the way now that nearly all of the snow’s melted.”

 We cleaned up after ourselves, elves could put boy scouts to shame when it came to ‘leaving nothing but footprints’, and we headed into the pass. The road was a narrow gravel strip, about wide enough for a single cart to pass. On the left rose one of the mountains that made up the border between the valley and the rest of Rhona. On the right the ground dropped away sharply to meet a river that flowed down from the mountains, fed by the melting snow. The river was flowing very quickly, and the water that wasn’t white from the rapids was brown from all the silt and grit collected from the water’s trip down the side of the mountain.

We were about an hour from the end of the pass, and two hours from our way-station when we found a rather substantial problem. It looked like the water from the melting snow or the earlier rain storm had washed out part of the road. The cliff had collapsed into the river in a wide arc leaving only a strip about a foot wide, with the rubble from the collapsed road slopping down into the river at a very steep angle.

“Well, it could be worse,” I said.

“How could it be worse? The road’s gone!” said Pell.

“I can still see a bit of road there,” Moss said, gesturing towards the narrow strip that remained, “that’s plenty of road, we’ll need to let someone in Colos know though. We won’t be getting any traders in the valley until the road is fixed.”

“I think I’ve got to go first, actually, probably best if I go last.” I said, thinking of how much I hated heights.

“Wait, what do you mean?” Asked Sila.

“Well either I go first because I’m the heaviest, and if it’s going to collapse it’s going to collapse when I cross. Or I go last because if it collapses at least no one will be stuck on the wrong side.”

“Oh I do not need to think about that right now,” said Pell.

“You’re last I think Quinn, I’ll go, then Sila, then Pell, then you,” said Moss, and he looked to the others, “Don’t take your time, don’t creep across. Just walk straight across as if we’re still just walking down the road, the less time you spend out there the better.”

Sila and Pell nodded, suddenly very serious, they seemed glad to defer to the more experienced traveler. Moss, calm as ever, took a deep breath and walked right across the ledge. Sila seemed very reluctant to cross, and Pell didn’t seem like he was in too much of a hurry either.

“Come on, you’ll be fine girl, just walk right over to me,” said Moss, motioning her over.

I could see Sila centre herself, hesitate, and then sprint across the ledge. She nearly bowled Moss over when she got to the other side, but she’d made it. Pell followed shortly after, though at a calmer pace. Then it was my turn. I’m honestly terrified of heights, but there was no way in hell I was going to let anyone else know about that, so before I could convince myself that this was a terrible idea I walked out onto the ledge.

And it was a terrible idea.

I was about halfway across, and had just put my weight down on my right foot when I felt the ground underneath start to fall away. I was committed to the step and couldn’t pull back, so I threw myself forwards with my hands outstretched. I didn’t quite have the leverage I needed as the ground fell away under me, but I managed to throw myself far enough forwards to land with my upper body on the road. I couldn’t get purchase on anything with my hands, and pushing against the rubble as it slid into the river was not helping. Sila ran forwards to try to try to help, but Moss grabbed her around the waist and hauled her back. Right before the cliff around me collapsed, and I fell into the gorge.

-----

I was totally going to end it here for tonight, but that just felt cruel.

-----

I heard Sila scream my name, “QUINN!”, as I tumbled down the scree like slope. It wasn’t quite vertical, and I managed to slow my fall slightly, though I probably collected a lot of bruises in the process. I was able to avoid hitting my head on anything on the way down, but I landed in the river head first. I plunged into the water and with one arm I just barely managed to keep my head from hitting any of the rocks jutting up out of the river bed. I felt the impact all the way up to my shoulder and my arm went numb.

Damn it was cold, and it took me a second to work out which way was up. It was impossible to see anything in the murky brown water, and I only found my bearings when I was slammed into one of the rocks protruding from the river bed. I was able to get my head above water, and I took a gasping breath. I looked around, clinging to the rock with my one good arm, and trying to figure out how the hell to get out of the freezing water. The fall and the sudden introduction to freezing water had rattled me and made it really hard to think. It looked like the current would at least carry me away from the valley, and no opportunity to escape the river presented itself as I looked around. Both sides were sheer, and even if I managed to pull myself to a stop on the side of the cliff there was no way in hell I’d be able to climb, and not with only one good arm. I was going to have to do my best to avoid drowning or breaking anything else while I let the river carried me out of the mountains. It was not going to be a short swim, it would have taken us another hour to get clear of the mountains if we’d been walking, and while the river was moving along a whole lot quicker than walking speed even a single minute was going to feel like an eternity. Especially when I’d be swimming with only one arm, I bit the bullet though, and pushed off of the rock.

 I managed not to bash my brains out against anything while going through the rest of the rapids, and about a year later I was finally out of the pass. I managed to drag myself out of the water at a bend in the river, and I collapsed onto the rough pebbles at the riverbank. I might have been in the river for fewer than five minutes, but I was absolutely spent. I tried to push myself up, but even if both arms had worked, I just did not have the strength. I knew I needed to get warm and dry as soon as possible, but I was finding that difficult at the moment. Instead I started with simple things, like checking on the state of my arm. I managed to pull off my sodden hoodie, thankfully it zipped in the front so I wasn’t tweaking my shoulder too much. I took a look at the arm, and I had a tingly, buzzing sensation as I started to regain feeling in my arm. I felt very carefully along it, and it didn’t feel like anything was broken. Granted, I was going to have a hard time knowing for sure without obvious signs like bloody shards of bone sticking up out of my skin. I massaged the arm, trying to regain feeling, and as I did I felt more and more pain in my right shoulder. It seemed like I’d jammed the joint, rather than breaking any of my bones.

Finally I felt strong enough to stand, and I made the lengthy and arduous trek from the river bank, to the road a short distance away. Exhausted from my journey I collapsed back down onto the road, breath coming in ragged gasps. I took a look in my bag, dreading what I might find. Sure enough the contents were ruined. The spellbook was a sodden heap, the maps had basically flaked apart, the drink powders I’d been saving for a special occasion made the inside of the bag stick, and the stupid packet of Cepacol only made that worse, my phone *Fuck* was full of water, and the pemmican was unrecognizable. All ruined. The Maglite at least still lit up, and the phone could probably be dried out if I was careful with it. I looked over Franken-Bow, I was terrified that I might have crushed it in the tumble down the cliff or in the lengthy swim, but it seemed okay.

*1 hour’s walk to the way-station, 1 hour to wait for the group, assuming they don’t wait around trying to find me near where I fell. This has not gone well.*

An hour was too long to wait, I was already shivering, and if I waited I was going to get hypothermic well before they arrived. I could get out of my wet clothes, but into what? Aside from having nothing dry to wear I also had nothing to dry off with. Trying to collect enough wood for a fire would be damn near impossible as well.

I looked around and I could count the number of nearby trees on half the fingers on one hand. I could see the smoke from the way-station though, far off in the distance.

*1 hour to walk, at least at the speed the elves walk. So it’s maybe 4 miles away? This is going to suck.*

I threw everything that had been ruined out of my bag and onto the road, saving only my phone. I did not want to be carrying useless weight, and hopefully the others would see this here and get the idea that I wasn’t dead, and had in fact gone to the way-station.

I stood up, already well past the point of exhaustion, and started running.

*Five minute mile, 4 miles, 20 minutes. I am so gonna die.*

-----



# Chapter 11

I didn’t die. Which was nice.

By the time I got to the way-station I was delirious and could barely run in a straight line. The runner’s high did a lot to dampen my feeling that my heart was about to burst, but it also made me loopy. I collapsed against the door frame, still soaked from the dunk in the river, and it took me a minute to figure out how to work the door handle. I pushed open the door to find the room empty except for a tiny, compared to me, woman cleaning one of the tables. She looked up from her task upon hearing the door, and I could see a combination of confusion and shock on her face.

“Hi,” I said, right before I passed out.

-----

My head hurt like hell when I woke up, but I was warm and dry at least. Feeling had returned to my arm as well. It was a really unpleasant feeling since my shoulder hurt like hell, but I wasn’t crippled. I lifted my other hand to my head, and felt at it. I could feel a lump on my forehead, I’d probably bounced my head off the floor when I passed out. The rest of me was also very sore, which was not helped by the fact that the bed, again, was too short. I was kind of crumpled up to fit in the small bed, I guess whoever dragged me up here hadn’t really known what else to do with me. I sat up against the headboard to try to stretch out my legs, which helped with the soreness a little, and I noticed for the first time that I was naked. I took a look around the room, hopefully my clothes were somewhere in here. I could see wan sunlight coming in through the window, it looked like it was evening of the same day, I couldn’t have been out for more than an hour or two. The furnishings were rustic, rougher even than the furnishings in Harp’s tavern. My watch and glasses were on the side table, and I could see that the glasses looked a little crooked. I suppose I’d fallen face first onto them when I passed out, and I suddenly realized how lucky I was not to lose them in the river. There were also some clothes piled next to my belongings, though they weren’t mine.

*If it’s only been a couple hours then mine are probably still soaked.*

The clothes were definitely too short, but they were workable. The shirt was a bit tight in the shoulders and the arms were too short, but my waist isn’t that wide and the pants fit, even if they did look like capris on someone my height. I rolled the sleeves up on the shirt and stood up, careful not to hit my head on the low ceiling. I was barefoot, which wasn’t great on the rough wood floor. I took the opportunity to confirm that I hadn’t lost any toes, and I could see that I still had all my fingers as well. I’d already checked on the most important of my appendages when I’d first sat up.

I opened the door, ducking further under the door frame, and stepped out into the hall to look around. There were several more doors along the hall, presumably leading to more rooms, and I could hear what sounded like Pell’s voice on my left. The hall opened up into the common room, just a bit behind and to the side of the bar. The others were seated at one of the tables and were talking to the woman from earlier, it sounded like they were explaining what had happened. Pell looked up sharply when he saw me.

“Quinn,” he exclaimed, looked concerned “You should be in bed!”

I waved one hand dismissively, “I’m fine. I’m warmed up now and I’ll be rested enough to travel by morning.”

“You could have told me,” said the woman from earlier, “I thought a giant’d walked in and dropped dead on my floor. You looked frozen and half drowned.”

“Well, you were basically right except for the being dead thing. Thank you for all the help, and also the clothes,” I said, gesturing down at myself. I could see the clothes from my pack hanging near the fire to dry.

She opened her mouth to respond, but Sila interrupted her, “What happened? We thought you’d died! I thought for sure you’d break your neck and drown, I was terrified that we’d come upon your body washed up on the side of the river! Why didn’t you come back to tell us you were alright? When we saw your things in the road I thought a bandit had taken all your things!” Sila was taking quickly, and she was on the verge of tears.

I took a seat at the table, “Would you like something to eat?” the innkeeper cut in before I began.

“Certainly, thank you very much,” and she went off to the woodstove behind the bar to put something together, “Well I didn’t fall right into the river, I sort of slid down the slope which helped to slowed me down. That and the water meant that I didn’t hit the river bottom and break anything. I did jam my shoulder though,” I said, rolling my injured shoulder, “I managed to get out of the river once I was free of the pass. I would have waited for you, but I was wet and freezing. You guys were still an hour away, so I ran as fast as I could to the inn. The run kept me warm enough to not freeze, and it got me here in time to warm up and get dry. I hoped you’d get the idea that I was alive from the stuff I left on the trail, but I didn’t really have time to stick around.”

This did not seem like a satisfactory explanation to Sila, and she still looked like she was going to cry. *I guess we’re still not quite finished with each other, are we.*

Moss shook his head slowly, “I thought for sure that you were dead Quinn, for all that Sila was hoping you weren’t,” at this Sila glanced towards Moss and turned a little pink, “The fall or the cold would have killed any elf, even an orc wouldn’t have the strength to swim for that long.”

“Well to be fair, I was mostly just treading water. The river did most of the moving and I kinda got dragged along with it, most of the difficulty was from trying not to smash my head open against the cliff or any of the boulders in the river.”

It turned out that it was not the right thing to say. I could tell that it was not the right thing to say because Sila immediately burst into tears.

Maybe I just lack empathy, but I find it annoying when people near me start crying. I don’t know what the hell I’m supposed to do with myself in that situation, and I usually end up standing or sitting there awkwardly waiting for them to stop. Am I supposed to say something comforting? Should I give them a hug? It’s damned inconvenient, and somehow the whole thing ends up being my fault. Thankfully Sila solved my predicament for me by running off down the hall, presumably to her own room to cry some more.

Pell and Moss looked at me like I’d just kicked a puppy, and I could feel the innkeepers disapproving eyes on my back.

“So I guess that was the wrong thing to say?”

Pell put his head in his hands and Moss rolled his eyes. I threw up my hands, and the innkeeper *inkeepress?* brought over stew for everyone. She gave me a look that said *You are a stupid, stupid man, squandering the attentions of a beautiful woman.*

I just sat there and ate my damn stew.

-----

I managed to browbeat the others into continuing on the following morning, despite the fact that they seemed to think I’d drop dead if I walked one more step. I did take the opportunity to sleep in a little though, I had been exhausted enough to pass right out despite the bed being uncomfortably small. We ended up leaving for Colos at around 8am, and I was glad to finally be on my way to what passed for civilization here in Rhona.

Sila had fortunately calmed down from the previous evening, though she’d gone back to not talking to me. The others were pretty quiet as well, saving their breath for the day’s journey. Hiking with elves was quite a lot quieter than hiking with other humans. When I was in Algonquin Park all those months ago with my friends we had chatted nearly the whole way, pointing out interesting sights or animals, but elves seemed much less talkative. They seemed to have a hard enough time just covering the distance in a reasonable amount of time, so they avoided getting thirsty and out of breath from talking the whole way.

Instead as I walked I thought about my plans for Colos. Ideally I was going to stay in the city for the one night, gamble a little, and then the following morning I’d start out for Myra. If I kept to my schedule I’d stop that night in a village just outside of Myra, and I’d be able to get to Myra around noon the day after that. The rest of the day in Myra would be spent looking for a ship to Nimre, and if I was lucky I’d have found a ship and be on my way by the fourth or fifth day. I’d accounted for a week spent looking for transportation. In theory I could push that further, but then I’d be cutting into the days I’d set aside for resting. Granted, if I found a ship then I’d potentially be weeks ahead of schedule, but it could just as easily be the case that there weren’t going to be any suitable ships for some time. I couldn’t waste time waiting for a ship that would never come. Another potential delay that might cut into my week looking for ships would be if Moss and Pell expected me to help them get set up in Colos. I liked both of them, but I wanted to get the hell on my way.

Honestly, the others were probably right. If I was smart I would have spent a day or two resting after the ordeal in the river, but spending one more day sitting still would have driven me crazy. Fortunately the day’s travel was uneventful, and we arrived at Colos just as the sun was reaching the horizon.

-----

Surprisingly, the city didn’t stink. I’d been expecting medieval cities to be awful smelling trash heaps with terrible sanitation, but it seemed like elves had the whole thing sorted out. *Well I suppose they’d need to have things sorted out. I don’t think it was until the late Victorian era that more people would be born than died in cities. Elves have children so infrequently that they couldn’t maintain the city’s population with immigrants from the countryside like humans had historically.*

Pell and Sila were both looking around in awe as we approached the city ‘wall’, “This place is a fortress,” said Pell.

I looked over at Moss with a sceptical expression, and he shrugged. The ‘fortress’ was only a simple wooden palisade. Earth had been piled up against the inside to lend stability and to give the defenders a place to stand, but it was not terribly impressive. The gatehouse we were approaching was at least made of stone, and there were a few soldiers guarding the open gates. I’d been expecting some sort of challenge from the guards *Be yee friend or foe?* but we breezed right through, though I did get quite a few odd looks from the men at the gate. That was something that I should have spent more time considering, I was going to stick out like a six and a half foot sore thumb, and I didn’t have enough experience with elves to know if that was a good thing or a bad thing.

“Hey Moss, how do elves usually feel about strangers?” I inquired.

“You don’t mean strangers that look like freakish half-giant half-elf hybrids do you?”

“No, of course not.”

“Well I don’t really know how elves compare to humans, what are you worried about? How would a human respond to such a stranger?”

“Well that depends a lot on the society and time period,” I explained, “The only two obvious differences between me and an elf are the ears and the height difference. If a giant stranger passed through a town like this, but of humans rather than elves, then the stranger might be shunned or feared. Or the villagers might just think that the stranger was a little odd and carry on, as long as the giant didn’t make a nuisance of himself.”

“It’s much the same with elves I suppose, best thing to do is probably to avoid drawing attention to yourself,” I gave him a pointed look, “Well, don’t draw any more attention to yourself, and otherwise avoid trouble. Some elves will just take a dislike to you, but there’s not much you can do to please people like that.”

I nodded, thoughtful, “Alright, well where are we staying for the night then? I think this is the first place where we’ve had a choice of places to stay.”

“There’s an inn named The Dancing Stone near the Count’s manor, it’s where the merchants and nobles too unimportant to stay at the manor itself spend their time while waiting for the Count to see them.”

“Isn’t that going to be expensive?” Asked Pell, “I thought we needed to save our money to get ourselves started here in the city.”

“We *are* going to use the money to get ourselves started. We don’t have the money to buy a place to set up a workshop, and if we try to find a building to rent, our money might drain away before we get enough customers coming through. What we want to do is find a patron, someone who’s interested enough in what you’ve made to support us. And no one throws money around like bored merchants and nobles.”

“Bored merchants and nobles you say?” I said, grinning, “I wonder if they also like to waste time drinking and playing cards?”

-----

As it turns out, bored merchants and nobles do like to waste time drinking and playing cards.

We got in to The Dancing Stone right in the middle of dinner, and the inn was doing a rather good trade. My only concern going in had been that we weren’t really dressed for a fancy hotel, but I need not have worried. I’d been expecting a Bronze Age Marriott, but I hadn’t considered the realities of traveling in a Bronze Age society. Whether you walk, ride, or sail, most people aren’t going to be traveling around in a suit and tie. *Or would that be a doublet and cravat?* either way, we didn’t stand out. At least, the others didn’t. I drew attention immediately, though as it happened, that wasn’t a bad thing. While Moss was chatting up the owner, who was apparently an old friend, I was invited to take a seat with a group of the aforementioned bored noblemen after they noticed me looking over their game of dice with interest.

They seemed very curious, and while they were distracted asking their questions about my strange clothes and round ears, I managed to get Apportation in place to start fiddling with the dice. I’d noticed early on that I seemed to have no trouble keeping a spell up once it was cast. According to the book most of the spells took 1 mana every minute to maintain, but I seemed to maintain them with no difficulty. This further reinforced my hypothesis that I had one mana, or at least less than two, but with a really high recovery rate. Especially since I could have five such spells on at once, each taking one mana every minute.

Once I cast Apportation I didn’t have much trouble coming out ahead. The difficulty then was not about being careful enough to alter the dice in a way that looked natural, instead the trick was to carefully choose **when** to do it. I had plenty of practice making the altered rolls look natural, but winning too much will tip people off regardless, even if they come to the false assumption that it’s the dice that are fixed. Instead I’d only fix rolls in my favour on every tenth roll or so, I’d lose some, but I did it enough to win slightly more. In fact, most times when I altered a roll it was in someone else’s favour. If I got the impression that someone was running low on funds, or were about to leave, they’d get a suddenly lucky streak. I didn’t want any one person doing so poorly that they left, or so well that they quit while they were ahead. The longer they played the more I made. My strategy worked quite well, and by the end of the night I was 12 drachm richer.

-----

I woke up around seven the next morning, I was planning on saying goodbye, but I also wanted to get on my way as soon as possible. I had ships to catch and magic to learn. I came down to the common room to find it about half full. The actual travelers were already up and eating breakfast, while the noblemen were still in bed since they didn’t really have anywhere to be today. Even if the Count, *still don’t know what the Count’s name is,* called upon them today it wouldn’t be so early in the morning. I came down with my backpack over one shoulder, ready to travel. Hopefully Moss and Pell would get the idea, and not ask me to stick around to help them set up the business. I did feel slightly guilty, after all it had been my idea for Pell to setup here in Colos, but that didn’t make it my responsibility.

Moss, Pell, and Sila were sitting at a table with a couple other people. Pell had some of his goods sitting on the table, though Moss seemed to be leading the conversation, and Pell was not saying much. I ordered breakfast from one of the girls serving customers in the tavern, and then I sat at the table with my traveling companions. I nodded to Moss and the others as I sat, but did not interrupt his sales pitch.

“…As you know,” Moss was saying, and I was sure from the expressions of the other two men that they did not know, “Aluminum is very easy to work, which means that the costs to set up a proper workshop are a fraction the price of even what it takes to outfit a tinsmith. When compared to the potential profit it’s obvious that in very short order it would be possible for the Count to recoup his costs. Think of the prestige as well that could be earned for your uncle, while a Duke might pay patron to a personal goldsmith, Aluminum would be even more impressive.”

*I guess Moss skipped right to the Count himself, damn, he doesn’t waste time.*

The two men, teenagers really, seemed to consider this carefully for a moment. Or at least they tried to put on the expression of someone carefully considering something.

“What about when you run out though? You’ve only brought so much,” The kids were young, but evidently not stupid.

“Don’t worry,” Moss soothed, “We have more supplies than what we’ve brought along, we are not so foolish as to risk our whole supply traveling the roads. Not only that, but consider this. By the time the supplies run out, not only will your Uncle already be very wealthy, but Pell here will have had far more experience with Aluminum than any other smith in Rhona. Perhaps all of Elardia. If other nobles and royalty have aluminum, and wish for goods to be made of it then they might instead look to Pell, rather than take it to a local smith. They would of course want the greatest craftsman working such a rare material, it’s not something you would waste on an amateur. We could of course purchase more Aluminum with the money made selling our initial stock.”

 “Well,” said the other of the two nephews, the one who hadn’t asked the question. He looked over at his brother, unsure.

“I believe you make a very interesting case, I think we will relay this information to our Uncle, so that he may decide,” said the first brother, eager to pass the buck.

“Well, good day then,” said the second brother, a little awkwardly, and the two left.

I looked over at Moss and Pell, “Well that seems to have gone well.”

“It’s a good thing Moss came along with us to Colos. I’d have no idea how to try to sell my goods to men like that,” Pell said, seeming relieved that the two boys had left.

The *wench?* set my food in front of me, and I thanked her.

“Men, pah,” Said Moss, “Boys, on an errand for their Uncle. Hopefully the Count will find what they tell him interesting enough that he’ll consider meeting us in person.”

“We’re going to meet the count?” asked Sila, both excited and a little worried, “Oh no, I left my feast day dress at home, and I can’t wear this to meet him,” she said, worrying over her faded linen dress.

Pell seemed to have a similar concern, and looked to Moss, wide-eyed, “It will be fine, I know a tailor in town. She’ll be more than willing to get you some proper clothes to meet the Count, and she’ll let us pay her back afterwards.”

This did not seem to put their concerns entirely to rest, but they did relax a little. Sila and Pell were definitely out of their comfort zone. Not only were they many dozens of miles further from home than they’d ever been, but they were –hopefully- going to meet what they probably considered to be a higher class of person.

*There aren’t six million people in all of Rhona, maybe not even all of Elardia. There’s no way in hell I’d be this awestruck upon meeting the mayor of Toronto.*

“Planning on leaving today then Quinn?” asked Pell.

“Yeah, I need to get on my way. I should be in Myra by noon tomorrow, and from there I’ll have about a week to find a ship to Nimre.”

“What if you don’t find one?” Asked Sila, seeming a little conflicted.

“Well I could risk staying, waiting longer to find a ship. But if I can’t find a ship then I need to walk to Nimre, and every day I do stay cuts into time I’ve set aside for resting along the way. It’s a gamble, so hopefully I find something in the first week.”

“You remember what I said before Quinn?” Asked Moss.

“About the sort of ship to look for? Yeah, captains running ships for large merchant families. I was thinking that I’d try to find one running perishable goods, something that doesn’t keep too long.”

Moss raised his eyebrows at this, and I elaborated, “I don’t really want to be on a ship that stops in Adympia. So I figure I find a ship that’s either not going to stop until it arrives at its destination, or one that’s not going to be stopping for very long. That probably means a ship running perishable goods, or possibly mail.”

Moss nodded approvingly, “That’s quite a good plan. Mail carriers work for the crown, but they’re in much the same situation as the merchant captains. They’re paid by the mile, and less even than the merchants are. They’ll also have even more space than the merchants will. You should have better luck finding a mail carrier than a cargo ship. It’s still early in the year yet for shipping, but that just means that there’s going to be a lot of mail that needs to get on its way.”

We chatted for a little longer as we ate our meals, and then it came time to say our goodbyes. Sort of like the crying thing, I have a hard time with goodbyes. I’m perfectly content to say “Goodbye,” and then get the hell on my way. Other people though seem to get a little emotional, and it can take forever to finally get out the door without offending anyone. I resolved to get this over with as quickly as possible.

I waved over the, *wench? I’m going with wench,* and paid for my room and board, leaving a decent tip. I’m pretty sure elves tipped, so I tipped.

I stood, extending a hand towards Moss, “Well, I appreciate all the advice you’ve given me Moss.”

He seemed a little surprised at how abruptly I was leaving, but he shook, “We’ll be sad to see you go.”

I extended my hand to Pell, “Thanks for giving me a place to work while I was in Essens.”

He shook as well, “You helped me far more than I helped you Quinn, not just the forge, but this as well,” he said, gesturing towards the Aluminum jewellery and trinkets still on the table.

“You’re quite welcome,” and I extended my hand to Sila, “Goodbye Sila.”

She took my hand, “Goodbye Quinn.”

I raised a hand in farewell, and I left the inn.

-----

As soon as I heard the door close behind me I let out a breath that I hadn’t realized I’d been holding. It wasn’t that I disliked the people I’d spent the last several months with, and I had no idea how I felt about Sila, but I was still glad to be leaving.

Then I heard the door open behind me, and I turned to see Sila running out.

*Oh for fuck’s sake.*

She ran right into me, and wrapped her arms around me, “You will come back won’t you?” She asked.

*Nope.*

“Maybe? I don’t know how much free time I’ll have once I’ve started classes. Probably once my studies are done.”

“Well, I supposed that’s going to have to be good enough then,” she said, her voice muffled by my sweater.

I felt rather awkward, it was still early morning which meant that there weren’t many people around, but I still felt very self-conscious at the public display of affection. I sort of patted her on the shoulder, waiting for her to let go of me, and she finally stepped back. Her eyes were a little red, but she wasn’t quite crying.

“Bye Quinn.”

“Bye Sila.”

And I left, without looking back.

# Chapter 12

Without the others along I covered the distance to Myra quite a lot faster than I would have otherwise. Aside from just being able to walk more quickly, I was also carrying a lot less weight. Not only had I left the aluminum I’d been carrying with Pell, but I also didn’t need to carry as much food and water since I’d be stopping in villages and towns for lunch, rather than bringing along the food to eat on the road. I also hadn’t yet replaced my ruined pemmican, and I decided to wait until I reached Myra to try to find something suitable. After all, if I found a ship I probably wasn’t going to need it quite as much.

The journey to Myra passed rather uneventfully, and it was near noon on the second day alone when I crested a hill, coming into sight of the city. Myra was clearly quite a lot larger than Colos was, Sila had mentioned that Colos had something like ten thousand people, Myra must have had nearer one hundred thousand. From my vantage point on the hill I could see that the city covered about four times as much area, and the buildings within seemed both larger, and more densely packed. The walls were also proper stone, rather than a simple wooden palisade like Colos had. They were quite high, maybe fifty feet tall.

*I guess that they’d have a much easier time shipping in stone since they’re right on the water. Colos would need to drag it nearly ninety miles inland, or quarry it basically on site.*

The city did not have much of a harbour to work with, and instead I could see long wharfs extending out into the sea. *Unless it’s an ocean.* With the sailing ships tied up alongside. Seeing the ships reinforced my belief that the local level of technological development was about Greco-Roman. *TL2* All of the ships appeared to be galleys of some sort, like ancient Greek triremes, though some had two or four sails instead of three. *Biremes and quadriremes I think?* I could see one major difference though, between the ships out in the sea and the Greek equivalents. None of the ships I could see seemed to have oars, and were relying instead only on wind power. Human made triremes had two or even sometimes three banks of rowers, but I couldn’t see anything like that out in the bay.

*I guess rowing isn’t really an option for a race that has such limited endurance.*

I pulled out my waterproof notebook, and added ‘Steam Ships’ to my list of things to introduce under my ‘Steam Power’ heading.

As I continued down the hard packed dirt road I realized that there was a gaping hole in my plan. I had no idea how much it was going to cost to hitch a ride on a ship. This was the sort of thing that might be rather expensive. If it wasn’t expensive then everyone would get around by ship, especially since elves seemed to have a very hard time covering distances on foot. I might be able to find a ship, but not afford it. On the other hand, it might not be expensive at all. If some captain is trying to make some drachm on the side and doesn’t have a bunch of people clamouring for a spot, he might not ask for much at all, especially if it’s not his ship and he’s not paying for the supplies I’d be using during the voyage.

Well the first step would be to get in the front gate, which might be a problem for me. When I’d stopped at the villages on my way to Myra I hadn’t had things thrown at me or been spit on, but it was clear that I made people uneasy. From what I’d gleaned from the few books I’d read and what I heard from Moss, I was about the height of a tall Orc, or a short Giant. I was slimmer than either since I favoured cardio over strength training, but I was still more thickly built than any elf I’d seen other than Pell. While the nobles I’d met in Colos had been somewhat more relaxed, they were a bit more worldly than common folk, and they might have been slightly drunk at the time. The common folk I’d met on the other hand were much like the people I’d met in Essens, they hadn’t been more than a couple dozen miles from home. Worse than that, while the elves in the valley were insulated from most strife by the mountains, these people had to deal with the realities of life in an early-medieval village. This meant that they lacked the innocence that the elves in the valley had. Harp had seen me as an odd but otherwise harmless curiosity, while the innkeepers I met outside of the valley seemed to see me as a potential threat, especially since I was no longer accompanied by other elves.

I’d placed the dagger and hatchet in my pack before coming down from the hill, though I still had my folding knife in my pocket if I really needed a weapon. It wasn’t great, since it lacked a hilt, and I also didn’t want to start a fight with some city guards, but it was better than nothing.

The gate I approached was not particularly busy, so the guards there noticed me when I was still a fair ways off. I could see the four of them huddle together in conversation, then one of them ran off around the inside of the wall.

*Uh oh.*

The fourth one returned just before I got there, bringing a fifth elf, this one looked to be the one in charge. The other four all had rather simple uniforms, and the word uniform could be used loosely. The first four all seemed to be wearing what were basically their everyday work clothes, not that different from what Harp wore when working at his tavern, but had a yellow cloak worn over this. The newcomer was dressed similarly, though his clothes seemed to be somewhat nicer, and his cloak was orange. I didn’t know a whole lot about the colours of medieval dyes, Dwarf Fortress didn’t go into much detail there, but I did an inventory of myself to check if I was wearing any colours I should be wearing, or shouldn’t have access to.

*Jeans, very dark blue-black, probably okay? Sila had that blue feast day dress. Hoodie, also very dark blue, also probably fine. Shirt, burgundy, I left the blue one in my bag. Does burgundy count as purple? Am I not supposed to wear purple?*

As I approached I finally got a close look at Agent Orange, he was probably the first elf I’d met that actually looked older than thirty. If he was a human I’d guess that he was in his mid-forties, but for all I knew, this guy might be two hundred. The yellow cloaked guards on the other hand could have been anywhere from twenty to one hundred and twenty. I was guessing that they were a little on the young side though. They were all standing rather close together, and while they weren’t quite frightened of the giant stranger, they also didn’t want to face him alone.

Agent Orange waved me over as I neared the gate, and I stopped in front of him.

“Hello,” I said.

“Hello there, I’m Sergeant Cuselo,” he said, introducing himself and extending a hand.

“I’m Quinn,” I said, shaking the offered hand.

“I’ve not seen you here before, you new to the city?”

“Yeah, I’m new, just passing through.”

“Oh yeah, where are you going?” He asked, in the too friendly voice that cops like to use when trying to interrogate someone while making it seem like a friendly conversation.

“Nimre,” I said, slightly irritated, but trying not to let it show. If this guard was anything like cops I’d met, then he’d start to get all pissy if it seemed like I wasn’t absolutely thrilled to be speaking with him.

“Oh yeah, when do you think you’ll be leaving?” He asked, continuing with the ‘friendly’ voice.

*And there’s the question, however…*

“I’m not sure, I might be here for a while,” I said, and I could see from his expression that he didn’t like this idea at all, “Unless of course I can find a ship that’s headed the right way. I can’t cover the distance on foot, so I need to find a ship as soon as possible. Would you know if there’s a tavern that caters to captains or officers? I might ask around there to see if I can find passage.”

Agent Orange, or Cuselo rather, seized upon the solution offered to him, “Ah yeah, down near the docks is an inn called The Anchor Chain. I’m sure if you look around there you can find a ship heading for Nimre.”

*Upside, I know where to go, downside, he knows where I’ll be.*

“Thank you very much,” *asshole*, “I appreciate all the help,” I said, as I headed into town to find The Anchor Chain.

*I guess no one cares about burgundy.*

-----

The Anchor Chain was not too hard to find, and I got in a little after lunchtime. Thankfully they weren’t done serving food, and I got myself a nice big bass for lunch. Aside from some of the venison I’d tried as I was making myself the pemmican over a month ago, this was the first time I’d had proper food since arriving in the valley. And damn it was good, little bit of olive oil, little bit of lemon, and some green stuff that I was sure was some sort of herb or spice, it was delicious. This was after all, a fairly nice place. Most places it was just the one drachm and that covered room and board for a night, here it was three drachm just for the meal, and it would be seven more for dinner and a room tonight. It was definitely expensive, especially after a rather generous tip, but I figured it was worth it. Aside from finally satiating my hunger for formerly living creatures, I really did not want to be trekking across most of a continent on foot. If seven drachm a night was what it took to find a ship, then I was happy to spend the money. Catering to wealthier customers also meant that I’d probably make more gambling, so I was fairly sure that I’d be able to at least break even if I stayed here all week.

The rest of the inn matched the quality of the food. The tables and chairs where patrons sat to eat were functional, but still featured some fancy scrollwork and were stained a rich dark brown. The innkeeper and the serving girls were also better dressed and better spoken than what I’d been used to while traveling here. There was even a nice sitting area near the fire with some nice upholstered chairs where patrons could sit and relax.

One of the serving girls came over to take away my plate, and I tried not to let her notice quite the way I was looking at her.

I remembered Sila mentioning that some of the elves in the city claimed to be of a different sort than the elves in the villages, and I’d originally chalked this up to some lower class versus upper class snobbery, though I’d noticed some details while passing through the city. There were clear differences to be seen between the village elves, *wood elves I guess?*, and city elves, *high elves maybe?* They were both roughly the same height, and the city elves were still rather slim, but they were proportioned rather more generously than the wood elves. This was something I had noticed around the serving girl’s hips and chest, and she was definitely not someone that I’d mistake for a child. The colouration was another clear difference, though it wasn’t as stark as the difference between some humans. The wood elves weren’t really dark skinned, they were still somewhat fair, but somehow ‘earthy’ seemed like a rather good adjective to use. The variety of hair and eye colours I saw followed this theme, their hair and eyes were generally some shade of brown, though there was the odd wood elf like Moss that had green hair or green eyes.

The city elves on the other hand, calling them high elves felt wrong, were pale and had much more variety in hair and eye colour. I saw some almost metallic seeming shades, copper, which was my personal favourite, various shades of silver, and there were even some with steel-like grey hair. I didn’t see anyone with gold-like blonde hair, though that may have simply been due to my limited sample size. Eye colour was what I found most interesting though, there were the greens and blues, but there were also some elves with purple, lavender, yellow, or orange eyes. The particular girl that had been serving me had long pale silver hair, up in a bun, and lavender eyes. I found the combination rather stunning, especially with her huge elfin eyes. The clothes certainly helped the impression, she was wearing a light pink dress, laced tightly up the back. It was especially tight around the waist, and between the resulting hourglass shape and her sharply attractive features it took some work not to stare.

*Whoa there Quinn, down boy.*  

“How was everything?” She asked politely.

“It was fantastic, thank you very much,” I responded equally politely, “I did have a question though.”

“Oh, is there something else I can get for you?”

“I’m looking to make my way to Nimre, you must know an awful lot about what goes on here,” I said, seeing how flattery did when combined with the nice tip, “Do you know if any of the captains here are headed that way? I’m looking to hop a ship to Nimre, and I certainly don’t want to try crossing Adympia to get there.”

“Oh no,” she said, voice getting a little higher, “You’re right, even if you had the right papers to travel, you might end up in trouble. Any Adympian house would pay a lot of money to add someone as special as you to their collection.”

“Someone as special as me you say?” I asked raising my eyebrows, serious expression on my face.

She narrowed her eyes a little, “I simply meant that you’re unique.”

“Of course, I didn’t mean to suggest that you meant anything different,” I said in a lazy tone.

She smiled a little, biting the corner of her lower lip, “There’s some ships headed that way, are you going to be staying here for dinner? I can point them out to you then if you like.”

“Just hold on a second, now you’re asking me to stay for dinner?” I asked, enjoying the game, “And you’re holding hostage my only chance to avoid a possible life of slavery. I can’t believe you, taking advantage of an innocent traveler like this, it’s just awful.”

She pursed her lips, “Are you staying for dinner or not,” she asked, tone a little cocky.

“Well I suppose I have no choice now,” I said, feigning resignation.

“I’ll just put this away,” she said, picking up my plate,” and we can get you a room so you can put away your things,” nodding at the bag next to my chair.

*Careful Quinn, manage your expectations.*

-----

Once she’d put away my dishes she showed me upstairs, and a question came to mind.

“I don’t suppose you have any rooms that are built for someone my size?” I asked, dreading another night crumpled up in a tiny bed.

“Oh we do,” she said excitedly, “There are a few Giant clans that send down ships to trade, and sometimes they stay here. There should be plenty of space for you in one of the Giant rooms.”

“That sounds perfect,” I said, relieved. I was pretty sure that the average giant was around seven feet tall, so I’d have more than enough space to stretch out.

“Here,” she said, opening a door at the end of the hall, one of two that was taller than any of the others in the hallway.

I looked around, and the room seemed perfect. I didn’t even need to duck under the doorway, the bed was probably eight feet long and nearly as wide, and all the furniture seemed large enough that I wouldn’t feel like I was about to break something if I took a seat at the desk. There was even a fireplace set into one wall, with a few chairs like those downstairs set around it.

She was looking up at me, with a smile on her face, “I guess you like it then.”

“Imagine spending three and a half months sleeping in beds that are only four feet long. This is fantastic, thank you very much,” I said gratefully.

“Well let me know if there’s anything else you need, I’ll let you wash up. There’s a bathroom right through there,” she said, pointing to a door on one wall of the room, “And if there’s any clothes you want washed just put them in there,” and she pointed to a basket just inside the door.

“Oh,” I said, just as she was about to leave, “I’m Quinn by the way.”

“Thera,” She said, extending a hand, and I shook it.

She thumped me on the chest, “Now go take a bath, you smell all sweaty,” and she was out the door before I could retort.

-----

I set down my pack on the desk after she left, and then inspected the bathroom. Aside from everything being made of brass or copper rather than porcelain or plastic, it looked very much like a modern bathroom. *I guess I was right about the sanitation thing. And judging from the lack of smell on most people, they must also bathe regularly.* I ran the bath and stripped out of my clothes, throwing them into the basket. I had modern spares for everything except the jeans, and I’d gotten myself a pair of linen trousers before leaving Essens, so I set those out instead. They were all in good shape too, I’d not worn them since leaving Essens, and they’d also gotten a good rinsing after my bath in the river.

Oh god, the bath felt amazing. Not only was it fantastically hot, almost too hot, **but the tub was big enough for me!** I hadn’t even had that luxury on Earth, I’d always have to sit with my knees pulled up out of the water. But here I could lay back and stretch my legs out in front of me, it felt fantastic on my aching muscles.

-----

I lay there in the bath for nearly an hour, and even then, I had to spend some time thinking about it before I finally decided that I did in fact need to get up and get dressed. I saw that my laundry had already been taken away, and I dressed in my second set of clothes. I pulled my jacket out of my bag, the hoodie having gone with the laundry, and I shrugged into it as I headed downstairs. Thera was busy with another customer when I came down into the common room, but she noticed me out of the corner of her eye as I was heading out into the city and gave me a little wave goodbye as I left.

-----

I wanted to see more of the city, but I also had some errands to run. The first thing I wanted to do was try to sell some of my aluminum dice, I had three sets, and I really only needed one to play. I looked around for a bit, not sure where the best place to sell the dice would be. Maybe a jeweller? They might melt down the aluminum and use the material in something else. Or maybe a shop selling expensive curiosities? They might resell the dice as is to some wealthy noble who wanted something to impress his gambling friends. Well, I had two sets of dice to sell, so I resolved to check on both options. First would be the jeweller, mostly because it was much easier to find than the alternative.

I looked for one that was fancy, but not so fancy that they wouldn’t bother reselling interesting pieces. I had heard Victorian era stories where down on their luck families would sell family heirlooms or some jewellery to make ends meet, and I figured that Myra couldn’t be much different. In fact, Victorian seemed like a pretty good approximation of what I saw. While the level of technology was definitely Greco-Roman, there seemed to be a fondness for corsets among the upper class women. *Thera’s dress is likely designed to mimic the style of a corset, without being so expensive or hard to move in.* It wasn’t taken to quite the extreme that Victorian era clothing was though, which was probably due to the Mediterranean climate. There we no large hoop dresses and no one seemed to dress in layers like was common in Victorian London, it was too warm already for that sort of thing, and it was still early spring.

I ducked into a jeweller’s that looked promising, and waited patiently while the only other customer in the shop was served. I had initially been unsure if I was dressed suitably for somewhere so fancy, but I thought that I might be okay. My clothes were foreign enough that I hoped that no one would recognize the more casual cut, and I guessed that the colours would help sell the idea that I belonged in such a nice store. It took a lot of work to ‘fix’ natural dyes so that they didn’t fade, and even then getting a consistent colour across the whole garment was hard, and there would be a little variation. Made with modern techniques my shirt and coat must have looked like they’d just been freshly dyed, and with the highest quality colours available.

My hypothesis was confirmed once the proprietor finally got done with the other customer. He looked me over once he’d finished with the man he’d been serving, and I got the sense that he’d mentally categorized me under ‘foreign, but wealthy’. This worked for me, and I decided to play along.

“Good afternoon my Goodman,” he greeted me, making ‘good man’ sound like a form of address, like ‘Mister’ or ‘Sir’, “What may I help you with?”

I withdrew one set of the dice from my pocket, and set them on the counter between us, “Do you know what metal this is made of?” I asked, nodding towards the dice.

He reached for one of the dice, “Ah, may I?”

“Certainly.”

He picked up the die, feeling the weight, “Why, this must be nearly pure aluminum,” he said, as he looked to me, seeming surprised.

“It is in fact pure aluminum.”

“This is quite the impressive piece of work, but why are you showing it to me?”

“I’m given to understand that this is the sort of place that might pay for such goods?” I asked, and he nodded, ”Well I simply must get to Nimre, I’ve meetings to keep in the city. Unfortunately it seems that your elfin captains and merchants are fairly picky, and they don’t want to take Canadian coin. I only have so many drachm to hand, but I was told that elves hold this metal in high esteem. I would be grateful if you might help resolve these issues so that my expedition might continue,” I did my best to give the impression of a merchant with much to do, and little time to do it. I didn’t think I was that good an actor, but between my foreignness and the fact that I was about to let him pay me half what the dice were worth I don’t think he noticed the trick.

“Oh certainly,” he said excitedly, seeing the opportunity. *A foreigner with no idea of the true value of his goods, fantastic!* “Just let me get my scales.”

He moved over to a cabinet set into the back wall, and drew out a set of merchant’s scales. He held them out, no weight on them, to show that they were fairly balanced. I nodded for him to continue, and he set to work weighing out the dice. He made a show of humming and hawing over a decision, before he finally spoke.

“I can offer you, perhaps, 200 drachm per die,” he said, purposefully.

I said nothing, but instead frowned in thought. This was actually about double what I’d expected to get for them, either he wasn’t cheating me, or aluminum was worth even more than I thought it was.

“Ah, perhaps 250?” he said, a little less certain.

I could probably push it further, but if I could get rid of all the dice now then I might as well. I drew out the rest of the dice, including the set that I was originally going to keep.

“Would you pay as much for all nine of the dice? I’d rather not have to look elsewhere to be rid of the rest, but I understand if such a transaction would be beyond your means.” *Threaten him with competition, and then insult him, but only a little. Just enough to get him to rise to the challenge.*

“Oh by no means,” he said, puffing out his chest and straightening up, “I can certainly handle everything here, no sense in looking around for ages trying to find another merchant that won’t cheat you. Just give me a moment,” and he retreated into a back room, hopefully to get my payment.

*Well, there’s money solved for a while.*

He counted out 2250 drachm onto the counter between us, most of the coins being silver in various sizes, rather than the normal 1 drachm copper pieces. I gathered up the coins, and thanked him for his help before I left on my second errand.

My second errand was straightforward, and hopefully made much easier by my newfound wealth. *I’ve got what, more than three years’ salary for the average person in my pocket right now?* I was going to see if I could find some new spellbooks.

-----

It was an hour after dark before I’d finally gotten back to the tavern, and I’d probably been through every bookstore and curio shop in the whole city. In that time I’d found only two items of note. The first was a book that claimed to teach three spells, Light, Sound, and Basic Illusion. It was titled, rather lamely 'Basic Illusion Magic', by Amus Beraha. Light I already knew, but that wasn’t necessarily a bad thing. If I didn’t have a way to verify the authenticity of the book I might have assumed it to be a fake and left it behind. Detect Magic didn’t seem to detect spellbooks as magical, so instead I looked over the section on Light. The symbols in this book matched up with what I’d memorized, and I went ahead and paid the 150 drachm to get my new spellbook.

The second item of note was a ring, which the owner of the shop claimed was studded with three ‘powerstones’. To me they looked like tiny chips of some brownish quartz like mineral, but Detect Magic seemed to think that the ring was in fact magical. More than that, it told me that the type of magic used was ‘Enchantment’. Supposedly the two smaller stones each stored 1 mana, and the larger central stone stored 2 mana. I wasn’t terribly interested in the two 1 mana stones, since I seemingly already had one mana at an infinitely high recovery rate, but the 2 mana stone might let me cast the more mana-intensive forms of the spells I knew. It was expensive, 300 drachm, but I wasn’t about to let an honest to god magical ring pass me by. Even if it did look like the sort of jewellery you might buy from a push cart at the local mall.

Thera looked up as I walked in, she was sitting behind the bar with her chin propped up in one hand, reading a book. The rest of the patrons hadn’t yet gone to bed, but most of them already had their drinks and had settled in. Some were gambling, some were playing Zatrikion, and others were chatting by the fire. I walked up to the bar and sat on a stool across from her.

“You’re back late, I was worried that you might have gotten into trouble with some guards,” she said, closing her book.

“You were worried about me? Aww, how sweet,” I said, leaning forwards onto the bar.

She rolled her eyes, “Want something to eat?” She asked, standing up.

“Yes please.”

She took out a pair of bass fillets that had been staying warm in the wood stove, and she put each on a plate with some assorted veggies. I watched her as she got dinner ready for, well the two of us I suppose, and I decided that I rather liked the look of her bending over to reach into the stove. She set a plate and some cutlery in front of each of us, and I raised an eyebrow as she sat across from me to eat.

“Well I did ask you to stay for dinner,” she said quietly.

We chatted a little as we ate in the quiet common room, lit by the light from the fireplace and the oil lamps hung on the wall. She asked me what it was like where I was from, she seemed to take the fact that I’d been dropped off by a Banestorm for granted, and I asked her about life here in Myra. It was rather casual conversation, there we no ground-breaking revelations, though I noticed that she seemed to go out of her way to mention in passing that “even different sorts of goblinoids” can’t produce offspring.

*I feel like she might be trying to tell me something.*

We sat there talking for long enough that most people had filed out of the inn, or gone to bed. The only people still in the common room aside from the two of us were the ones seated in the comfy chairs around the fire, engrossed in their own conversation. Even the innkeeper had said goodnight to the two of us before retiring for the night.

“I thought you were going to point out some captains to me?” I said, false accusation in my voice.

“Ah, something must have distracted me,” she said, not looking up at me, “tomorrow night, promise.”

I had no idea what to say next, we were quickly approaching territory almost entirely unknown to me, and I filled time by taking a drink of the tea that Thera had made for us after we’d finished our meal.

Thera apparently had no such reservations. She leaned forwards and put her hand on my shoulder, pulling my face towards hers. I thought for a second that she was about to kiss me, but no such luck. Instead she sniffed at my neck, “You’re all smelly again,” she said, looking up into my eyes challengingly.

I felt a tightness in my chest, and, other places, “Well I was walking around all day, being a tourist is hard work.”

“Go upstairs, take a bath, I’ll be up once I’ve finished for the night,” and before I had a chance to either agree or object, she pushed me back into my seat and slipped off her stool, ducking into a back room.

*Damn. This has gone well.*

-----

I did as… *commanded?* and went up to my room to wash up for the night. I took my time, and gave my face a onceover with the razor, banishing my five o’clock shadow. There was a freshly laundered robe hanging from a hook on the door, and I shrugged into it, tying it loosely before opening the door to the bathroom.

Thera was sitting on the bed, waiting. She’d let her hair down, and it fell in a messy tangle, framing her face She’d put out most of the lights, and the room was lit only by the flickering light of the fireplace.

“Mmmmm,” she murmured, biting her lip and looking at my chest, which was not quite hidden by the linen robe, “Now come unwrap me,” in a quiet voice that was half command, half beg.

“Turn around,” I said softly, as I approached her.

She stood up from the bed, and turned around, pulling her hair to one side.

I found where the laces were tied at her lower back. The dress was done up very tightly, and she let out a contented sigh when I pulled the knot apart. I took my sweet time loosening the rest of the laces, and I was rewarded with more rather intriguing sounds of pleasure for my trouble. I finally loosened it enough for her to free herself, and she wriggled free of the dress. The dress had been tight enough to leave marks, and I could clearly see where the seam had run down her side, and more marks ran up her spine, left there by the laces. I was gentle, doing my best to massage the sore spots. It must have worked, judging from the sounds she was making, and I could feel her relaxing. Finally she arched her back, letting out a shuddering breath.

“Enough,” she said forcefully, voice husky.

She turned, and grabbed at the robe with both fists, and she threw me bodily onto the bed in a display of elfin strength. She straddled me, and I ran one hand down her thigh, running my eyes over her. She looked just as amazing naked as she had in that dress. She was petite like Sila had been, but where Sila had been flat chested with narrow hips, Thera was a bombshell with wide hips and a quite ample bust. Her lips were slightly parted, and her eyes were hungry as she pulled at the belt that tied my robe. I put my hands on her waist, as she finally pulled away what little covering I had. She lifted herself up to mount me but instead I rolled over, pinning her to the bed underneath me, using my greater weight to counter her strength. She let out a primal growl, and tried to pull me into her with her legs, but I held myself off of her, mostly. I rolled my hips, teasing at her opening, as I leaned down to kiss her. She met my mouth hungrily, and I could hear her growl in the back of her throat as she tried to wrap herself around me.

“You seem a little pent up Thera,” I teased, still not quite letting myself all the way down onto her.

She tried to say something, probably unkind, but I pressed my lips down onto hers and whatever she was going to say was muffled by the kiss as she growled at me.

I was probably even more pent up than she was, but I am a definite believer in deferred gratification. I took my time, teasing her, running a hand over her chest and teasing at her nipples. I knew that she’d tire out eventually, all I had to do was keep control of her until she did.

Finally I felt the strength drain away, she was stronger, but just couldn’t keep it up for very long. Then the commanding growls turned into pleading whimpers, and I finally let her have what she wanted. She shuddered, letting out a moan.

“I am so going to make you pay for this,” she gasped out, with the rhythm of our bodies.

Exhausted like she was, she was putty in my arms. She barely had the strength to wrap her legs around my waist and hold on. The height difference made it awkward to kiss her at the same time, and instead she settled for licking and kissing at my chest. Even in this I did my best to torment her, bringing her close, but not quite pushing her over the edge. I took a sick pleasure in having such a degree of control over her, making her beg me to do more to her, and I let it last as long as I could.

“Oh please god, just--- AIIIHHHHHHhhhhh,” she clamped a hand over her mouth and her legs tightened around my waist.

Her eyes got wide and watery and I heard her muffle a high pitched moan. That set me off almost immediately, and I stifled a growl as I held her down roughly and saw to my own needs.

She went limp as I finished, her arms and legs sprawled on the bed. I rolled off of her, and I could see that she had same watery eyed, open mouthed expression on her face as she lay there gasping. We both just lay there in the big bed, exhausted and breathing hard, enjoying the afterglow. She rolled over weakly, and pulled her face into to my side with arm thrown across my chest, and we fell asleep just like that.


# Chapter 13

I woke up feeling amazing. I was comfortable, relaxed, and I felt truly satisfied for the first time in ages. It was very early in the morning, and while I could hear the odd bird chirping outside, the sky was still dark. The fire had burned down to coals and a cool breeze blew in through the open window. Thera was still curled up next to me, her head resting on my shoulder with one arm thrown across my chest. I slid out from under her as carefully as possible, trying not to disturb her. The blankets slipped down her back as she settled into the depression I’d left in the bed, and I stood there for a moment admiring the look of her as she lay sprawled on her side, I was glad to see that the marks left by the tight dress had faded. I was getting a little chilly, standing there naked, and I padded over to the bathroom to answer nature’s call. I’d just washed up in the basin, when I heard the bed creak as if someone was moving around. When I came back into the room Thera was kneeling on the bed with the blankets drawn up around herself. Even with all the blankets I could see that she was shivering visibly, and I recalled that Sila and the other elves I’d met had more difficulty with cold than I did.

“Did I say-y you could l-leave?” She asked, chattering teeth ruining her attempt at a commanding tone.

I pushed Thera onto her back, and I got a hungry grin from her for my trouble, despite her shivering. I lay down beside her and pulled her in close. She was really cold, and I felt a little bad for leaving her uncovered after I’d finished admiring her. Though admiring was possibly too modest a word for what I’d been doing. She pulled the blankets up over her head, and I wrapped my arms around as she shivered. It took a few minutes, but she finally stopped shaking. She shifted around, pressing her back to my chest and poking her head out of the blankets, her cheek resting on my elbow.

“I think this is what it would feel like if I was sitting with my back against the side of the stove,” she murmured quietly, still a little sleepy, “Are all humans this warm?”

I smiled, “More or less, though human men are usually a bit warmer than human women,” I replied, as I dragged the fingers of my free hand lightly over her bare stomach.

“Oh, and how do I compare to a human woman?” She asked, in a dangerous tone.

“Mmm, you’re a little shorter, though the rest of you more than makes up for it,” I said, sliding my fingers up to tease at one nipple. She didn’t seem to mind too much, “What about me? How do I compare to an elf man?”

 “Ahh, you’re a little taller I guess,” she said, hunching her shoulders a little and turning pink. That was the first time I’d seen her blush at all, up till now she had seemed pretty comfortable with her sexuality.

“Hmm? I feel like there’s more you’re not telling me,” I taunted.

“Well I’ve never been with another elf before,” she said a little shyly.

*Uh oh*

“It’s not like that,” she said, feeling me tense up, “But what would you think would happen if I did take another elf to bed? I can’t have a child, I have a life to live. All the saving I’ve been doing is no good if some grubby man puts a baby in me. My parents would probably force me to marry him and I’m not going to spend the rest of my life barefoot and pregnant for some minor merchant. Once I have enough money I’m going to hop a ship to Nimre, just like you are, and learn the skills I need to support myself.”

I blinked, *Grubby? And she’s a Mage?*

“What?” She asked, turning awkwardly to look at me.

“Well,” I said hesitantly, not sure quite where to start. *Let’s start small,* ”Grubby?”

“Usually means not clean or dirty?” she said, a little sarcastically. She turned away from me again, snuggling in close. She grabbed my hand, which I’d let fall to the covers after being distracted by her remarks, and she held it to her chest. “Even when you were fresh from the road you didn’t smell too bad, and you actually washed properly when I asked you to, which I appreciate,” she said, sniffing at my hand.

“Do elves not bathe regularly?”

“Well yeah, just not regularly enough for my tastes. Mother says I shouldn’t be so prissy, but I have a hard time getting over the smell. I don’t think Mother knows quite why I’m so uptight about cleanliness though,” she said, pulling my hand up to her mouth, sucking lightly at each of my fingers in turn. “Most elves aren’t like me though, but most gnomes are thankfully, maybe a little gnome has rubbed off on me,” she said, giggling at her own dirty joke.

“Gnomes? The little green guys?” I asked, a little wryly.

“Don’t laugh,” she said sternly, “what else is there? Orcs are all raving lunatics, Giants are big and smelly and never wash, never ever. Another elf might just ruin my life if I’m unlucky, and dwarves aren’t around a whole lot. Gnomes come sometimes though,” and she giggled again.

“I bet they do.”

“I think you might have ruined me though,” she said, grimacing and crossing her legs, one hand on her lower abdomen.

“Did I…” I trailed off, not sure if I should feel bad or be **extremely** pleased with myself.

She elbowed me in the stomach, “Oh look at me,” she said, in a deep voice that I’m sure was supposed to mimic mine, “The big strong human, I’ve got such a big cock that when I have my way with a tiny little elf woman she breaks right in half.”

“That is… not what I was thinking.” I said, smiling widely.

*That is exactly was I was thinking.*

“I do feel rather sore down there though,” she said, and I could see her smirking a little, “I don’t think I’m going to find gnomes quite as satisfying as I did before you came along.”

“Why go through the trouble though? I mean, not to be indelicate, though I feel like we’re well past indelicate,” she did after all, have my middle finger all the way in her mouth, and I had an idea of where it would be going next, “But aren’t your parents still going to be royally pissed off if they find out you’ve been with anyone, whether it could get you pregnant or not?”

My finger came out of her mouth with a ‘pop’, “Yeah, but a girl has got to take care of herself. It’s no good to get all pent up and then let some boy put his hands all over you in a moment of weakness. Then you have to go to a special home for ‘women in a similar situation’. Nobles do the same thing when they can, both the men and the women, whole Adympian families make their business selling unique ‘toys’ to the very wealthy."

I stiffened a little at that, and not in an interesting fun time way.

She tilted her head to look up at me, “You hadn’t really considered it like that had you? I mean it’s not like that’s the only reason that Admypia likes slaves that come from Banestorms, but it’s definitely one of the reasons.”

“What, else, do they usually have slaves like that," *or me* "do?”

“Well I’ve never been to Admypia,” she said quietly, “but from what I’ve heard they do all the normal stuff that they have slaves do. Some are scribes, footmen, they’ll drive coaches, some will cook, though they don’t usually waste Outsiders on the menial tasks like farming or mining,” she said, making Outsider sound like a title or race, “But sometimes, they also make them do, other stuff…”

I suddenly had a better understanding of the sorts of sexual harassment scandals that I’d hear on the news. If you couldn’t find a willing partner, hard enough in a place with old world values, it often meant victimizing someone else to satisfy your own needs. These people didn’t even have the internet as an outlet. Now imagine the same scandal, except the sick old man in question has total control over the life of the young woman he’s victimizing, and knows that there will be no consequences for his actions. *A young woman like Thera… or Sila.* Though judging from what Thera said, I wasn’t immune to such exploitation either. Even here in Rhona, life must not be terribly great for women. A woman didn’t need to be a slave for some powerful noble to decide that the maid was going to take on ‘extra’ duties. And what would she do? If she turned down the advances then she might find herself without any other work, especially if the spurned nobleman put in a bad word with his friends. I’d been thinking, rather unfairly, that Thera was kind of vampish. And maybe she was, but I realized that this was her way of maintaining control over herself. The sass, the commanding attitude, making small requests that she expected to be fulfilled like bathing first. I thought that serving at one of the more common taverns might have been the worse job, needing to dodge the groping hands of drunk patrons, but it was probably no better here. The patrons here were probably just a little classier about how they went about things when they decided to satiate their appetites.

*And if life here is so shitty for women, then why the hell are you adding to it Quinn? You dropped Sila like a sack of potatoes as soon as you decided that she had nothing to offer you, even if she wasn’t the one, that could have been handled a hell of a lot more gracefully*

“Hey, what’s wrong?” Thera asked, twisting again to look at me, concern in her huge brown eyes, “Don’t worry Quinn, I’ll find you a ship, I promise.”

“I… I appreciate that, though that’s not what I was thinking about. I think I might have made a terrible mistake, and it’s one that I don’t think I’ll be able fix.”

Thera didn’t seem to know what to make of that, eyes searching mine, still clearly concerned about what was worrying me. After a moment though her expression became hungry, “I know just the thing to cheer you up,” she said, grip tightening on my hand, dragging it down between us.

“Hey- just hold on a secon-,” She kissed me deeply, cutting off my protestations, and I gave her what she wanted.

-----

“You are insatiable,” I said, a little while later. The sky had grown light while the two of us had been preoccupied.

It was a little warmer now, especially since we’d gotten each other pretty worked up, and she lay sprawled across my chest.

“I’m perfectly satiable, I’m just getting as much use out of you as I can before you leave for Nimre.”

“What am I, a piece of meat?” I asked, not sure if I should be insulted or gratified.

“Yeah, I’m only interested in you for your body,” she said, matter-of-factly, though I was pretty sure that she was only teasing.

“So you’re a Mage then?” I asked, wondering if she had any spells that I didn’t

“What? No, why would you think that?” she asked.

“Well you said that you were saving up to go to Nimre, didn’t you?”

“Yeah, but just because I’m going to-” She stopped suddenly, eyes growing wide, “You’re a Mage!”

“Maybe…” I said, lamely, “Why do you say that?”

“Oh come on-” she started to say.

“I did actually, remember? You had to run to the bathroom to rinse off,” I interrupted.

She thumped me hard on the chest with one petite fist, “Oh shut up,” she said, expression angry but holding back a laugh, “As I was saying, you thought I was going to Nimre to learn magic because that’s why you’re going there. I bet you didn’t even know that they taught anything else.”

“No I didn’t, is it the same school that teaches magic and non-magic stuff?”

“No, they’ve just got a lot of schools in Nimre. I mean, there’s schools here to. But if you’re a woman and want to learn something other than how to be a prim and proper wife Nimre is pretty much the only option.”

“Are they more egalitarian about the whole thing?”

She sighed heavily, wrapping her arms around me in a big hug, “Not really. But at least they’ll let me in.”

I stroked her hair, imagining how much worse it must have been for a woman my age to get dropped off in this world.

“I wish I was a Mage like you, then I might have a chance,” she said, seeming a little defeated.

“What do you mean? I imagine that you’ll face a hell of a lot of undeserved opposition, but I don’t think it’s hopeless.”

“Maybe,” she said, seeming a little unconvinced, “It’s just that it would be so much easier if I had magic. Aside from really boring stuff like sewing or baking or whatever else a good little girl is supposed to learn, magic is one of the only things that are seen as proper.”

“I suppose that makes some sense, but… Oh,” I said, realizing. Thera nodded her head a little, *show your work Quinn,* “And if they happen to be really good at it, I mean, really good, then they can do whatever the hell they want, can’t they?”

“Yeah, exactly. I was crushed when I first tried to get a mage stone to light up, and it just stayed dark,” *I know someone else like that, don’t I. Dammit.* “It was worse even, because it turned out that the first stone had already been used. I convinced myself that it was the only reason the stone didn’t light, and then it was even worse when I found a fresh stone.”

“Stones can’t be used more than once?” I asked, *Oh god dammit.*

“No, hold on, how do I know more about magic stuff than you?” She said, a little smug.

“Just answer the question,” I said, hands up in surrender.

“No, once a Mage or a Wizard gets the stone to light up it doesn’t work for anyone else. I spent weeks reading everything I could on them, hoping that there was some way I really was a Mage, but no. No magic for Thera.”

“What if a non-Mage trys to light one up, do you still have the stones?” I asked, I might yet be able to make some amends.

“Just the fresh one, but wouldn’t you already have your own?” she said, seeming confused.

“Yeah, but…” I let out a sigh, “It’s kinda complicated, but there’s someone I think deserves another shot at the whole ‘magic’ thing.”

I think my expression and general awkwardness about the situation might have given something away, but she didn’t push it. Instead she reached across me, going out of her way to shove her breasts in my face, to pick up a bracelet from the nightstand next to the bed.

“Here,” she said, dropping the bracelet into my hands, and propping herself up on my chest with an elbow.

It was the sort of bracelet that forms a single solid band when clasped together. It looked like it was made some simple metal, but plated with silver, though the silver had flaked off in places exposing the base metal underneath. At the bracelet’s centre was a single blue stone. Like my own mage stone this one looked initially like it was a piece of glass, though clearer than any of the glass I’d seen in use so far.

“It’s blue,” I said.

Thera looked at me like I was an idiot, “And?”

“I-“ I stammered out, and sighed. I reached over to where I’d left my rings, watch, and coin pouch, to grab the aluminum ring that held my own mage stone.

*I really hope my coin pouch isn’t any lighter now, than when I went to bed.*

“This one is mine,” I said, showing it to her, ”You’ll notice, it’s not blue.”

“Neither was the other one I had, it was green. From what I’ve read the colour doesn’t mean anything special. But, um…” she trailed off, looking at the bracelet I held in one hand.

“This thing is expensive.”

“Yeah,” she said, “I barely got any money back when I sold the first one, and this one was even more expensive.”

“Well, how much then?” I asked, “I’m not just going to ask you to give it to me, so how much do you want for it?”

She looked at me, mouth open slightly, thinking. Quite a few emotions flashed across her huge lavender eyes. I don’t think she could decide if I was serious, or if I was teasing her cruelly. She eventually settled on one emotion, anger.

“Now don’t you think for a second,” she said through gritted teeth, “that I’ll be your little plaything while you’re in Nimre just because you paid for me to be there.”

I think I hit a sore spot, I probably wasn’t the first guy to offer her the money she needed to get to Nimre, though most of them she probably hadn’t already taken to bed.

“Whoa, hold on,” I said soothingly, taking her hands in mine, “I’m going to pay you for the bracelet, I’m not paying you for anything else.”

She looked away from me, but didn’t pull her hands from mine. She finally spoke after a moment, and her voice was hoarse, “It’s just so hard Quinn. If I’d just accepted a tenth the offers I get, I wouldn’t even need to go to Nimre. I could live like a noblewoman right here in Myra if I was willing to whore myself out to horny old men. Having principles sucks.”

I stroked her hair, “I can help a little,” I said, “Let me pay you for the mage stone, it’s not like it’s cheap. I need to find one anyway, might as well get it from you.”

“That’s okay then I guess, who are you sending it to?”

“Uh, oh you know, just a friend of mine,” I said, about as smoothly as the surface of Mars.

“Fine, if you don’t want to tell me then don’t tell me. Why don’t you show me your magic then?”

“I thought I already did?” I said, with a cheesy grin.

She rolled her eyes, letting out a long suffering sigh, “Come on-“

I opened up my mouth to say something, but Thera realized her error and pounced, clamping her hands over my mouth before I could ask where.

“If I let you up, will you be good?” She taunted, straddling my chest.

I raised my hands in surrender, and she uncovered my mouth, though she didn’t get up.

“Are you going to show me or not?” She asked.

“Tonight, before we go to bed.” I answered.

“Tonight? You’re assuming that there will be a tonight,” she taunted, keeping the small smile off her face, “Why wait-“

I raised an eyebrow, and her eyes widened, “Oh, you know **that** kind of magic?” she said, very intrigued by this possibility, “Alright, I suppose that’s worth waiting for.”

She hopped off of me and stood up, stretching one side, then the other.

“Back to work?” I asked.

“No, I don’t need to be back until a bit after noon,” she said, as she bent down to gather up her clothes, “But I’ve got some errands to run before then.”

“Alright, I’ll see you then.”

She dressed, putting on her bracelet as well, and left. As soon as she was out the door I reached over and pulled open my coin pouch. It was, thankfully, still full. *I guess she didn’t really have anywhere to hide it, I did give her a pretty thorough cavity search after all.”

----

I got dressed eventually, after taking a bath. That was not a luxury I was going to have a week from now, whether I got a ship or not, and I intended to make the most of it. I stuffed my new spellbook in the pocket of my hoodie, which had been dropped off with the rest of my laundry just before I got in the bath. I eventually dragged myself downstairs to get something to eat for breakfast. None of the cooks seemed to know what pancakes were, and I resolved to teach the recipe to Thera. There was however, bacon, eggs, sausages, and fresh fruit, so it wasn’t all bad.

I took a seat in one of the comfy chairs by the fireplace and cracked open ‘Basic Illusion Magic’. I had wanted to jump right to the Basic Illusion spell, but there was a note at the top of the section saying that spellcasters should first know both Sound and Light before learning Basic Illusion so I did as it said. There was some preamble before the section that taught spells which explained the way that all illusion spells worked, but it seemed somehow incomplete. Much like ‘An Introduction to Practical Magic’ it seemed as if the book just failed to answer the sorts of basic follow up questions that anyone would ask after having the spells explained to them.

*Maybe it’s just my way of approaching a problem. Hell, I’ve probably spent more time in school than a lot of Mages my age or even older. Maybe they honestly don’t think of the same questions, though that does seem a rather arrogant assumption to make.*

I read over the descriptions of both spells before starting on the symbol memorization for sound, and I immediately saw some possibilities.

Sound apparently was the auditory counterpart to Light, and the two spells together formed the basis for illusion magic. It was much like light, for 1 mana per minute I got a relatively small effect. For light it was candlelight, for Sound it was a quiet sound, whispers, a buzzing insect, something like that. For 2 mana I got a large effect, for Light it was torchlight, for Sound it was anything between a whisper and a distant shout. Probably not enough to deafen someone if I set it off right near their ear, but I bet it would be surprising as hell. Voices were apparently not an option though, which did mean my ventriloquist act idea was unworkable.

Basic Illusion was the real prize though, this was something I could use on the road, as is, with no screwing around, to protect myself. I could make an illusory scene, ‘anything the caster may imagine’, with a volume of 1 cubic yard per mana I put into it. The preamble did mention that I couldn’t simply stretch out that 1 cubic yard into an impossibly thin sheet, but I had a decent amount of control over the dimensions, as long as the shape remained a rectangle of some sort. I could also move the illusion, though it mentioned that this took a great degree of concentration.

*I wonder if I can use this as a hacky invisibility spell, I guess it depends on how hard it is to move the illusion.*

I sat there for a while, learning Sound, and spinning my mana stone ring on my finger. That was another thing I’d need to test out, though probably not in the middle of an inn. I was already pushing it by reading the spell book in front of the fire, though unless you took a look inside the book it just seemed like any other, and I didn’t really want to draw more attention to myself.

# Chapter 14

I ate dinner late that night, not only did I have a hard time pulling myself away from my book, but waiting until later meant that I could eat dinner with Thera once she was done working. I wasn’t quite sure where I stood with her, but I hadn’t gotten robbed or stabbed to death in my sleep, so I wasn’t about to complain. I probably should have thought of the risks ahead of time, but a dry spell can only go on for so long before a man must take drastic, foolish action.

I’d finished teaching myself Sound by about midafternoon, which was consistent with how quickly I’d learned the other spells. So far it had taken me about eight to twelve hours to memorize a spell to the point where I could cast it without referring back to the book. Basic Illusion on the other hand seemed far more difficult, it might have just been me getting burnt out, but I felt like I should have been getting close at least. I’d started on Sound around seven in the morning, and finished around three in the afternoon. After getting the spell straight in my head I’d experimented with it a bit before having a very late lunch. I relaxed and gambled a bit with a few of the merchants still in the inn, but I started on Basic Illusion by about four. But it was all of six hours later and I still didn’t feel like I was even close to learning the spell.

I stretched my sore muscles, aside from my break and seeing to some basic necessities, I’d barely moved from the chair since this morning.

*Might just be that I’m rushing. I doubt that elf mages sit down and inhale a spell book over the course of a single day.*

I stuck the book into the front pocket of my hoodie and got up, a little unsteadily after being seated for so long, and went over to where Thera had just finished wiping down the bar.

“Hungry?” She asked in her bedroom voice, as I sat down across from her.

“Yeah,” I said, casting a look at a pair of dishes keeping warm in the oven.

“Do you also want something to eat?”

I laughed, “You are incorrigible.”

“I don’t know what incorrigible means, but it had better be flattering,” she said, getting out the meals she’d been saving for the two of us.

*Fish again, these guys eat a hell of a lot of fish. Maybe they’re not ‘city’ elves, ‘sea’ elves might be a better description. Especially if I’m right about the whole Greeco-Roman thing.*

“You know, you’re an odd one Quinn”

I raised an eyebrow, “You mean aside from the fact that I might be the only human in the world?”

She bit a her lower lip again, “Well it’s just that,” she hesitated, leaning forwards onto the bar, giving me a good look down the front of her dress, “I saw you talking and playing cards with those merchants. You talk like someone who’s actually seen a bit of the world, you even seemed to understand what that Ninsil family merchant was saying when he started going on about tariffs. And the way you were playing, I’ve seen plenty of gamblers come through here Quinn, and you were definitely sharping them.”

“You disapprove?” I asked, unsure. Despite her vampishness I didn’t think that Thera was a bad person, and she might not like it if she thought I was cheating at cards.

“No, it’s not like those men are going to miss their money. It’s just that you can do all that stuff, talk and gamble like you belong at a table with men like that, but then you turn around and act as naive as a child.”

“What?” I frowned, “What do you mean?”

“Did you consider, even for a second, that I might have been bedding you just so I could steal your purse and fancy rings? I could have just been taking advantage of you.”

“Yes,” I said, with conviction, “Well, after you left, yeah,” I finished, with less conviction.

She rolled her eyes, throwing up her hands, “You’re hopeless.”

“I was simply distracted by your unearthly beauty,” I said haughtily.

She gave me a flat look.

“What? I thought you liked flattery?”

She rolled her eyes again, sighing and unclasping her bracelet and dangling it negligently from one hand, “Do you still want this thing?” she asked, a little exasperated.

“Certainly, how much do you want for it?” I asked.

“Do you even know what this thing is worth? For all you know I could be taking advantage of you so I can pay for tuition in Nimre,” she said, seeming slightly annoyed.

*It was only fifty drachm for the book and the stone together, can’t be too expensive for just the one.*

“One hundred drachm,” I said.

She narrowed her eyes, “Quinn…”

“Yes?”

“You do understand how bartering works, right? Usually you start a little low, but not too low, and I start a little high, but not too high. Then we negotiate to somewhere in the middle, understand?”

“Fine, fine, I see how it is,” I said, nodding along with her explanation, “One hundred and fifty then?”

“Can you just lean over here please?” She asked, balling up one fist and narrowing her eyes.

“Threats now? Fine, but I can’t go any higher than two-“

She let out a defeated sigh, and put her head down on the bar, asking “You know that we’ve only known each other since lunch yesterday? You know that the stone is worth only a tenth of that. Why do this for me?”

*I don’t know, maybe I’m trying to make this world a little less terrible for young women in the small way that I can, maybe I found your story particularly sympathetic. Maybe I’m just an idiot.*

“Just think of it as taking advantage of me.” I provided.

She lifted her head to look at me, “Fine. But don’t think I’m going to sleep with you again just because you’re paying me.*

*Aw, dammit…*

“I’m only doing it because there’s literally no one else, and you promised to show me what you could do with magic.”

*Good, I guess?*

-----

Thera was a very eager research assistant. I’d imagine a new shape for the manipulators that Apportation created, and Thera would provide me with immediate feedback on their effectiveness. It’s amazing what you can do with five or six pairs of hands, and, other things.

“I always thought that mages would be boring old men sitting in dingy libraries reading dusty old tomes,” She said, a while later as we lay tangled in each other’s arms, “This is much more fun.”

“Mmm, I’m glad you enjoyed it. But I’m pretty sure I’m going to end up doing a lot reading when I get to Nimre though, not that I mind.”

She snuggled closer to my chest, it was late, and despite the warm climate it still got rather cold at night, “I could tell, you had just sat down to start reading when I left, and you were still reading when I got back. Did you get up at all while I was gone?”

“Uh, got up to go to the bathroom I think.”

“Ugh,” She said with exaggerated disgust, slapping me on the side, “How do you even do that?”

“Well usually I start by undoing my belt-“ she slapped me in the ribs again, “Ooof- Fine, what do you mean? You can read, I’ve even seen you reading sometimes when there’s not a lot of customers around.”

“Sure, but I don’t just sit there and do it all day. This is just like you, you’re really sharp, and somehow also really naïve. You’re really boring, but somehow you can also sit down at a gambling table and clean out all the men there. I don’t know why you decided to come here, you should be spending the week in some gambling den, then you’d have **two** women of questionable morals hanging off your arm and trying to get money out of you.”

I laughed, “One is plenty.”

She pulled back a little to give me a dangerous look.

“One very beautiful woman of questionable morals who I need to browbeat into taking my money?”

She snuggled back up to me, “You’re really not very good at flattery, are you?”

“I do my best.”

“What about the cards though, where did you learn to play like that?”

“Oh, even that involves sitting in libraries reading books,” I said, trying to explain the internet would take all night, “I didn’t actually cheat either, it was mostly just statistics.”

“Statistics?”

“Well,” I started, *how do I explain statistics, and not sound like the boringest boring person in the world,* “In the world I come from people have enough free time on their hands, and they take games seriously enough, that people will study a game like a Mage might study magic. I had plenty of time when I was waiting for the pass south to clear, so I spent some time pulling the rules apart, figuring out the probability of any given hand. The other players might have a gut feeling as to how probable a given hand is, but I know the figures exactly. I'll also try to keep track of what cards I've seen played already. Between that, and having worked out the probabilities of each, I usually have at least an idea of how good my hand is compared to the others.”

“Wait,” she said, trying to wrap her head around what I’d just said, “So, you know what cards they have in their hand?”

“Not quite, I know what cards they **probably** have. And even if I don’t know specifics, I’ll at least have an idea of whether their hand is better or worse than mine, and that’s really all I need.”

“Don’t humans have anything better to do?”

I thought of the many hundreds of hours spent playing videogames and watching Netflix.

“Nope.”

-----

I went out to find a messenger the following morning, Thera having pointed me in the right direction. She had the morning off like usual, and it looked like she wanted to ask if I wanted her along, but she seemed to recognize that I’d rather do this alone. I had turned it over in my head a few times, trying to do this properly, while minimizing the amount of hurt I inflicted on Sila. I had considered actually heading back and handing over the bracelet in person, but I didn’t think that would end well. I wouldn’t even know how to begin that conversation, let alone how to end it. Showing up out of the blue after she’d accepted the fact that I was leaving would be bad enough. But then what? If it still doesn’t light up I’d just be raising her up, to cast her back down again. The odds definitely favoured that outcome, I was not going to walk back there for the fifty to one shot that she had magic, when I’d just hurt her again if she didn’t.

I stopped outside the little storefront that the messenger business was run out of, and I drew out the bracelet, inspecting it. It was pretty beat up, the blue mage stone looked fine, but the rest of the bracelet looked rather shoddy. It was made of some base metal, pewter, tin, something like that, but plated with silver. It was the silver plating that was in rough shape, and the sections that hadn’t flaked off were badly tarnished.

*Not a great ‘Sorry I’m sleeping with someone else’ gift.*

I turned around, and headed for one of the lower end jewellers that I’d seen when looking for a place to sell my dice. I could go back to the place where I’d sold the aluminum, but such fancy jewellers weren’t the sorts of places that sold or worked on budget items like the bracelet. I found the store I’d been looking for and left the bracelet with them to be fixed up. It cost me a little extra to have it done by the following evening, but I didn’t know quite when I’d be leaving. If Thera told me that there was a ship heading out for Nimre tomorrow then I was probably going to be on it, and I didn’t want to be waiting around for the bracelet to be finished.

-----

I got back to the inn at lunchtime, and decided to keep plugging away at Basic Illusion. I had gone up to my room to retrieve the book when I heard someone knock lightly on the door, I turned to see Thera slipping inside.

“Progress!” I proclaimed.

Thera gave me a very strange look.

“Well I just don’t think you’ve ever bothered knocking before, usually you just barge in and throw yourself down on my bed,” I taunted.

“Oh, is that what you think I’m like?” She asked, taking deliberate steps towards me.

*Uh oh.*

“I think,” I started, in my Quinn-covers-his-ass-voice “That you’re a strong and independent woman, who knows what she likes and takes steps to get it on her terms.”

She sighed, shaking her head and laughing a little, “Fine. You’re not getting any right now though, I need to get to work in a minute. I just came up to let you know that I’ve found a ship for you, maybe for me aswell.”

“Oh?” I asked, not quite sure where this was going.

“Well there’s a ship leaving next Feastday, it’s a small mail carrier, but it has space for a passenger or two and should make the journey quickly. The next one after that is a cargo ship running fresh fruit, so it’ll also make the journey pretty quickly. There are a couple other ships, but they’ll be a bit later in the season. I, uh, think the mail carrier works pretty well for you,” she said, seeming a little awkward.

“And you’d take the cargo ship?” I asked, seeing where this was going, “I guess you’ve got enough now for passage and tuition?”

“Yeah, I mean, it’s not that I don’t enjoy your company Quinn. It’s just…” she trailed off.

“Hey, I get it.” I said congenially.

“You do?” She asked, hopefully.

*Yeah, hurts a little more than I thought it would, but yeah.*

“Yeah,” I said, not quite sadly.

She stepped up to me, jabbing a finger into my chest, “You’re still mine until Feastday though, understand? You go off to some gambling den like I said and I’ll kick your ass.”

I frowned, “Thanks, I guess?”

“You’re welcome,” she said, “The captain of the mail carrier wants 100 drachm, so that’s another reason not to go off gambling.”

She got up on tiptoe, grabbing me by the hair with one hand, to pull me down into a quick kiss, “Oh, and you might want to make sure to have your little illusion spell all finished up by tonight,” she whispered into my ear.

*What?*

“What?” I asked, as she let go.

“It’ll be a surprise,” she said, and there was a truly evil grin on her face as she slipped out of the room to get to work.

*Uh oh*

-----

I stayed in my room rather than venturing downstairs, I wasn’t sure what Thera had planned, but I wanted to be prepared so I wasn’t about to risk getting distracted. I should have known there would be trouble when I first told her about the spell, her eyes lit up like she with child-like wonder, except eviler. Especially when I mentioned that it might be possible to use the spell to turn someone invisible. *This might be a terrible idea.* I went ahead with my studies though, trusting that I had the self-control to say no if it seemed like she was going to try to coerce me into doing something I shouldn’t. *Is this the long con? But I didn’t even tell her about Basic Illusion until I started ‘testing’ some of my spells on her.*

It took me some time, about twice as long as it had for the beginner spells, but I eventually got to the point where I could cast Basic Illusion. The first thing I tried to do with the spell was break it. The book had mentioned that there was a limit to how much you could stretch the 1 cubic yard of volume, but hadn’t given any specifics beyond mentioning that I couldn’t make it infinitely thin, and infinitely tall. I cast the spell, imagining a big stone cube floating in the air. It looked like a cubic yard of stone at least, but then I didn’t really have any way to measure it. I tried stretching it and bending the outer boundaries of the spell into different shapes, cubes and spheres were apparently fine, but if I tried anything more complicated I just ended up with whichever of the two was closer. I could stretch the shape into an ellipsoid or a rectangle, and I used bits of twine to measure just how much I could stretch it. The cube itself must have been 3 feet to a side so I used that as the baseline of my very professional twine-based measuring system. I didn’t have exact figures, but it looked like I could stretch the illusion into a rectangle that was a little less than one foot deep, three and a half feet wide, and a little over 8 feet tall.

*So I guess I should have enough space to make an illusion of a person then?*

I tried just that, imagining myself standing where the stone block was. It worked! Though it was incredibly unnerving. I’d been expecting something fuzzy, or with sharper angles, something that looked more like a character model from the early 2000s than something from the holodeck. Instead, there I was. Same dark blue jeans, same dark blue hoodie, same burgundy t-shirt just peeking out at the collar. Not a hair was out of place, hell, I could even see individual pores. It was me, but perfectly still. The stillness made it look wrong, it wasn’t still like any person could ever be, it was still like a corpse. I dispelled the thing almost immediately, just looking at it made my adrenaline spike and my heart race. I’d half expected it to leap at me screaming like something out of a horror movie, and I couldn’t shake the feeling of wrongness, even after it was gone. I fell back onto the bed, staring up at the ceiling.

*Let’s work on literally anything else, like that magic ring I bought.*

If the shopkeeper I’d bought it from hadn’t been lying then the two smaller stones embedded in it each held one mana, and the larger one held two mana. I should be able to draw on both of those reserves to cast my spells, which would help a lot with what I figured was a very limited mana reserve.

*Hell, if my mana regeneration is so high then maybe I just need a bunch of magical bling.*

Before I’d gotten Basic Illusion working I had used Apportation to gauge my personal mana reserves, but that required heavy stuff to lift, and for the test to be worth anything I needed an approximation of what the stuff weighed. With Basic Illusion on the other hand I could tell how much power I was using just from the size of the cube I could make… yeah, I’d stick to cubes for now.

*Well the ring holds four mana, and I’ve got one, so five cubic yards?*

I cast the spell, getting nothing for my trouble. I knew by now what it felt like to cast a spell and then lose it, and what it felt like to cast a spell and have it fail altogether. This was what failure felt like. I tried again with four cubic yards, and I also got nothing. Three cubic yards worked just fine though, and I felt something change in the ring. Looking at it, I was sure that nothing looked different than before, but the stone in the centre **felt** dimmer. *I guess I’ve emptied the stone?* This was confirmed for me about a minute later when the spell ended and the illusion disappeared. I tried again with two cubic yards, which also worked, and again, one of the stones **felt** dimmer. About a minute after that the other stone went dim as well, and about a minute after that the spell lapsed, stone block disappearing. It looked strange, having a multi-ton boulder pop in and out of existience. I almost expected there to be some sort of sound when the block appeared, or maybe I’d feel some movement in the air. There was nothing like that though, if I’d had my eyes closed then I would have had no idea that the boulder was even there. Though that was rather the point I supposed, it was after all, an illusion.

*So I can only draw on one of these stones at a time. Not great, but it’s an improvement at least.*

I figured that I had a little time to experiment further before Thera would show up and drag me off to do something foolish, so I experimented with charging the mana stone. I had no luck, I tried treating mana stones like the mage stone, trying to ‘push’ on it, but I got nowhere. Fifteen minutes later Thera slipped into the room, and fifteen minutes later the stones were still empty.

“Ready?” She asked, with that evil smile again.

“For what exactly?” I asked, “And why do I get the feeling that whatever you want me to help you with is not the sort of thing that a proper young lady and proper young man should be doing?”

She looked like she was about to answer, but instead she just grinned evilly, biting at her lower lip.

“I’m not going to like this at all am I?” I asked.

“Oh, I don’t know.”

*Oh, I am fucked.*

-----

And as it turned out, I was exactly right.

# Chapter 15

I was exhausted, and could hear my ribs creaking under the enormous pressure, I was sure that something was going to break. Thera suddenly choked out a short, high scream, before crumpling forwards bonelessly. It was suddenly deathly quiet, and after gathering my strength I shoved Thera off of me and to the side.

“Mhmm, I hope none of neighbours heard us,” she panted from where she lay on the bed.

“Well they certainly didn’t hear me,” I said dryly.

-----

Getting into Thera’s house had not been easy. She lived with her family in a nicer part of town, in an area that reminded me more of Victorian brownstones than some Greco-Roman domus. According to Thera she had the house to herself for the time being, *ayy baby*, but she was apparently expected to head back home once she finished up at the inn. Something that she hadn’t been doing the past couple of days. She told me about ‘Goodwife Prisa’, who she just called Miss Priss. Miss Priss lived across the street and had apperantly been set the task of watching for Thera as she came home by Thera’s mother. It was Miss Priss’s job then to make sure that Thera wasn’t doing something like… staying at the inn to sleep with strange men.

“I can usually get away with telling her that I did walk home while she wasn’t watching, but if she sees a big scary giant going into my house she’ll probably notice that something’s up,” she had told me.

This was why Thera was so interested in the applications of Basic Illusion, according to her she’d never been able to sneak any of her… friends… by Miss Priss’s observations, and she was very eager to finally have someone in her own bed. Luckily I was able to use the spell I’d learned to make myself invisible, but it was very far from perfect. I could use the volume the spell gave me to make a sort of ‘hide’ which would render me invisible while I was inside of the spell’s footprint. The trouble was moving the hide once it was in place. I could make an illusion of a person and have them walk around, but it took a surprising amount of mental effort, enough that I had a hard time moving the spell and walking at the same time. This meant that while I had my little invisibility cloak, I had to move at a snail’s pace to keep the spell together. Thera had a coach pick her up from the inn and was home in less than ten minutes. With the spell on it took me that long just to walk from the intersection where her street met the main thoroughfare, to her front door. I managed to use the spell to mask the front door opening as I entered though, which I suppose does solve one of the major hurdles when it comes to invisibility.

-----

“What are you doing?” Asked Thera a little sleepily, as she stepped into the kitchen. She was wearing only my sweater, which was a look I rather liked.

“Cooking breakfast?”

“I’m impressed that nothing’s on fire,” she teased, “It doesn’t even look like you’ve burnt any of the food.”

“Hey! What’s that supposed to mean?” I asked, a little indignantly.

“Well, it’s just strange to have a man cooking for me. It’s actually kind of sweet.”

“What, do elven men just not cook?” I asked, *I suppose that fits with the Victorian/Greco-Roman theme that this world seems to follow.*

“Some, but only if it’s their job. Cooks cook, and some innkeepers might man the stove once in a while, but there’s no way father would ever cook for us. Mother or one of the servants is always expected to do the cooking.”

“Uhh, servants?” I asked, flipping the pancakes.

“Don’t worry,” she said, giggling a little as she saw my expression, “No one’s going to walk in on us. I’m pretty sure that one of the servants would have heard us if they were here last night.”

“Hear you, you mean” I protested, as I dished the pancakes. There was no maple syrup, but I made do with peanut butter and some preserves.

“Oh, did I embarrass you?” She teased, “I’ve always got to be so quiet when I’m back at the inn. I think that was the first time I’d really been able to let myself go. What’s this?” She asked, changing the subject.

“Pancakes!”

-----

Leaving the house ended up being more difficult than entering it, and that didn’t even include Thera tackling me when I tried to leave before she had quite finished with me. When I’d snuck in late last night the street had been empty, so I hadn’t needed to worry about someone bumping into me as I tiptoed down the street. This was not the case in the morning as people were heading out to start the day. It took some time, and it was a little nerve-wracking, but I managed to get to the end of the street. Basic Illusion redeemed itself though, when I realized that I’d need to find some way to pop into view on a somewhat busy street corner. I set up the illusion so that from the point of view of anyone behind me, there was simply an empty street. From the view of those walking down the street though they just saw me step around the corner and keep on walking. It wasn’t foolproof, but on the other hand most people were too busy with their own lives to really pay attention to the little inconsistencies in my illusion.

I had originally planned on walking around a little, maybe find what passed for a church or temple here in Rhona, but the stares I was getting quickly changed my mind. It made me feel a little self-conscious, and while no one was going to stop me and tell me I couldn’t just walk around the city, I still felt rather awkward drawing so much attention. Instead I found one of the bookstores I’d been by earlier, and I poked around looking for a book on local religions. A book was probably a better option than stumbling around if I wanted some idea of the local religious beliefs anyway. I was not a particularly devout person, but I figured that I should probably have some idea of other people’s beliefs, it would be very easy for me to end up in trouble if I made some religious gaffe.

I found a simple primer on the local religions, and headed back to The Anchor Chain to read. Aside from a bit of gambling, the book would give me something to do other than Thera. I realized, as I sat down in one of the comfy chairs by the fire, that I was really going to miss Thera. Our attraction had been almost entirely physical, and probably wouldn’t ever have become more than that, but I enjoyed her company and she was fun to talk to.

*Well, hopefully I’ll see her again once we’ve both made it to Nimre, even if we’re not going to pick up where we left off.*

I flipped through the book, finding that Rhona and the rest of Eladria seemed to have a pantheistic religious structure, *like any good D&D campaign world,* though there seemed to be some overlap between the different deities. There wasn’t just one ‘God of Law’ for example, instead there were a few deities that each claimed some amount of dominion over Law. This held true in most other areas, there was more than one god of the sea mentioned, more than one god of magic. From what I read there was as much competition between the rival gods within one dominions as there was between them and the gods that opposed their dominion in some way. One particularly interesting deity I found was Verrin, a goddess of feminine pleasure and dominance, *Thera must be a* ***very*** *devout follower.*

I wasn’t lucky enough to find a simple list of ‘Stuff That Offends People’ though, and with such a mess of competing religious beliefs what might offend one group would be seen as perfectly fine by another.

Instead I paid particular attention to gods that claimed some dominion over the sea. I found a few, though the text mentioned that there were several more that weren’t listed and that these were just the three most common. There was Okeanis who claimed, or his followers claimed, dominion over merchants and seagoing trade. There was Sakana, a goddess of the ‘Ocean’s Bounty’, and judging from the illustration that accompanied the passage she was **very** bountiful. Lastly there was Mar, god of sailors and naval warfare, and in addition to that he apparently also had some claim over the dead. It was written that he was responsible for the souls of all who perished at sea.

I guessed that the captain of the mail carrier would be a follower of Okeanis, if he was religious at all, but since the text really only gave a brief overview of many gods I still only had a general idea of how a devout follower of Okeanis might behave. I sighed, it had been a good idea at least. I did need some idea of the social norms and cultural mores of this world, after all, really all I knew about elves was that they were about as sexist as humans were at this point in history. Not a big surprise.

-----

I ate lunch at The Anchor Chain, but went out again in the afternoon to get the refurbished bracelet from the jeweller. I was pleased with the work, and aside from the weight it looked might have been made wholly of silver. The blue stone complemented the silver finish well, and I paid the man for his work, leaving a nice tip. I still wasn’t entirely sure that elves tipped, but so far no one had been surprised when I’d done it, so I wasn’t about to stop. *It’s like a bribe, except classier.*

I’d written a letter to Sila explaining the reason for the gift, mainly outlining that the previous mage stone wouldn’t have lit whether she was a mage or not. I tried not to get her hopes up, but I gave her a brief run through of how the meditation would go, it had been some time after all since she’d last tried it. I wasn’t really sure if I wanted her to be a mage or not, but it seemed only fair to give her a chance. On the one hand I might find it rather awkward to have her with me at the school, but on the other hand, if she had magic there would be a whole world of new possibilities opened up to her. I knew that I’d gotten beyond any romantic feelings for her when she first tried to hop into bed with me, but she had still been a very good friend, and I wanted her to do well. *I guess we’ll see, won’t we.*

-----

Two short days later I was walking up the gangplank onto the ship that would take me to Nimre. Thera had come to see me off, and to make sure that everything went smoothly with the captain. I hadn’t met him before today, and Thera was kind enough to make the introductions for me. She’d certainly put me through the wringer over the last couple of days, protesting that she’d expected to have me for a whole week, so she wasn’t about to let me get off easy just because I was leaving a little earlier than expected. I wasn’t one for long goodbyes, and thankfully neither was Thera. She’d given me a quick peck on the cheek and I’d boarded the ship, we’d done the real goodbyes the night before after all.

The gangplank was pulled up, and the ship cast off. I waved as the sails caught the wind and the ship was pulled out to sea. I could see Thera waving as well, before she hurried off back to The Anchor Chain. She would be leaving on her own lengthy voyage a week from now, and had a lot to take care of before then.

I stayed up on the deck as the small mail carrier started to pick up speed. I had no frame of reference for how fast a fast ship was, but the captain had told me that the trip would take about twenty days. It was about five thousand miles over land to Nimre, probably a bit more by sea, so the ship was probably moving at ten or eleven miles an hour. I wasn’t terribly impressed by this, but apparently that was very good time for the run from Myra to Nimre. Cargo ships, like the one Thera would take, would apparently do the journey in as many as fifty days.

The captain, a man named Enutur, came down to speak with me once we were well underway. He was a portly man, roughly five feet tall, and dressed a little gaudily. He wore a red tunic, with a darkish yellow braid along the edges. It seemed as if he was trying to pass it off as cloth-of-gold, and he honestly wasn’t doing a terrible job of it. A similar dark yellow braid tied the tunic at the waist, and his legs were bare below the knee. He definitely fit the Greco-Roman aesthetic, which set him apart from most of the elves on the coast who seemed to have a little more Victorian influence.

*Some of what’s making it hard to adapt is probably my trying to understand everything with the lens of historical Europe, I’d probably have a lot better handle on things if I tried to look at this world on its own merits. After all, as far as I knew there wasn’t going to be a whole lot of influence from Earth, I might very well be the only human on the planet.*

“Aye, you look like you’re a little far from home,” he said, by way of greeting.

“Yeah, you could say that,” I said dryly.

“Banestorm?” He asked.

*Everyone just seems to take it for granted. Strange creature dropped out of the sky from a different and exotic world? Happens all the time.*

“Yup.”

“Been here long?” He asked.

“Ah,” I looked down at my watch, which told me it was June 4th,”Six months, four days.”

“Really, and that thing keeps track for you?” He asked, looking at my watch.

“Yeah, you’ve got a clock on board don’t you? This thing is just a miniature version of that,” I explained.

“We don’t have a clock, but I know what you mean. Must be awfully advanced where you come from, what did you do before you came here?” He asked, though it felt a little more like an interrogation.

*He recognizes that some worlds are more advanced, hell, I bet that’s the reason for the somewhat messy distribution of technology here. You get the odd Outsider from a world a little bit ahead, and to make a name for themselves they introduce a little bit of their world’s technology.*

“I was a mathematician,” I said, which was close enough to the truth, “Why the interest?”

“Oh, you know, you hear about Outsiders all the time, but when do you ever get to meet one?”

“Well,” I pondered, “So far everyone **I’ve** met is an Outsider.”

“I suppose they are, what are you called anyway? Are all the people from your world as big as you?” He asked. I did definitely feel like he was prying a little, but on the other hand he seemed motivated mainly by curiosity. Being on the captain’s good side was probably a smart idea anyway, so I played along.

“I’m a human,” I explained, ”Though no, most humans aren’t quite as tall as me. I’m a bit slimmer, and a lot taller than most humans. The average human man is something like five foot nine, and the average woman about five foot four. So the average human woman is about as tall as the tallest elves I’ve met.”

“Hmm,” he considered, “You said you were a mathematician, is that why you’re going to Nimre? Going to try to teach at one of the universities?”

*Probably best not to tell him you’re a Mage.*

“Yeah, I’m pretty sure I can show the professors there a thing or two. I noticed that your numbering system could use some work, it reminds me of roman numerals, and there seems to be no concept of zero.”

“Uh, what do you mean?” He asked, confused.

“Well it’s complicated,” I said, understating the problem, “But the numbering system I’ve seen used so far is kind of limited, it’s much easier to do more complicated operations with a positional system. I think calculus and even algebra are areas of math that might not even exist here, at least as far as I’ve seen.”

I was pretty sure I’d lost him somewhere along the way, but he was nodding along encouragingly.

“Well, that’s all very interesting,” he said, not terribly interested, “Why don’t I show you to your room so you can put your things away. Is that all you have?” He asked, nodding towards my bag and the bundle of books I’d collected in the past couple days.

“Yeah, I didn’t arrive here with a whole lot in the first place.”

-----

He showed me below decks to an empty room that looked like it might have been meant for cargo, though no cargo was present. It was somewhat uncomfortable below decks, since the ceiling *bulkhead? Or is a wall a bulkhead?* was only about five feet up. The lightly rocking ship didn’t make me feel any better in the cramped confines of the ship

“I’ll have to get a bed brought in for you…” he trailed off, looking at how I was hunched over in the empty room, “Um…”

“Why don’t I just string my hammock between some of these hooks, they’re meant for cargo aren’t they? They should be able to take my weight,” I said, gesturing at some of the cargo hooks along the wall.

“Ah, they should be able to. But what’s a hammock?” He asked.

“I’ll show you,” I said, taking the hammock out of my bag and stringing it between the two opposite walls. I pulled myself up into the hammock once I had it set up, luxuriating in the Quinn-sized sleeping accommodations.

“I suppose that works,” he remarked.

“Don’t most sailors sleep in hammocks?” I asked, slipping out of the hammock and onto the floor. *deck?*

“No, I’ve never seen one of these before,” he said, considering my creation.

“Well here’s an idea you can have for free,” I offered, “Where I’m from hammocks were used by sailors as a place to sleep for hundreds of years. They move with the ship so it’s easier to sleep in rough seas, it’s awfully hard to get thrown out of one, and they pack up small. You could even string these above your cargo, letting you carry more, rather than have some floor space taken up by beds.”

He was nodding, thoughtful, “That is very clever, I’ll have to get some made once we reach Nimre. It’s just rope netting?” He asked.

“Well, you can use anything really. This one’s just knotted ropes so it stands up to the wilderness better, but the hammocks used by sailors were made out of sheets of cloth instead since it’s a bit more comfortable.”

He clapped me on the shoulder, “Well if you get tired of your books you’re welcome to join me and the crew in the galley for cards and dice ‘round supper time.”

“That’s awfully kind of you,” I said, glad for the chance to recoup some of the costs of the voyage.

-----

I had explained pancakes to the cook fairly early on. One downside to a non-stop voyage like the mail carrier did was that they didn’t get the chance to resupply during the trip. Now they certainly had the space to carry plenty of food, but some things just don’t keep for that long, so as the journey wore on the food would get worse. This meant that for the last week or so of the journey it would be dried meat and hardtack for everyone. Unless of course, someone introduced them to the most Canadian of cuisine, pancakes! Well, crepes, which are sort of French, but then Canada is sort of French. Most of the ingredients you needed to make proper pancakes wouldn’t keep any longer than the rest of their food, but crepes weren’t too difficult to make with what was at hand. There was even some peanut butter, which they normally used along with some of their other condiments and seasonings to make the hardtack edible.

My improvements made the food later in the journey, if not great, at least okay. But I started to notice something in the crew, especially the younger crew, as we got closer to Nimre. As the good food stores started to run out and we ended up eating more of the food I’d taught to the cook I noticed that, aside from the captain, most of the crew seemed not to finish most of what the cook made. They all assured me and the cook that this was much better than their normal fare and that they were glad for the better food, but much of it was left uneaten. I’d thought that it simply became a bit of a slog. Crepes with peanut butter and dried meat on the side three times a day for over a week gets rather boring. So it made perfect sense that they wouldn’t have much of an appetite. This was not the reason, and if I’d been more of a people person I might have figured out what was going on ahead of time. As it was, I didn’t figure it out, and things did not go well.

-----

I was up on the deck reading one of the books I’d bought before leaving Myra while leaning over the railing that faced the open ocean. We’d been making good time, and there were only two days left in the journey. One upside to such a simple ship was that it could be run with a relatively small crew. Between that and the ample space for crew accommodations and food the ship was able to fit a whole second shift, which let the ship travel just fine through the night. We were a little more than five hundred miles from Nimre, and maybe a few hours from the border between Admypia and Ashur when I noticed that we’d slowed nearly to a stop. I looked around, and caught the eye of a crewmen that had just climbed down the mast, and I saw the guilty look in his eyes before he scurried into the captain’s cabin.

*Oh god dammit.*

I scanned the deck of the ship, but saw that aside from the man who’d just climbed down the mast the deck was empty except for the helmsman. Looking across the deck of the ship I could see the shore a few miles distant, but between the ship and the shore was an Admypian Trireme, and it was already damned close. From the mast flew two banners, the one above was the Admypian Ensign, and the one below was the house flag of some Admypian merchant family. This gave me a thought, and I looked up to the mast of my own ship. What do you know? There was a third banner flying there. There was the Rhonan Ensign and the house flag of the family Enutur worked for, which I’d expected, but there was also a solid red flag with a triangular notch cut out of the end of it.

*Hmm, do I have time to kill Enutur before they show up?*

I looked towards the captain’s cabin, to see Enutur and three crewmen step onto the deck. The crew looked rather abashed, though Enutur was clearly making an effort to remain expressionless. He shouted something, and some more crewmen made their way up from below decks. The cowards wouldn’t even look at me as they prepared receive the Admypian ship. The crew that had come out of the captain’s cabin stuck with Enutur though, I guess Enutur had realized that I might have some objections to his business arrangement.

I forced myself to relax, leaning against the railing *bulwark?* and putting on a false air of confidence. I did a mental inventory, and I didn’t come up with a very large list, most of my stuff was below decks and wouldn’t be useful in the first place. I had one of my four colour pens, the nicer of my two multitools, the folding knife, my watch, my rings, and my jacket. Oh, and one book on Nimrean history.

*And in my pack below decks is a spellbook that will damn me if found.*

I ran through my options as quickly as I could, knowing that the second the Admypians boarded the list would get a lot shorter. I didn’t come up with many escape plans. In fact, I came up with only one, and it was really terrible.

I stayed where I was, leaning against the rail *unless it’s a bulwark* and waited as the Admypian ship pulled up alongside. I unzipped the front pocket of my coat, slipping my glasses inside as I watched while ropes were tied off on both ships. A gangplank was laid across the narrow gap left between the ships, and five men walked across. Now the Admypians looked Roman, no Greco- about it. The man, or should I say elf, at their head wore what looked just like the Roman armour I’d seen on the History channel. He had the stereotypical Roman helmet, though it had no plume, and the segmented plate armour that I was sure was called Lorica Sement-somthingorother. Except for the too-large eyes he was the very model of a Roman soldier. *Oh, he’ll do very nicely.* The other four wore the same Roman style of helmet as their leader, but had mail on instead of the heavier plate armour. It was probably lighter and easier to get out of, since swimming in that plate armour was probably not fun at all.

I saw the leader look dismissively towards Enutur, before approaching me with the other four soldiers in tow.

“Hi,” I said, with exaggerated friendliness.

The leader blinked at this, he was probably expecting more screaming, shouting, and crying, “Why hello there, I don’t suppose you’re going to come peacefully?” He asked with equally exaggerated friendliness, “I’d really rather not damage you.”

“Sure thing,” I said cheerfully, “Just one thing before I go though, I need to get a refund.”

“What?” The leader said, seeming rather confused.

“Enutur, he said he’d take me to Nimre, and I paid him 100 drachm for the trouble. Now I find out that he’s not going to take me the whole way? Worse still he’s trying to sell me into slavery! Preposterous, I demand a refund.” I said indignantly, I even stamped a foot.

The leader opened his mouth to speak, but didn’t seem to find the words. He choked out a short laugh, finding humour in the absurdity of it all, “ENUTUR!” He bellowed, “Get over here!”

“What?” Enutur wheedled, “You can’t seriously-”

“Get over here!”

As Enutur made his way reluctantly across the deck the man in the armour leaned in a little, speaking quietly, “You do know that we’re going to take it as soon as you board, right?”

“Oh yeah I know, but fuck this guy,” I responded.

The soldiers didn’t seem to know what to make of it as Enutur counted out my money, even Enutur seemed astonished as he was doing it. I pocketed the money, and the leader waved dismissively at Enutur.

“What about my pay?” Enutur fretted.

One of the soldiers threw a coin pouch at Enutur, hitting him in the face, and Enutur clutched at the money as he made his way a little quickly back to the safety of his crewmen. The soldiers then drew out a pair of manacles, a short chain connected the hand and foot restraints. *Shit.*

“Really, am I going to run away?” I asked sarcastically.

“Do shut up,” said the leader, losing the feigned friendliness now that he was done playing with Enutur.

I wanted to leap at the man and shove my fingers though his eyes and into his brain, but I had to be patient and calm if I was going to get out of this. As much as it pissed me off to let them put the manacles on me, they’d be less on edge if they though I wasn’t the sort to put up a fight. The wrist manacles went on first, but thankfully I’d guess right, and the chain that connected them to the ankle manacles was far too short of someone my size.

“Can you get them around his legs?” asked the leader.

The chain was so short that the only real option was trying to get them around my thighs, and there was no way that was going to happen. *Never skip leg day.* They fiddled around with the manacles a little, but it was clear that it wasn’t going to happen.

“Enough,” snapped the leader, “Let’s get him on the ship.”

“Awful lot of trouble, just for one human,” I prodded, I had a sick curiosity in just how much I might be worth.

“Awful lot of money, just for one human,” said the leader, grabbing me by the bicep as we stepped up onto the gangplank.

It was a little unsteady, since each end of the gangplank was rising and falling with each ship. I slowed a little, which put him a little ahead of me as he pulled me across the gangplank by my arm. I looked down at the manacles, loose ends dangling near my knees.

“Hey, I wonder which is heavier, these manacles, or your armour?” I asked, and I threw myself towards him, just as he took a step.

I think he had probably been ready for me to try to pull away from him, but catching him off balance, and pushing towards instead of pulling away caught him by surprise. He tried to stay on his feet, his shorter stature and lower centre of gravity helping a lot, and he almost made it. Almost didn’t cut it though, and we both tumbled into the water between the ships. I managed to control the fall enough that he landed under me in the water, and I went out of my way to try to boot him in the abdomen when I landed on him. I was rewarded with a **whoof** as the air was knocked out of him right before his head went under, and I pushed away quickly to stop him from grabbing at my legs. I ended up under the surface as well, but where I’d been ready for it, he hadn’t and was now entirely out of breath. I could see him foundering in the murky water, trying to swim to the surface and unbuckle his armour at the same time. I surfaced, and could immediately hear the chaos I’d started above. The four soldiers were shouting conflicting commands, and I could hear more voices on both ships shouting back. I looked over at where the leader had ended up, and I could see the odd flailing limb breach the surface. I took in a huge breath, and dove.

It was not easy, swimming with both hands tied. But I managed a modified doggy paddle, the weight didn’t help a whole lot, but it did make it easier to stay under the surface as I swam under the Admypian ship. Both crews would be distracted by the man in the water, so I only needed to stay below the surface long enough to get clear of the immediate area. If I stayed below water not only would they lose track of me, they might even think that I’d drowned, dragged to the bottom by the manacles.

I managed to swim all the way under the Admypian ship, it had a surprisingly shallow draft, and I kicked as hard as I could towards, what I hoped was, the shore. It felt like I had spent an hour swimming under the water, but it couldn’t have been more than thirty seconds. I surfaced, being careful not to inhale any water along with the much needed air. I rolled onto my back, just buoyant enough to stay above water, and kicked away from the ships. I could see that they were still tied together and from the look of the figures moving around on the decks they were in total chaos. I wasn’t sure if they’d pulled their man out of the water or not, but thankfully I didn’t see anyone looking in my direction as I kicked towards shore.  I slowed my pace a little once I decided that I was clear of the ships. It would be no good to exhaust myself, and I had quite a ways to go. The shore hadn’t quite been on the horizon as we were traveling, but that only meant that it was three or four miles away, instead of five or six.

*Just think of it as a hundred laps of the pool.*

I’d done plenty of swimming along with all the biking and running, I had even done a hundred laps in a single session before, but I’d never done it with my hands tied. I’d known it was a stupid plan when I first thought of it, and I only became more certain of that as I swam. The tide was going in, which did help a little, unfortunately it also meant that the closer I got to shore the more waves there were crashing over my face. I managed to avoid inhaling any water, but the whole time I swam I was sure that I was about a second away from a watery grave. I managed to get through the breakers, avoid any under tow currents, and get to shore. I was gasping and sputtering as I tried to get my feet under me, waves crashing into me and knocking me flat each time I pulled myself up. My legs felt like they were made of lead, and I barely had enough coordination to crawl out of the surf. I did it though, dragging myself out of the sea and clear of the waves.

I crumpled forwards onto the ground, and managed to roll onto my side. I lay there gasping, noticing for the first time that the manacles had cut up my wrists. They did not fit well, and with the other half hanging loose they’d been jerked around by the current and the waves as I neared the shore. *Something about the multitool, need to get these off.* I was so exhausted that I could barely think straight, and I felt a stab of panic before I remembered that my glasses were in my pocket, and not lost to the sea.

“I’m really quite impressed,” said a woman’s voice, “did you really swim all that way with your hands tied?”

*Oh for fucks sake.*


# Chapter 16

I crumpled forwards onto the ground, and managed to roll onto my side. I lay there gasping, noticing for the first time that the manacles had cut up my wrists. They did not fit well, and with the other half hanging loose they’d been jerked around by the current and the waves as I neared the shore. *Something about the multitool, need to get these off.* I was so exhausted that I could barely think straight, and I felt a stab of panic before I remembered that my glasses were in my pocket, and not lost to the sea.

“I’m really quite impressed,” said a woman’s voice, “did you really swim all that way with your hands tied?”

*Oh for fucks sake.*

-----

I managed to haul myself up onto my knees, and saw three blurry figures spread out along the beach. I sighed heavily, and I pulled open my chest pocket, withdrawing my glasses. I slipped them on, and seeing things clearly did not make me feel any better. In the centre was an elf woman wearing a self-satisfied smile, and she seemed short even for a member of her specifies. Even kneeling as I was, we were nearly at eye level. She wore a dress of light blue silk, and over the dress was something that looked like a hybrid between a shawl and a cloak it was made of a coarser material, but dyed a rich green. Her gold hair was up in a bun, held in place with a pair of jade hairpins. The two other figures on the beach were women as well, though they wore the same style of segmented plate armour as the man I’d booted into the sea. Both had silver hair up in a bun, though their hairpins seemed to be wood rather than jade, and they each had a helmet tucked under one arm. They were both fairly large for elven women, maybe five and a half feet tall, and judging from the similarities the two were probably sisters. They were spread out widely on the beach, not quite surrounding me, but ready to move if I tried anything.

“This is not fair,” I said, with equal parts exhaustion and exasperation, “How could you even notice me in the water?”

She pursed her lips, and pointed behind me. I turned, to see the two ships I’d left in a rather poor state. It seems that I’d underestimated the amount of chaos I’d caused by throwing the leader off the gangplank. The two ships were twisting around each other, but some of the ropes tying them together must have snapped or come loose, because they weren’t side by side anymore. Instead the prow of the Admypian trireme was buried in the side of Enutur’s mail carrier, and that side of the mail carrier had been smashed in. The two ships were still afloat, but neither would be fit to sail any time soon.

“It caught my attention, and I had my coach driver stop so I could get a better look. And what do I find? A prize from the sea, bestowed by Sakana herself,” I could hear the smile in her voice, and I turned back to look towards the shore.

I looked up and down the beach, considering. To the east was the city, less than a mile away, which meant that fleeing in that direction would not end well. The empty beach stretched on into the west, and I could see a wide road and empty fields up the embankment. It was clear of opposition, but it was also clear of cover. That was assuming of course that I’d be able to run, and right now even standing seemed like it would take a titanic effort. I considered using an illusion, but discounted it almost immediately. Exhausted as I was I didn’t think I could hold one of the spells together well enough to have it move around convincingly, and I’d need two, one to distract the soldiers and one to hide in until they were drawn away. And as far as I’d been able to test, I needed to see the area I was moving the illusion to. *And if the trick was discovered? I’d be double fucked.*

“Considering your options?” She asked, with an almost sympathetic tone.

I looked down at my bloody wrists, seriously considering a run for it, regardless of how hopeless it would be. But as much as I hated the thought of being a slave, I wasn’t really the sort for bloody last stands. It probably wouldn’t go down like that anyway, the soldiers would be far more likely to club me over the head than stab me through the back, and then I’d still be captured. *It fucking kills me to do it, but I need to play along.*

“Oh it’s not so bad,” she said as she walked towards me, “You’ll have a far better life with me, than you’d have wherever you were going.”

“Come on,” she said gently, taking hold of my forearms and helping me up. *So were going for induced Stockholm Syndrome then.*

I got my feet under me, and she took a surprised step back when she realized just how big I was. She couldn’t have been more than four and a half feet tall, and her soldiers edged a little closer when they saw her reaction. She gathered herself quickly, and waved them back. She stepped in close to me, and withdrew a crude key from her pocket. *Don’t try to strangle her Quinn, remember, we’re playing along. No strangling people. Yet.* She was very gentle as she unlocked the manacles, making sure not to aggravate my wounds, and she dropped the rough iron chains into the sand.

“Come along, we’ll get you cleaned up,” she said, in the same sort of voice you might use with a skittish horse.

I matched her gaze, looking into her big blue eyes. *I’ve really got to do this, haven’t I?*

“It won’t be so bad,” she continued softly, taking my arm to steady me as I nearly fell over from exaustion, “I know you’re probably frightened, and far from home, but it’s not as bad as you’ve heard. What’s your name?”

“Quinn,” I said, after a moment of silence.

“Well Quinn, I’m Lady Chypia.”

Her soldiers trailed back a little as we climbed up the embankment and onto the road. Sitting there was a small coach, and sitting in the driver’s position was a young girl. She wore a tunic, and on her wrists were a pair of narrow silver cuffs. They weren’t linked together, but it was clear what they were meant to symbolize. She saw the state of my wrists and her eyes widened a little, hand going to her mouth.

“Fetch your things Millie.”

The girl, Millie, pulled something out from under the seat and hopped down.

“Please, sit,” said Chypia, still in her ‘frightened animal’ voice, “We’ll have to get you out of those wet clothes once we’re back home.”

I sat down on the running board of the coach, and Millie rushed over with a case. She set it down next to me, and looking inside I could see that it was an ancient approximation of a first aid kit. Millie looked like she was about to set to work but Chypia motioned her away.

“I’ll take care of this Millie, you tend to the horses.” *Definitely trying for the whole Stockholm Syndrome thing.*

I held out my arms and she tended to my wounds, using some sort of strong grain alcohol to disinfect the wounds. It stung like hell, but at least it wouldn’t get infected, though I was worried that tetanus might still be a risk. Assuming I got a pair of cuffs like the driver I wouldn’t have too hard a time getting back out of the city once I was in better shape. I’d need to be very careful, but I bet that I’d be able to throw a Basic Illusion over myself and just walk out the city gates. I had lost all of my stuff, but I might be able to make do for the week and a half it would take me to get to Nimre. In fact, once I thought about it I had to be awfully close to the border with Ashur. I had only been two days out by ship, before I disembarked rather hastily, so there couldn’t be that much more Admypia left to pass through.

*Rest up, get out under cover of illusion, and then book it for the border.*

I felt a little surer of myself now that I had a clear idea of how to deal with my imminent enslavement. The best antidote to fear is information, and having a plan went a long way to dispelling any feelings of hopelessness or helplessness.

Once Chypia was done cleaning out the wounds she wrapped up my wrists in clean bandages. I just leaned against the side of the carriage, exhausted and soaked. *Everything is sitting back on that damn ship. If Enutur tries to sell my things in Admypia while he’s getting the ship repaired someone might discover the spellbook, I need to get the hell out of here as fast as possible.*

Chypia touched a hand to my face, “That’s better, isn’t it?” She asked. *Laying it on rather thick aren’t we?*

I didn’t trust myself to speak, and nodded slightly instead. She helped me stand, opened the door of the coach for me.

“Take a seat, don’t worry about it getting wet, just sit,” she said gently but firmly.

I forced myself to play along, and I ducked into the carriage. I leaned my head against the window and closed my eyes, still reeling from exhaustion. A short time later I heard the door creak, and opened my eyes to see Chypia and one of the guards join me in the carriage. Both of them sat on the seat across from me, and I looked over the female soldier. She wasn’t quite what I expected from a military woman. She still wore makeup, though not a lot, and still kept her hair long. Even done up like it was, it was going to be slightly impractical with the helmet on. That wasn’t to say that she seemed unsuitable for the job though, she was clearly quite fit and carried herself well. She also wore no cuffs on her wrists.

“Is this the first time you’ve seen a woman in military service?” Asked Chypia, noticing me eyeing her guard.

*Maybe Admypians are less sexist, despite the whole slavery thing?*

“She’s the first I’ve seen here,” I replied, “it’s not so strange where I come from, though men still make up the bulk of the military.”

“Oh?” Chypia asked, smiling, “Just where are you from?”

“Canada,” I sighed.

“Oh, and what’s that like?” She asked, seeming eager to learn more about her new acquisition.

“Well,” I started, exhaustion making it hard to collect my thoughts, “It’s really cold, and really big. But mostly it’s just really boring.”

“Boring? Oh it must be at least a little bit interesting,” she chided.

“Hey, boring is good. If things are interesting it probably means something is going wrong, I strive every day to be as boring as possible. Hell, I went to university for computer science, that’s about as boring as it gets.”

She seemed taken aback, “You know, most men usually try to sell themselves a little better.”

“Well actually I’m pretty sure that the guys who were trying to sell me are on their way to the bottom of the bay,” I said wryly, jabbing a thumb out the window.

“Fine,” she said, biting off a quick laugh, “You said you went to university? You’re educated then?” And I could see the wheels turning in her head.

It was clear that I was going to get put to work doing something, so I might as well aim for something that would make escape easier.

“Yeah, lots of classes on mathematics, plenty of research papers to write,” *Please be a scribe, please be a scribe, please be a scribe.*

“Mmm, I’d have plenty of chances to show you off if I had you working as my steward,” *Close enough.* “How would you like that?” She offered congenially.

*She does seem to be trying to make things bearable for me, but I doubt it’s simply done out of the goodness of her heart.*

“I suppose,” I hedged.

Chypia was about to respond, but was distracted as the carriage stopped. I could hear voices outside, and guessed that we’d reached the city gates.

She pulled aside the shutter, “Guardsmen?” She called.

“Oh, no need to trouble yourself m’lady, you’re clear to carry on,” I heard one of the voices say.

“Oh not you,” she said, and pointed out of the carriage, “him, yes you. Come over here.”

She pushed open the door of the carriage, and I could see a guard in mail armour with a long rune carved staff held in both hands approach.

“Yes m’lady?” Asked the man, a little unsure, he seemed younger than the first voice.

Chypia waved a hand in my direction, and I looked back to the man to see him pointing the staff at me. The soldier spoke what sounded an awful lot like an incantation.

*Oh fuck.*

There was a beat, as I looked between Chypia and the guard, trying to mask my sudden sheer terror with confusion.

“He’s no Mage m’lady, will that be all?”

*What?*

“Yes thank you,” and she shut the door, the carriage continuing into the city.

“How did you get the stick? I thought that Admypia didn’t use magic,” I probed.

“We use magic, or at least we use mages,” she said somewhat quietly, not looking at me.

*Sore subject? Hmmm.*

“Just be glad you’re not a Mage yourself,” she finished.

“Is it that much worse to be a Mage-slave than a normal slave? Slavery already seems pretty awful all on its own,” I said, well aware of my current predicament.

She gave me a dark look, “It is worse, there are rules for slaves like you,” and she put emphasis on the word ‘rules’, “There are no rules for how Mages are to be treated. Even a noble is not immune, if they are found to be a Mage then they are truly damned. They are taken from their family and auctioned off like any other chattel.”

I didn’t really have a good response for that, and we spent the rest of the journey in silence.

-----

About half an hour after washing up on the beach I found myself standing in front of a large and opulent manor. *Fat lot of good my ‘escape’ did me.* It wasn’t quite walled, but there was a sort of built up foundation that raised the rest of the manor up off of street level by about five feet. The area around the raised foundation was cleared, and despite being in the city there was quite a bit of green. Likely the small park and the raised platform were meant to set the manor apart from the rest of the city in the way that a wall might have. The manor itself had two wide wings, in a sort of reverse ‘U’ shape, leaving a large open space in between that looked rather like a private garden. All in all it looked rather nice, but my appreciation of the scenery was rather dampened- *get it?* -by the chafing of my still soaked clothes. Oh, and also the whole slavery thing. I was still fairly clumsy with fatigue, and my wet shoes and socks only made things worse. It was like trying to walk around with mallets for feet, and Chypia seized upon the opportunity to continue her ‘conversion’ of me.

“Here,” she said softly, taking my arm and helping me up the steps, “We’ll get you out of those wet clothes and all dried off.”

The two female guards followed close at hand, but slightly behind. I could feel their eyes on me, and resolved to wait to attempt escape until they weren’t anywhere nearby. Chypia lead me into the manor, calling for some of her servants. I was whisked upstairs to a room with a large steaming tub and found myself rather flustered when two tiny elven servants, they had copper cuffs similar to the driver’s, started to try to undress me.

I coughed, “Whoa! Excuse me?” I said, trying to keep one of them from pulling down my jeans and the other from trying to pull of my shirt.

“Is there a problem?” Asked Chypia, leaning into the room.

The two girls giggled, “He’s a little shy,” one of them said.

“Oh, would you prefer boys to bathe you?” Chypia teased.

“Oh he’s turning pink,” said the other girl.

*I might be slightly more interested in this if I had a choice in the matter, it’s not like these two aren’t attractive*

“I-I think I can manage to bathe myself th-thank you,” I stammered out.

The two serving girls looked at Chypia for assent, still smiling, and Chypia pursed her lips as she eyed me.

“I can bathe myself, m’lady,” she asserted.

“I can bathe myself, m’lady,” I repeated.

She seemed to consider for a moment, before waving them out of the room. She gave me an incomprehensible look, and then closed the door.

*This makes me sick. I’d almost rather get beaten, at least I’d be able to understand that better. Don’t underestimate this lady, she might speak softly, that just means she’s going in for the deep psychological shit.*

I slipped into the bath, careful to keep my bandages out of the water, and I lay there for a while considering my options.

*There’s no way in hell it’s going to be as easy as walking out the front gates. If they enslave mages as a matter of course they’ve got to have some way to detect mages trying to escape the city with magic.*

I was rather lost in thought, when the door suddenly opened and one of the girls stepped in, I jumped a little, startled by the sudden intrusion.

“Oh you are so precious,” she said, “but I’m not here for you,” and she set some dry clothes by the door, scooped up my discarded clothes and left.

*Well there goes the rest of my things.*

-----


# Chapter 17

I got out of the bath a little while later, clean and dry, and I picked up the clothes left out for me. There was a silk tunic, the same light blue colour as Chypia’s dress had been, and it was belted with a green silk rope. I stepped out of the bathroom, and into the large and luxurious bedroom beyond. Chypia was sitting on the bed, and had what remained of my things laid out next to her on a towel. She patted the bed next to her, and I sat down rebelliously. It was like sitting down obediently, except I was thinking rebellious thoughts as I did it.

“I was just going through your things, some of its very interesting,” and she slipped a little closer to me as she picked up my four-colour pen, “Like this one, what is it?”

“It’s a pen,” I explained, “May I?”

She nodded, and I took the pen, showing her how it worked, “Mmm, coloured ink? And you need no inkwell, is this given as a gift to graduates of the university you attended?”

I looked at her questioningly, “Most of the universities here in Adympia or Nimre will give ornate fountain pens to graduates in mathematics or literature. They’re usually gold, but I’ve never seen this material before, what’s it called?”

“It’s plastic,” I said flatly, “And the pen was two dollars at the university book store.”

“Is two dollars a large sum of money?”

“Two dollars is about half what it costs for a gallon of milk or fresh baked loaf of bread,” I explained, trying not to be condescending.

“Oh,” she said, seeming a little disappointed, ”This? Is this also so inexpensive as to be commonplace?” She asked, holding up my watch.

“No, you can get cheap watches, but this is not one of them.”

“I’m impressed that it still works after your swim,” she said, watching the second hand tick along, “How accurate is it?”

“Not sure, but it’s accurate to within something like two or three seconds per day.”

“Mmm, I think I’ll let you have this back, along with your pen. It’s good to have a steward that’s punctual.”

I took the watch and the pen as she handed them to me, putting them both into a pocket on the tunic. My wrists were still sore and I didn’t want the bandage getting caught up in the hinges on the band of the watch.

“What about these?” She asked, holding up my rings. *If she knows a mage stone or a mana stone by sight…*

“This one,” I started, indicating the ring with the mana stones set into it, “Belonged to my grandmother. It’s not much to look at, I think the stones are just coloured quartz, but it’s one of the things that gets passed down so I’ve kept it.”

She seemed to buy that, and nodded for me to continue, “This one I made after I arrived, the stone is actually only a bit of glass, and the ring itself is made of Aluminum”

“Pure aluminum?” She asked, a little shocked.

“Yeah, it’s much more commonplace where I come from. The glass too, it’s clearer than anything I’ve seen here but it’s nothing special where I come from. Aluminum is actually how I financed my journey, I sold some of it back in Myra to pay for passage.”

She seemed to notice me sour as I thought of the captain I’d paid, “I told you Quinn, it’s not so bad when you get used to it. You’ll live in far more luxury serving me than you would working for some Rhonan lord.”

*You’re right, I’m pretty sure ‘getting used to it’ is how most people would explain Stockholm Syndrome.*

“These ones,” I said, trying to keep my expression from betraying my thoughts, “Are just wooden thumb rings meant for archery. They make it easier to draw a heavy bow, and prevent damage to the thumb.”

“Oh, what does a mathematician need with a bow?” She asked, *dammit.*

“Well, nothing. I’d only ever done it as a hobby, but this place is quite a lot more dangerous than Canada. I figured I might as well have some way to defend myself from bandits and the like.”

“And your bow is back on the ship you were so eager to leave?” She asked, most amused.

“Yeah. I suppose Enutur is going to try to sell it?” I asked.

“Perhaps, though I imagine that the Alkides family is going to lay some claim to it and the rest of your things to try to recoup the costs of trying to capture you.”

“Do the Adympians enslave every traveler that tries to pass through their lands? Seems like that would stifle trade rather a lot.”

“Not everyone, not even most people, with the right documents most people can travel through Adympia with no trouble. But then you’re not most people are you Quinn,” she said softly.

“So just all Outsiders then, I guess they don’t get fancy documents allowing them to pass unmolested?” I asked, not at all bitterly.

“Oh you can get the documents at any Adympian consulate before you cross the border. They’re just not worth anything, once the first families decided that they were willing to pay the fines and the bribes to enslave an Outsider whether they had papers or not, everyone started doing it.”

I had plenty to say on what I thought about that, but decided to remain quiet. All I’d end up doing is aggravating her. I was saved from needing to come up with some response though, as there was a knock at the door.

“Yes?” Asked Chypia.

The door opened slightly, and one of the servant girls from before poked her head in, “I got you the salve you asked for m’lady.”

“Ah, yes. Bring it over Aris,” she called.

Aris came into the room and in one hand she carried a jar, probably the salve, along with a damp cloth. In the other hand she carried a pair of gold cuffs.

“Do you want help with the bandages m’lady?” Asked Aris.

“No, you are dismissed,” she responded, and Aris bowed and left. I saw as she left that both of the guards from before were standing just outside the door.

“What is that?” I asked, nodding towards the jar. *Is it magic?*

“Hush,” she shushed me, “let me see your arm.”

She undid the bandages on both arms, revealing my injured wrists. Now that they’d stopped bleeding quite as much I could see the cuts more clearly, and they were a lot worse than I’d thought.

“Mmm, can’t have these leaving nasty scars on my new trophy,” she murmured as she rubbed the salve onto the wounds.

I inhaled sharply as the salve was applied, it stung like hell, but I could also see the wounds closing cleanly right before my eyes. *Damn. I need me some healing magic.* Once the wounds were done closing she took the damp cloth and cleaned off the excess salve. I examined my arms to find that there was absolutley no trace of any injury, no scar, no scab, not even any redness.

Then she snapped a cuff onto each wrist. *Be calm, play along. You can get these off later.*

Chypia touched my face leaning in a little close, “Isn’t that better?” she whispered.

“Yes.” I said, rather uncomfortably.

“Yes m’lady?” She prompted.

“Yes m’lady,” I recited, and I tried to keep from sighing.

“Mmm, I don’t think I like your eyes hidden behind these,” she said, tapping on my glasses.

I tensed up a little at that, and was not smooth enough to keep her from noticing, “You wanted me to be a steward right? I can’t do much without these, I can’t see well enough to read or write, and I might not be able to recognize you in a crowd.”

She seemed to think about it for a moment, looking into my eyes and not taking her hand from my face. Finally she spoke, “I suppose I’ll allow you to keep them for now.”

“What’s this then?” She asked, handing me the folding knife, still locked shut.

*A tempting opportunity.*

I flicked it open, “It’s a knife,” I said, just as quietly as she’d been speaking.

This time she froze. I guess she hadn’t checked through my things very well, and she seemed suddenly aware of just how substantial the size difference was.

“Would you like this back, m’lady?” I asked, looking her right in the eye.

She held out an open hand, though didn’t speak, and I placed the knife into her hand.

“The other one is a knife too, though it also has a few other things, pliers, scissors, that sort of thing.”

“I think I understand,” she said, as she stood up, bundling up the towel and taking my things with her, “The girls will bring you dinner in an hour or so. Rest, and in the morning I will explain your duties to you.

She left, and as soon as the door closed I padded over as quickly and quietly as possible. I put my ear to the door and listened. I didn’t hear any eye opening conversation between Chypia and her guards, but I did hear three sets of footsteps walking away. I considered bolting immediately, but I was pretty sure that I would only get one shot at this. I didn’t know enough about how Adympia kept track of their slaves to risk a run for the gate, and the cuffs were kind of a giveaway if I tried to talk my way out. Basic Illusion was also out of the question until I could determine what kind of countermeasures they had in place over the gates to stop exactly the sort of thing I wanted to try.

I sat back down on the bed, and examined the cuffs. They were both gold, which I supposed was some rank of status. *Something something small favours.* And I was fairly sure that they were solid gold, though the cuffs weren’t very thick. There was silk padding on the inside of the cuffs, though these would still start to chafe eventually.

*I could get through these things with a metal file in rather short order.*

*Unless these are magic too… Do I cast Detect Magic on them?* It was risky, on the one hand they might carry an enchantment to start setting off alarms if someone tried to magic them, but on the other hand they might need to check up on any magical enchantments that might exist. I decided to risk it, perhaps foolishly, but I figured that they’d only put the magical countermeasures on restraints meant specifically for mages. As far as I knew mages were rare, and probably rarer in Adympia since most mages with any mobility would get the hell out as quickly as possible, so they probably *hopefully* wouldn’t be throwing complicated enchantments on every damn thing.

*Assuming that sort of enchantment is substantially more complicated than an enchantment that just makes these tougher.*

I went for it, casting Detect Magic, and I’d be lying if I said that I wasn’t hiding next to the door, waiting for the guards to burst in and beat me half to death.

They didn’t, which was nice.

But my antics distracted me as the spell went off, and had to recast the damn thing to actually get the reading on the cuffs. The cuffs were magical, and the spell informed me that the type of magic was ‘Abjuration’, but the spell didn’t give me any idea of the magnitude of the enchantment.

*No  ‘Detection’ or any detecty sounding words, so I guess I’m safe?*

This did mean that stealing a metal file from a blacksmith might not be the solution though. Adympia as a whole had probably seen most things tried, though being a mage on the loose was probably an advantage.

*I still don’t know why their little detector didn’t work. Maybe it checks someone’s mana level, mine is abysmal afterall.*

-----

I waited for Pasa to bring along my dinner, and went over my The Great Escape plan. First, I needed the cuffs off. They were apparently enchanted, but there had to be some limit. Hopefully I’d still be able to get through these things with enough effort. I’d still try to get my hands on a metal file, even just to test the durability of these things. Second, I needed to figure out what, if any, countermeasures existed on the gates out of the city. *Or I try to get out through the harbour? I’ll need to check that too.* Third, I needed to get the hell damned out of here. There were probably more steps, I just had no idea what they’d be yet.

I poked around the bedroom, hoping to find convenient secret passages or hidden caches of supplies left by secret abolitionists to aid my escape. Didn’t find anything like that unfortunately. I was only on the second floor though, and I was fairly sure that I’d be able to tie together enough of the bedsheets and the curtains to get me to the ground. I might even be able to jump if I was in a hurry, though I’d rather not have my escape attempt cut short by a pair of broken legs. There wasn’t much else in the way of escape materials, though there were some books. It did look like they were meant mostly for show, and as far as I could tell none of the spines had been cracked, but I picked through them anyway until I found something to help pass the time.

-----

There was a knock on the door an hour or so later, “Enter,” I called.

The two servants from before entered, *Pasa and Aris?* bearing trays with fancy covered dishes. I was sitting at the desk in the room, reading the book I’d found and I pushed it aside to give them room to set down the trays. They lifted off the covers, and oh dear god, the food was amazing. There was a steak, an actual steak, and there might have been some vegetables, but I was distracted by the steak. To go along with the steak was a tall glass of what looked and smelled like beer which was a nice touch, though I’d never really been very fond of beer. I cut into the steak and took a bite, it was a little rarer than I usually got my steak, but it was still fantastic.

*If Chypia is trying to convert me then this isn’t a bad way to do it, I’ve not eaten this well since I arrived here. Hell, I don’t remember the last time I had a steak this good back on Earth.*

“Are you pleased?” one of them asked eagerly, *Pasa I think? Whatever, she’s the green one.*

“Do you like it?” asked the other, equally as eager, *Aris? The blue one?* at nearly the same time.

“Yes, thank you,” I reassured them.

They didn’t seem to take this as the hint to leave though, and they still seemed to be waiting for something.

“Is there something else?” I asked of them.

“Lady Chypia wanted us to ask you which of us you liked best,” asked Pasa.

I raised an eyebrow at this, “What do you mean?” I asked, unsure where this was going.

They both started to speak, stumbling over each other, before Pasa let Aris take the lead, “Lady Chypia said that you’re to be her new steward, and that you should have your own servant. You can have whichever of us you like.”

*Make me more comfortable with the concept of slavery by giving me my own slave? Clever I suppose.*

“And just what is it you’d be doing for me?” I asked, I hadn’t needed a slave so far, and I didn’t feel like I needed one now.

“Anything,” and the way she said anything make me feel like I needed a smoke, or maybe a cold shower.

*Whoa, okay Quinn. Calm down a little.*

“Oh he’s turning pink again!” Said Pasa, which set them both to giggling.

I sighed, “Aren’t you both slaves? I thought there were rules, can she make you do that sort of, uh, anything?” I asked about as awkwardly as humanly possible.

“No, she can’t punish us for disobeying that sort of instruction, but she can reward us for being such obedient servants,” Aris explained, still grinning.

I looked between the two of them, and they both seemed eager and willing, but as far as I was concerned they’d been coerced into this situation. Taking advantage of Chypia’s psychological control over the two of them would be as wrong as taking one of them by force. I’d probably have to pick one of them though, otherwise Chypia would probably just assign one of them to me. The two seemed somewhat similar in build, and were the same height as Chypia herself. *She probably doesn’t like servants that are much taller than her.* They also had the same generous proportions that Chypia had, though none of them came close to Thera. Aris was very blue, with pastel blue hair and sapphire eyes. Even her skin seemed a touch blue, though it didn’t make her look unhealthy. Pasa on the other hand was very green, with pastel green hair and emerald eyes. Pasa’s skin was also very slightly green. Despite the odd colouring they both seemed to be city elves, even Pasa’s hair didn’t quite seem like the wood elf shade of green.

*Dye job? But who dyes someone’s skin? That’s one hell of a way to display ownership of a person though, and Chypia does seem fond of blue and green. Shame that neither of them is red.*

I sighed, I was doing a lot of that lately, “You then,” I said, nodding towards Aris.

Pasa looked a little crestfallen, but Aris jumped up, arms up in the air as if she’d just won some contest.

“Yes! Now shoo, shoo,” Aris said, as she swept Pasa out of the room.

I watched the antics as I ate my steak, not sure what I’d need to contend with once I was alone with Aris. Thankfully I didn’t get leapt on immediately, but she hovered by my elbow, eyeing me as I ate.

“Aris,” I started.

“Yes Quinn?” She asked, somehow making Quinn into a title.

“Is there something you’re waiting for?” I asked, looking at her out out of the corner of my eye as I ate.

“I’m waiting upon you, Quinn.”

I had to make a conscious effort not to sigh heavily again.

“Why don’t you take a seat,” I invited.

“Ah…”

“Is there a problem?” I asked.

“Servants don’t usually sit while their charge is eating,” she explained.

“There’s no one else here Aris, you can sit.”

She seemed a little unsure, but she eventually took a seat on the footrest for one of the chairs in the room.

“Is Chypia, Lady Chypia,” I corrected myself, I wasn’t yet sure how loyal she was, “Aware that I might not exactly be familiar with all of the social customs of Adympia?”

“Yes, that’s one of the things that she said I’d need to help you with.”

“Oh, and what else does she think I’ll need your help with?” I probed.

“I’m supposed to help you get used to your new duties, learn the rules of etiquette, teach you about all the different Adympian families and their relationships with Lady Chypia, and…” She said, with a small smile,” I’m supposed to make you feel more comfortable.”

*I wasn’t aware that you could delegate seduction.*

“Oh you’re turning pink again!” She cheered.

I just shook my head.

“Oh no,” she said, her eyes suddenly wide, putting a hand to her mouth, “Have you never been with a woman before?”

*Oh for fucks sake.*

“That is not- argh- that’s not really- forget it,” I stammered out, “Why don’t you tell me about what forks I should be using.”

-----

Aris spent some time explaining the ‘rules’ to me, and I did my best to pay attention. I really hoped that I wouldn’t be here long enough to need the information, but I also wanted to get on Chypia’s good side. If I could get her to trust me enough to let me leave her little palace without a guard to escort me then I’d be most of the way to escaping already. Eventually the hour grew late, and it came time to go to sleep.

This made things rather awkward.

“Please, what have I done to disappoint you Quinn?” Aris asked, hands clasped infront of her, eyes downcast.

She’d laid out some Quinn sized silk pyjamas, though she called them nightclothes, but things had gone kind of downhill from there. She’d started by trying to undress me, which was apparently entirely normal, I guess that Adympia nobles were too lazy to dress and undress themselves. I managed to keep her hands off of me, but then she climbed into my bed, waiting for me to change. It was when I told her to get out of my room so I could sleep that the real problem started. When I’d first told her to leave she looked at me like I’d just slapped her across the face, she’d gotten out of my bed, but stopped in front of me to ask her question.

“You haven’t done anything wrong Aris,” I said, a little impatiently, “But I just want to sleep, and not do anything else with you.”

Her head fell further, “Do you want me to go get Pasa for you?” she asked quietly, seeming somehow ashamed.

*I probably could have phrased that better.*

“That’s not what I meant, Aris. I want to sleep alone, it doesn’t matter if it’s you or Pasa or anyone else. That’s why I want you to leave.”

That wasn’t strictly true. I didn’t want to sleep alone, and I rather did like the idea of sleeping with Aris, but the whole situation still just made me feel sick. If not for Enutur I would have been landing in Nimre this time tomorrow night, or early the morning after. Instead, I was stuck in a bedroom that may as well have been a prison, inside a manor that was just a slightly larger prison, and all that was in a city, that was all just one damn big prison.

“But, I didn’t mean to offend you Quinn,” still making Quinn sound like a title, “And I’m very sorry, but will you please let me sleep tonight?”

“Aris,” I started, hesitating, “I’m not trying to punish you, I just want to sleep alone. Don’t you have your own room?”

“No, normally Pasa and I sleep in Lady Chypia’s room, but she’s already picked a new Lady’s Servant from the house staff.”

“Uh, and, uh, do they normally sleep in Lady Chypia’s bed?” I asked, getting very interesting ideas.

*Maybe I* ***should*** *try this whole slavery thing.*

Aris looked up at me through her hair, and I could see that she was raising an eyebrow sceptically.

“I’m just asking, I didn’t mean anything by it,” I said, raising my hands.

She smiled a little, and I was pretty sure that I’d started blushing again, “Our Lady sometimes expects us to warm up her bed for her, but we normally sleep in the servant’s bed.”

“In her room?” I asked, looking around for something similar in my bedroom, but coming up empty.

Aris walked over and pulled out a large drawer from the side of my own bed. It had a matress inside of it, “Don’t they have these where you come from?” she asked.

“No, and we don’t really have servants where I come from either,” I said.

“You don’t? Then who does all the cooking, and cleaning? Who washes the dishes and does the laundry?” She asked, seeming sceptical.

“Well we’ve got machines for the dishes and laundry. If someone doesn’t really want to cook then they can order food brought to their house, I guess cleaning is the only thing? But even then, we’ve got machines to make that much easier too,” I said, wishing I could order a pizza at that moment.

“Are they magic machines?” She asked, even more sceptical than before.

“No, just normal machines,” I said, looking at the little pull-out bed she was standing beside.

“Um, is it going to be okay if I sleep here?” She asked, seeing my look, “I promise to be really really quiet.”

I sighed, “Yeah, I guess.”

*Looks like I’ve got a servant and a chaperone now. That does rather complicate my escape plans. Damn, am I going to have to bring her with me when I leave?*

# Chapter 18

I was standing in the doorway to the library, leaning on the doorframe, watching Quinn work. I’d told him what I expected of him, but I wasn’t quite prepared to handle what I’d unleashed when I showed him some of my ledgers. He initially seemed confused when he started flipping through them, and I was worried that he wasn’t quite as learned as I’d thought, but then confusion turned to anger, and anger turned to disgust.

He began some sort of explanation about something called ‘positional numbering systems’ while he started to pull out the rest of my ledgers and flip through them. This might have been the first steward or scribe I’d ever had that approached accounting with such fervour. I couldn’t understand half of what he was saying, but wasn’t about to let him know that so I nodded along with him, letting him know that I had other business to handle and that I’d check in on him later.

At some point between then and now he’d roped in both of my scribes, and seemed to be browbeating the two of them into learning his new numbering symbols. Whether I understood what he was saying or not, it was impressive to watch. The more I heard him speak, especially to the other servants, the more I came to the conclusion that he was not some simple merchant’s son. It was like watching a nobleman holding court, or a general briefing his officers.

He’d found a chalkboard somewhere, and was gibbering something about “The concept of zero” while the two scribes looked on with an expression that made me think they doubted Quinn’s sanity. Oh, and poor Aris. She was sitting in a chair near Quinn with her knees pulled up to her chest, and she had a very wide-eyed expression as her gaze darted between Quinn and his chalkboard. She was a dear, but if I had a hard time understanding what Quinn was going on about then Aris was truly lost.

Quinn’s self-confidence and commanding attitude was an asset in a steward, I certainly didn’t want to spend my time micromanaging the servants, but the same commanding attitude that made him a good steward made him a bad toy. It was the same dilemma I had with his body, he was a huge and delicious piece of meat, but if he decided that he didn’t want me ‘playing’ with him then there wouldn’t be much I could do to stop him from hurting me.

This was why I’d set Aris the task of taming him. If Quinn had his own toys to play with then he might be a little bit more grateful in the future. It was always a slow process to convert a new slave to my side, but it was always more rewarding to make a slave **want** to obey, than it was to beat them into submission. Pasa and Aris were proof of that, it had taken years to meld them into the slaves they were today, but I’d never have been able to get results anything like this if I’d tried more brutal methods. It was much the same with Quinn, there was no point in trying to whip him into submission, when I wanted a giant sized plaything to hold me close in the middle of the night.

I caught Aris’s eye, and motioned her over. I’d need a report of how well she did last night, and I wanted the juicy details. Aris excused herself, though I don’t think Quinn even noticed her get up, and I shut the door so we could speak without being overheard.

I could tell just from her expression that she had not done well. She had her head down, hair hiding her eyes, clearly ashamed.

“Explain yourself Aris,” I said sternly, though not harshly, “This should not have been that difficult.”

“I’m sorry m’Lady, I don’t know what happened. I tried, I tried my best, I promise. I even tried making him feel guilty, I told him that I didn’t have anywhere else to sleep.”

“That is clever,” I said pleased, and Aris beamed at the complement, “didn’t it work?”

“No m’Lady, I ended up sleeping in the servant’s bed. I’m sorry,” she said, apologetically.

“Aris, hmmm, you really tried everything?” I asked, and she nodded, “I don’t want you to think you’re worth any less than Pasa, but do you think that she might have better luck?”

“Maybe, but I even asked him if he wanted me to send Pasa in when I was trying to make him feel guilty,” I smiled, she’d learned better even than I’d thought, “but he just told me that he didn’t want to sleep with anyone.”

I frowned, “Aris, do you think…” I trailed off, what good would Quinn be as a toy if-

“No m’Lady, I saw the way he looked at Pasa and I. He wants us, I just can’t get him to act on it.”

“Hmm, this isn’t usually so difficult. Normally you don’t have any trouble getting new conquers to jump right on top of you,” I considered, this was definitely not going to be easy.

“I know, I’m sorry m’Lady. What do you want me to do instead?”

“Well either I send Pasa along with you next time, or we start slow, and work our way up,” I said, thoughtfully.

“It might be best to start slow, I don’t think we’ll have any more luck if we’re both trying to get him into bed. He’d probably just push us away like he had when we were first going to help him bathe.”

“Alright, well I leave it in your capable hands then Aris,” I said, patting her cheek.

“Yes m’Lady,” she said, a bit more cheerful now.

I shooed her along, and she returned to tending to Quinn. I growled once she was gone, bringing one closed hand down on the shelf next to me.

“Dammit!” *This is going to take ages. Maybe I should just have a valet buy me some silk rope.*

-----

I spent the rest of the day curled up in the chair, watching Quinn try to teach the others his new numbering system. He didn’t seem to be getting through to them, especially since Erilon seemed insulted when Quinn said that his numbers were better than Erilon’s numbers.

“I’ve been serving our Lady for over sixty years, you’ve been here for only two days and you think you know this material better than we do?” Erlion said angrily.

“It takes weeks to just learn these ledgers well enough to know what they contain,” Cusole cut in.

“That’s probably because the numbering system you use is nearly incomprehensible. If you’d been using this numbering system since the start,” Quinn said, pointing at the chalkboard where he’d written several strange symbols, “Any scribe could sit down with these ledgers and understand Lady Chypia’s accounts immediately.”

Erlion and Cusole started talking at the same time, and then they started shouting and I just curled up in the chair, making myself as small as possible. Quinn never did raise his voice, but he was clearly as angry as the other two. The three of them argued until lunch time, when Lady Chypia finally broke them up by telling Quinn to come to lunch with her.

-----

Pasa and I brought lunch out for Quinn and Lady Chypia. Our Lady was enjoying a glass of wine, but Quinn had insisted on water for himself.

“So it’s…” Quinn was saying, “Emperor, King, Duke, Marquis, Count, Baron, and Knight? Unless Adympia also has Archdukes, Viscounts and Baronets.”

“That’s very good,” praised Lady Chypia, “Though I’m not familiar with those last three titles.”

“Archdukes are between Kings and Dukes, I think only the Holy Roman Empire ever had Archdukes though. Viscounts are between Counts and Barons I think, not sure about that one, but I’m pretty sure the title was never hereditary. And the Baronets are below Barons, and I think that the only way that they were different from knights was that they weren’t expected to be personally involved in warfare.”

“I’m impressed,” Lady Chypia said while smiling, and I was suddenly a little jealous of Quinn, “Was this all a part of your education Quinn?”

“Not exactly,” said Quinn, with a wry smile as Pasa and I set out the food for the two of them.

Lady Chypia gave Quinn a questioning look and Pasa and I stood aside, to wait on their needs.

“Ah, Crusader Kings Two,” said Quinn, “It’s a sort off… training… game. It’s hard to explain, but it teaches the management of feudal dynasties.”

“Is it like Zatrikion?” Lady Chypia asked.

“Yeah,” answered Quinn, “Though it’s rather more complicated than Zatrikion.”

“You know how to play Zatrikion?”

“Yeah, and fairly well too.”

“Hmm, I’ll have to see about that once we’re done with our lunch. You had asked about Ventia though, this is Marquis Volinio’s capital city. The land he controls is only the size of a county, but it’s considered a March since it’s on the border.”

“Didn’t you mention that you’re related somehow to the Marquis?”

“Yes, my father was his cousin.”

“Doesn’t that put you somewhere in the line of succession?” Asked Quinn, he seemed surprisingly interested.

“In Adympia women only have a place in the line of succession if there are no viable male heirs available. Marquis Ventia has no sons, but he had another cousin, and that cousin had a son. He, Nusalvo, is the current heir, at least until the Marquis has a son of his own,” Lady Chypia was explaining.

Quinn had been sketching something on a piece of parchment, and he turned it so our Lady could see it.

“Like this?” He asked, and Lady Chypia nodded, “So then only these ones,” he said, pointing at some of the circles near the root of the tree like drawing, “Are all dead then?”

“Yes, why do you ask?” she asked.

“Well, I was just wondering how healthy Nusalvo is. I mean, is he a fan of any risky hobbies? Does he have any enemies?” Quinn asked, and my eyes got wider and wider as he spoke.

Lady Chypia blinked, “Are you- You don’t waste any time do you?”

“I’m only asking,” Quinn said, raising his hands, “It’s entirely reasonable to worry about the health of the heir to the realm.”

“Is that what you’re doing? You’re not considering anything else?” Lady Chypia asked wryly.

“Of course not, what could you possibly mean?” Asked Quinn, then his expression changed to shock, “Why Lady Chypia,” he said, taken aback, “Are you seriously suggesting what I think you’re suggesting? I can’t believe that you’d be so cold. Count me in, I’ve got a few ideas myself.”

Lady Chypia looked at me and Pasa for some sort of support, she seemed barely able to believe what she was hearing.

“Unless you’re on good terms with your, second cousin? Not sure what the term would be,” Quinn said.

Lady Chypia’s expression grew dark, *oh Tila…* “No. I most certainly am not.”

Quinn seemed a little surprised at the change in attitude, but seemed to take it in stride, “Is this the sort of conversation we’d want to have somewhere else?” He asked, “Though I’m guessing that these two,” he gestured at us, “can be trusted on this matter?”

“You’re right about Pasa and Aris, but this is something we will speak on at a later time,” Lady Chypia said, the thought of her sister had clearly shaken her, “Enjoy your meal Quinn.”

Lady Chypia stood up, leaving most of her meal uneaten. Pasa glanced at me before leaving with her. Lady Chypia likely didn’t want to cry in front of Quinn.

Quinn looked to me, seeming a little worried, “Should I not have suggested…” he trailed off.

“No, no. It’s not that. Once m’Lady gathers herself I don’t think she’s going to waste any time asking all about your idea, but it’s a sore subject for her,” I explained.

“What do you mean? Was she close once with the man?” Quinn asked.

“No, well, they never really saw each other…” I trailed off, I wasn’t sure how much I was supposed to tell Quinn. Playing on his sympathy seemed to be the best way to ‘convert’ him as Lady Chypia wanted, so I went ahead and told him, “They never really saw much of each other, until it started to become clear that the Marquis wasn’t going to have a son. Once Lord Nusalvo realized that he was going to be the heir, he started to consolidate his position. That mostly meant making sure that Lady Chypia didn’t do something to get a better claim, or do something to make him not eligible.”

“I thought women couldn’t inherit unless there were no men in line?” Quinn asked.

“Well no, but Lady Chypia said it’s almost never that simple. She said that if you say you’re the Marquis, and everyone thinks you’re the Marquis, it wouldn’t matter Lord Nusalvo was technically the heir,” I explained, trying to remember what Lady Chypia had told me.

“So Lord Nusalvo started trying to make sure Lady Chypia couldn’t swoop in and take the March away from him. What is it he did to Lady Chypia?”

“Well, I say he was trying to stop Lady Chypia from taking the March away. But that’s not quite how it happened,” I took a breath, “Lady Chypia is the younger sister, Concia is the older sister.”

Quinn seemed to understand, “And as Lord Nusalvo was digging around for dirt on his competition, he managed to find out the secret that the then Lady Concia had been hiding, that she was a Mage.”

“Yes,” I said in a small voice.

“I don’t mean to blame Lady Chypia, but couldn’t she have just bought her sister back?” Quinn asked.

“No, when someone finds out that a noble is a Mage, their family isn’t allowed to make a bid on them. Owning any Mage is a mark of prestige for a noble, but owning a Mage that was once a noble themselves? It makes it pretty clear which family is the greater, especially when a noble can do whatever they like to a Mage. So after Concia was enslaved, Nusalvo made sure to win the auction, and he likes to remind our Lady of just what he has her sister doing for him whenever he can,” just talking about it made me sick, I could only imagine how Lady Chypia felt right now.

“So,” he started, “sounds like I’ve got an assassination **and** a rescue to plan.”

-----

I woke up in the library, to find it completely empty. I was laying on the couch with a pillow under my head, and a couple of blankets covering me. Quinn had packed up all the books he’d been reading and gone to bed it seemed. I looked at the clock, it was nearly ten at night, and we’d been here since Quinn finished lunch. I guess I’d fallen asleep at some point, and Quinn had done his best to make me comfortable. I sat up, pushing the blankets aside. I still had work to do on him, and I wanted to get him used to me sleeping in the same room as him. Hopefully I’d be able to work up to the same bed at some point.

I padded though the quiet halls of Lady Chypia’s manor, everyone else had already gone to bed, until I found Quinn’s room. I put an ear to the door, and could hear someone moving around. I opened the door quietly, hoping to catch Quinn of guard by walking in while he was half dressed. His hair was still wet from the bath, and he didn’t have a shirt on and seemed to be trying to stretch out his back, I appreciated the show. He looked up when he saw me, but didn’t seem embarrassed by his undress, *damn.*

“I guess you’re not going to let me get away with letting you sleep on the couch,” he said, sighing.

“I’m supposed to take care of you Quinn,” I said sweetly, as I walked up close to him, “What if you wanted something in the middle of the night? You’d have to get up and find it yourself, or find another servant to get it for you.”

“Well, I am rather used to doing those sorts of things for myself,” he said grimacing, as he rolled one of his shoulders.

“Well, now you don’t need to do everything for yourself. Are you okay? Is there anything I can do to help,” I asked hopefully, clasping my hands in front of myself. Being this close to him, I could really appreciate why Lady Chypia was so interested. I thought she was taking a risk with someone so much larger than her, but standing in his shadow, I felt a pleasant little flutter in my stomach.

“It’s fine,” he said, “Just be glad you’re not so tall, my back aches all the time, and my joints aren’t much better.”

“Oh!” I exclaimed, “I can help, you just lay down on the bed,” and I started to push him back towards the big bed.

“Whoa, hold on there,” he said, gently pushing me back, “It’s not that you’re not beautiful Aris, because you are,” I might have turned a little bluer at that, “But I’m still not really comfortable with the arrangement you seem to be suggesting.”

I sighed and looked down dejectedly, trying to earn as many sympathy points as possible, “Well, I can still help a little then I guess. Just a massage, not anything else, I promise. Would that be okay?”

He still seemed unsure, but nodded, “Okay. But you be careful where you put your hands,” he warned, though he was smiling a little.

I got him down onto the bed, and climbed up onto his back. There was a lot of Quinn laid out on that bed, and I set to work. He seemed to be making an effort to remain quiet, but I managed to get some contented groans out of him. I didn’t blame him, his back muscles were all tense and knotted up, and I took as much time as I could kneading and rubbing with my hands. I was worried that I’d find myself back in the servants bed once I was done, but It turned out that I didn’t need to worry. I was in the middle of going over his back for a second time, just to drag things out as much as possible, when I noticed that I’d put him right to sleep.

I smiled, *perfect.*

I was very careful, pulling the blankets up over his back, and slipping under his arm. I was lying there quietly trying to get to sleep despite my quickly beating heart, I was worried that he might be angry if he woke to find me in bed with him, when he moved. I thought he was about to toss me out of bed, but instead he rolled onto his side a little, pulling me in close. My face was right up against his chest, and very carefully I slipped one of my arms around him, snuggling in. I could tell that he was still sleeping, just moving to get more comfortable, and I relaxed into him. He was so warm, and I fell asleep right there in his arms.

# Chapter 19

Quinn

-----

I woke to sound of birds chirping outside, and I could feel a small, lithe form curled up against my chest.

“Mmm, Thera?” I murmured sleepily.

“Who’s Thera?”

I started awake, and looked down to see that it was Aris curled up against me.

“I thought I was rather clear about where certain people would be sleeping,” I said reproachfully.

“Well you just looked so peaceful, I didn’t want to disturb you after I’d done so much work to get you relaxed,” she said in a sweet voice.

“That sounds like a really terrible excuse,” I said wryly.

“What? Well if you don’t want me in bed with you then what’s this prodding me in the leg?” she taunted, and I had to move very quickly when she reached down to try grab it.

“Hey! Hey! Out! Out! I’m sure you have breakfast to bring me or something,” I said, voice a little higher than it normally was.

“You’re no fun,” she said, as she slipped out of the bed.

She got dressed, right in the middle of the room, and I’d be lying if I said that I didn’t watch with interest. She gave me a knowing look as she left the room, and I got out of bed and walked to the bathroom. *Is there a god of indoor plumbing?* I ran the bath, and took my time shaving and washing. I hadn’t heard Aris come back into the room, so I lay there for a while in the hot water, enjoying the solitude. I hadn’t been able to have very much time to myself since the Banestorm dropped me off. I’d been getting better about being around other people, it had been a necessity since arriving in Essens, but it still felt draining to be around others nearly every second of every day. I thought it would be bad enough with Aris sleeping in the same room, not only would it make planning my escape difficult, but it also meant that moments of solitude were even harder to come by. But now I find that she wasn’t going to settle for simply sleeping near my bed. It was almost suffocating, and that was before I even considered the fact that, oh yeah, I was a slave.

*If I can kill Nusalvo and free Concia I’ll do it, but priority one is get the fuck out of here.*

I looked at my watch.

*June-24, so… 175 days since I arrived. I should have been arriving in Nimre right about now. I’ve still got roughly eighty days until the deadline, I can do this.*

There was a knock on the door that jerked me back to reality, and I got out of the bath to dry off.

-----

I had breakfast in my room, with Aris, who apperantly wasn’t going to let me out of her sight for very long. I spent the morning going over Lady Chypia’s ledgers, copying them from the pseudo-Roman numerals into a more sane decimal notation. The hardest part was deciphering the damned things, it wasn’t as simple as a column of numbers, and it took some work to figure out what the hell each number was supposed to be so I could copy it out properly into a fresh ledger.

Chypia came in a little before lunch to see how I was doing, I think that Cusole and Erlion might have complained to her. She stood beside me, one hand on the back of my chair. Even sitting down as I was, we were at eye level.

“My scribes tell me that you’re destroying years of financial records,” she said with a smile.

I sighed, “It’s not my fault if they’re wed to a numbering system that’s ancient, cumbersome, inefficient, inconvenient, unmanageable, awkward, and slow.”

“Is that all?” She asked, raising an eyebrow?

“I’ve been making a list,” I said wryly, “But I’m not destroying anything. Their awful ledgers are still right here,” and I pointed to the massive stack of books piled on the table next to me, “I’m simply copying them out, up to the past year. There’s something like sixty years of records here, and there’s not a whole lot of point in duplicating them all, but all the most recent ledgers will actually be readable once I’m done.”

“And you prefer this way of writing numbers?” She asked, seeming unconvinced.

“No, it’s not a matter of preference. This way is better, objectively better. Cusole, or Erilon, I can’t remember, it was one of them, said that these ledgers would take weeks to sort out, like it was some point of pride. With this numbering system anyone with basic numeracy skills could understand what’s written here.”

I glance up to find that she was looking at me with an amused expression, “What?” I asked.

“I’ve just never seen someone be so passionate about numbers before,” she said, and I was sure that she was trying not to laugh.

“Why don’t I show you what I mean, it should take no time at all.”

She nodded, “Alright,” and she pulled over a chair to sit beside me.

I was true to my word, and by the time lunch arrived for the two of us Chypia seemed to grasp the idea of a positional number system, and promised that she’d instruct Cusole and Erilon to assist me in switching over her ledgers to my new system. We set the books aside to eat lunch, and Chypia continued her explanation of local Adympian politics. I’d originally been thinking of it as a country, or even a feudal empire, but neither of those were quite correct. Neither was it a centrally managed empire like ancient Rome. It was much more like the Holy Roman Empire, which despite the name was neither Holy, Roman, or an Empire. The member lords of the… *Holy Adympian Empire?* did answer to someone calling themselves an emperor, much like member lords of the Holy Roman Empire did. But much like the Holy Roman Empire the Adympian lords were semi-autonomous. It was basically a medieval European Union, which made sense considering the amount of territory that Adympia covered. It was about the same size as Russia, and trying to manage an empire of that size when your fastest way of sending orders was a guy on horseback would be nearly impossible. Eventually though, the conversation turned back towards her cousin, *second cousin?* and what I might be planning to do away with him.

“I do not mean to insult you Quinn, but you do not strike me as an assassin. How exactly do you expect to kill Nusalvo?” she asked, having ensured that only Aris and Pasa would be in a position to overhear.

“I’m not going to kill him, I’m going to build the weapon that will do it. We’ll need someone else to actually use it, someone who’s not so recognizable as myself,” I explained.

“Quinn,” she began, “Nusalvo has a substantial staff of guardsmen, and other servants that will surely get in the way. I cannot imagine any weapon that would help one person overwhelm that much opposition.”

“Ah, but that’s the trick. Going through all that opposition is foolish, an attack would surely be noticed, and whoever sent would be killed. If we do things right, he won’t even know that he’s been attacked until it’s already too late.”

This definitely got Chypia’s attention, “And just how would that work?”

I pulled out a sheaf of paper from within my tunic, setting on the table, along with a wooden walking cane that I’d had leaning against the table. I flattened out the papers, some of which were covered in equations, with the others having a diagram of the weapon. Chypia looked over the papers with equal parts interest and confusion.

“Just what is this meant to be?” She asked.

“An air rifle,” I explained, “One built to fit inside of this cane, or one like it. It won’t be very powerful, and it will launch a needle instead of a bullet, but then it doesn’t need to be very powerful.”

“You expect to shoot him in the eye with this?” She asked, sceptically.

“Not quite, the needle will be coated in poison, and the shot will go into his leg. Done right, he might confuse the pain for a bee sting, or not even notice it if we can find some way to distract him suitably.”

“So you also know about poisons now?”

“The fruits of a misspent youth,” I said smiling.

“And youths where you come from normally learn all about poisons, do they?” She asked, amused.

“Well, not exactly. Remind me to tell you about the internet some time. The particular poison I have in mind should be locally available, relatively easy to manufacture in small quantities, and hopefully unknown.”

“And this poison is called?” She asked, I seemed to have her full attention now.

“Ricin, it’s made from castor beans and has no known antidote. Maybe Nusalvo has access to some magical healing, like the salve you used on my wrists the first night I was here, but Ricin is just about the most toxic natural poison that exists. It is somewhat slower acting, but to someone unfamiliar with the symptoms of Ricin poisoning, it will look like the victim fell ill suddenly. Granted, I imagine that there will be some suspicion, considering his position and how suddenly he would fall ill, but I think that handling the political side of things would probably be up to you.”

“Castor beans? I have heard of them used as a poison, but it requires the person to actually be tricked into eating the ground up seeds, and even then it’s not terribly reliable,” Chypia said, thoughtful, but also a little disappointed, “Have you really thought this through Quinn?”

“Yes, there are two issues with castor beans on their own that I plan to solve. The first is that the beans only have a small amount of poison each, and trying to get it to someone in the form of ground up beans is not very convenient. Instead, assuming I can get the right equipment, I can concentrate the poison. The second is that both the castor beans and the ricin are hard for the body to digest, which means that even if they eat it, they might not get a full dose. That’s the reason for the air gun, injection is much more reliable, and we don’t need to get someone in place to put the poison in his food. Assuming of course, he can’t just magic himself better, that’s the thing I’m not sure about.”

“If you did intend to put it in his food then yes, magic would be a problem, but if it’s being injected then there is not much that can be done to fix the damage,” She said. Her expression was dark, but I got the impression that she was getting a little excited.

“What do you mean?”

“There are enchantments that can be used to check food for poisons, which would detect the poison immediately. Nearly every noble in Adympia uses some version of the enchantment, I have Aris and Pasa check all the food they serve for example. They each carry a ring with the enchantment,” She said, nodding towards the two of them, “but magical healing is very limited. Flesh wounds and scars can be fixed, but any damage to the organs, lost limbs, or anything else that’s too complex can’t be healed with magic.”

*I’ll have to file that information away for later.*

I smiled, “Well if every noble is running around with poison detecting rings, then I bet there’s not been a whole lot of effort put into researching poisons.”

“No, and I’ve not heard of the use of poisoned weapons by anyone other than orc or goblin tribes. I’m pleased Quinn, this might work,” she praised.

“Well then, I’ve got a shopping list, do you have someone you can send out to get these things?” I asked, offering up the list.

I’d written the specifications of the parts I needed rather more technically than strictly necessary, if I’d done things right…

“I do, but some of these things seem rather specific. It might be best if collected these things yourself, Aris should be able to guide you around the city,” she said.

*Perfect, being able to move around the city should make planning my escape much easier.*

“Alright, this does leave the second objective unsolved though, and I’ll admit that I’ve not got many ideas.”

“You mean rescuing my sister,” she said quietly.

“Yeah, mainly it comes down to what happens once Nusalvo is dead. I guess you’d inherit all of his things? But then you’re not supposed to have possession of Concia, are you?”

“No, but there will be some leeway. The process of managing the inheritance should take a few days, so we might have some chance to work out… something,” the subject was clearly making her feel uncomfortable.

“Let me worry about that then, I’ve got some time to think about this.”

She stood, nodding. She pulled me into her chest, hugging me, “Thank you Quinn.”

-----

It took over a week to assemble all of the tools and equipment I’d need for my plan. Chypia had given me quite a substantial budget for the project, and I’d hoped to be able to just buy most of the parts I’d need. I didn’t have much luck though, and while I could get the materials in about the precision I wanted, I was going to end up making the parts myself. I’d set up my workshop on the first floor below my bedroom, and while I didn’t have a forge, I had just about every other metalworking tool, woodworking tool, and piece of chemistry equipment that I could get my hands on.

*We’re gonna need a…* ***montage.***


# Chapter 20

Lady Chypia

-----

“And he’s still not started with the poisons?” I asked Enes.

“No m’Lady, Aris might be able to explain it better since she’s been sitting and watching almost constantly, but nothing he’s made so far looks very much like a weapon either,” she said, stiffly as ever.

“I’m not disparaging your abilities Enes, but are you sure? He might be familiar with weapons that are entirely foreign to us, he is an outsider after all.”

“Yes, Aris and I have been keeping a close eye on him. I’ve made sure to go out with the two of them whenever Quinn leaves to gather more materials. Aris has also been with nearly every second of every day since she started serving him, and unless she’s told you differently he’s not been smuggling anything else in,” she reported, “We might just ask Quinn, he seems eager to show off the things he’s making, even if what he’s making doesn’t seem to make much sense to anyone but himself.

“Mmm, it’s about time I check on him myself anyways. Good work Enes,” I praised.

“Thank you m’Lady,” she replied, no less stiffly than before.

Enes fell in behind me as I went to check on Quinn.

-----

I stepped into the little workshop, and was rather amused by what I found. Aris was curled up on one of the chairs, peeking over the backrest and looking towards where Quinn was standing. He was facing towards the far end of the room where he’d set several of my ledgers on the shelf that ran along the wall, and he was holding a long tube to his mouth.

*My ledgers? What in the world…*

Quinn took a deep breath, then there was a hiss of air, and a ‘thwippp’ sound as a shiny bronze dart suddenly sprouted from the cover of one of my ledgers.

“Quinn…” I said quietly, “Are those my ledgers?”

He turned around quickly to see myself and Enes standing in the doorway, “I made a blowgun!” He said excitedly, “Want to try it Enes?”

I sighed, Enes was normally as stoic as a statue, but hand her a new toy and she turned into an excited little girl. She was grinning like an idiot as Quinn explained the weapon to her.

“You’ll want to take a deep breath before firing,” he was saying, “But don’t breathe in through the pipe, otherwise you’ll suck the dart into your mouth. Yeah, just like that. Hold it in both hands, level it at one of the targets…”

There was a hiss and a ‘thwippp’ and another dart sprouted from another ledger.

“I’m surprised,” Enes said, as the two walked up towards the ‘targets’ to inspect the damage, “This is much more powerful that you’d think, is there nothing else driving the dart forwards?” She pried out one of the darts, it was about three inches long and nearly half of its length had been buried in the ledger.

“Nope, just your breath. This isn’t even that big as blowguns are concerned. A really big blowgun might be six feet long, and it would fire six inch long darts. It’s still not very practical compared to something like a crossbow, but it’s about as quiet as any weapon can get.”

“And you plan to use this to deliver the poison?” Enes asked, “You’re right about how quiet it is, but standing in the middle of the street while pointing a three foot long tube at Nusalvo might draw attention.”

“Well, yeah, but I only made this to test how precise I could be with the tools and materials I’ve got. The barrel needs to be pretty uniform, and matched very closely to the width of the dart. If it’s off by too much then most of the air will just pass around the dart, and won’t drive it forwards. Now that I’ve got this sorted I can work on some way of storing air in a reservoir, so all it takes is for the user to open a valve, instead of holding it to their lips. This needs to be covert after all, ideally the weapon could be used in a crowd, by someone passing him on the street.”

“Lady Chypia mentioned that you wanted to do something like that, do you really think that would work? I find it hard to imagine not noticing one of these sticking out of my leg though,” Enes said, gesturing with the dart in her hand.

I leaned back against the wall, sighing, at least Enes seemed to be enjoying herself. Amas would be disappointed that her sister was the one to have all the fun.

“Well I’m actually basing the plan of off an assassination that happened on my own world. Granted, they didn’t use a massive bronze spike either, they used a tiny little pellet. I can’t quite match that, I don’t think I can make the pellet small enough while also carrying enough poison, but I should be able to manage with something about this size,” he said, holding up a very fine needle, about an inch long, “The victim in the assassination I’m basing my plan on originally thought that he’d been bitten by a bug, and it wasn’t until after that he realized he’d been poisoned. They even disguised the weapon like I’m doing here, though they hid the airgun in an umbrella instead of a cane.”

“Umbrella?” Enes asked.

“Ah, it’s like a parasol, but meant to keep off rain instead of the sun.”

“Air gun?”

“Right,” he said, snapping his fingers and then hurriedly picking through the things on the workbench, “Here we are, I mentioned storing air in a reservoir, that’s what these are.”

He held out a short bronze cylinder and a long leather pouch to Enes, “Air is stored under pressure in, well, one of these. I’ll need to figure out which. It’s released by opening a valve, something I also need to figure out, and then it’s forced through the barrel. That launches the needle, hopefully.”

“How is this held together?” Enes asked, taking the little bronze tube and turning it over in her hands.

“It’s soldered together. Soldering isn’t nearly as strong as welding, but it’s a lot easier. Imagine trying to weld together an egg. I’m just not that good a blacksmith to do work that precise.”

“Is this just hammered bronze?”

“Yeah, the thinnest and most flexible I could find, bent into a tube. The soldering is done with molten lead, that’s also how the end caps are held on. It’s not great, but it can hold pressure longer than the little leather pouch can,” he said.

Enes set the bronze bit of metal down on the workbench and took up the bit of leather, “This just looks like a very small wineskin.”

“That’s basically all it is, it can hold more pressure than the metal canister can but it leaks constantly and I can’t figure out how to seal it any better than I already have.”

I wasn’t about to get a word in anytime soon, so I departed gracefully, leaving Quinn in Enes’s capable hands for the time being.

-----

Quinn was definitely an odd one, and that was even more clear when he thought that he was alone. It was something I’d noticed early on, it was maybe the second or third day after he said he’d help me kill Nusalvo and rescue Concia. Aris had gone to get him lunch and Enes had gone to relieve herself which left him alone in the library for maybe the first time since he’d arrived. I’d hoped to catch him unawares, in the middle of plotting some sort of escape or rebellion. Reworking all of my ledgers, throwing himself into the task of killing my enemies and freeing my sister, it seemed all too easy. I was inclined to let him do it, if only because I would take any opportunity to help my sister, but I was no fool. I’d thought that he was putting on a face as he worked for me, so eager to solve my problems. As it turned out, I was right, though not in the way I’d imagined.

He normally seemed to be almost innocently committed to whatever he was doing, and genuinely happy to do the work and to explain it to those that would listen. He was calm, and the only time I’d ever seen him be any different was when he was arguing with Cusole about the best way to write the ledgers. Well, there was also the first night when I’d mistakenly handed him the knife. I expected to see that darker side of him again once he thought that no one was watching, but instead he seemed almost vulnerable. He didn’t leap up to dig through a secret cache of supplies, instead he stayed right where he was and seemed to draw inwards. His normally straight back was hunched over, and his broad shoulders were pulled in. It made him look smaller than he really was, and it drew attention to how slim his arms and legs were. Instead of the usual small smile, his expression was almost flat. Most of it had indeed been an act, though not in the way that I’d thought.

I’d been sure to pay more attention over the next two weeks as he was gathering material for, and set to work on, what I now knew was the blowgun. Whenever Aris and Enes would both be out of the room, I’d be sure to watch covertly. I still wanted to be sure that he wasn’t planning escape, but now I also wanted to know just what made him tic. Trying to hide any rebellious intent was one thing, but that’s not what he seemed to be doing. Instead he was hiding what exactly? That he wasn’t happy? Most people could be forgiven for not being totally pleased to be made a slave, even if it was a life of luxury, it took time to adjust. The only time he didn’t seem to be acting was when he was showing off something he’d made, or something he’d done, like reworking the ledgers. The rest of the time though, he was wearing his happy face.

*Oh I think I know just what will cheer him up*

It was the evening after showing Enes the blowgun, Quinn sequestered himself in the library like he always did in the evening. It seemed to be his sanctuary, more so even than his bedroom, and he’d often stay up late reading whatever books he pulled off of the shelf. I decided to take advantage of my well timed observation, and saw to it that Aris and Enes would be elsewhere while I cheered Quinn up.

I was barefoot as I stalked through the library, and had chosen a blue silk nightie for the occasion. It was nothing too immodest, though it was rather short, and I wasn’t wearing anything underneath. To complete the look I’d taken out my hair pins, letting my long hair fall in tousled curls down past my shoulders. The sun had just gone down below the horizon as I crept up behind Quinn, and I found him sitting in an armchair reading by candle light.

*Perfect.*

I was very quiet as I crept up behind him, Quinn seemed to make up for poor vision with surprisingly good hearing, and I didn’t want him to have a chance to put his face back on before I caught him. His book was held in his lap, and he was hunched over reading. I decided on tender instead of vampy, it seemed like Quinn might be a little more receptive to that sort of treatment. I slipped up beside him, on the side away from the light.

“Quinn,” I said quietly, as I placed a gentle hand on the back of his head, running my fingers through his thick brown hair, “Are you alright?”

He seemed a little startled to see me there, but didn’t put his face back on, “Uh yeah, I guess.”

He leaned backwards, stretching tiredly, and I took advantage of the opening. I slipped over the arm of the chair and sat across his lap. I put one arm around his neck, the other hand stroking his hair.

“Are you sure Quinn?” I said softly, “I worry about you, and you always seem a little… Not sad, but tense, when you think no one else is watching. What’s wrong Quinn? I know it’s hard to adjust sometimes, is there anything I can do for you to make you feel better?”

He was looking down, not meeting my eyes as I spoke, this was the side of him that he’d been hiding away.

“It’s not really the change that gets to me,” he said, still not meeting my eyes, “Hell, if I hadn’t met you I’d have just ended up doing the same sort of stuff for someone else. It’s just that I’m not used to being around people so much.”

“What do you mean?” I asked, shifting around in his lap in a way that was meant to be enticing.

He let out a breath, relaxing a little, “I’m just used to being alone most times. I find it a little, draining, to have to interact with people all the time. And between Aris and Enes I’ve not had more than a few minutes alone since I landed on the beach. I get it, I understand why they’re following me around, but it feels suffocating. I hope I haven’t been insulting to them at all, I’ve been trying to make an effort not to be rude, but sometimes I just want them to leave me alone.”

“No, I don’t think you’ve been rude to them Quinn. Are all humans so solitary?”

“No, compared to other humans I’m definitely not normal,” he said, rather bitterly.

I lifted his chin with one gentle hand, to meet his eyes, “Do you want me to leave you alone?”

He was quiet for a moment, then looked away shyly, “No.”

I leaned in, lips just brushing the nape of his neck, “Well then, how about this. If you promise to be very good and do as I say, I’ll let Aris and Enes have a break, and I’ll keep an eye on you myself. Just you and me, with no one else around to bother you. Would you like that?”

*And he’s almost…*

“Yeah,” he said, in a hoarse whisper.

“Promise,” I instructed.

“I promise,” he said.

“You promise to do what?” I prompted.

“I promise to be good… and to do as you say,” he said, in the same hoarse whisper.

*…mine*

“Good, now pick me up,” I instructed, “And carry me to my bedroom.”

He did as he was told, and I wrapped my arms tightly around his neck as I was lifted into the air. It was exhilarating, and a little frightening. I felt like a child in his arms, but I knew that I was the one in control now. He carried me to the doorway, and peeked out a little awkwardly.

“You wouldn’t be embarrassed if someone saw us would you?” I asked, knowing the answer.

“I’m… a very private person,” he said, a little unsteadily.

“Well as long as you’re good Quinn, I’ll make sure that you don’t get embarrassed. You will be good won’t you Quinn?”

“Yes,” he said, stepping into the hall, and walking towards my bedroom.

“Yes what?” I prompted.

“Yes Lady Chypia.”

“Very good Quinn, but since you’re going to be behaving yourself you can call me m’Lady,” I said graciously.

“Yes m’Lady.”

Quinn carried me into my bedroom, and as planned Pasa was elsewhere. Moonlight and a cool breeze streamed in through massive windows, and Pasa had left several candles burning before she’d left.

“Set me down on the bed,” I instructed.

He did as he was told, but when he went to let me go I took hold of his tunic in both hands, and dragged him down onto the bed next to me. He was surprisingly light for someone so large, and I pressed his back down onto the bed. I pulled myself up onto him, straddling his upper chest. I pulled my nightie up over my head, and took hold of Quinn’s hair in both hands. I considered, for a heated moment, hauling myself just a bit forwards.

*Tender. Remember, tender. For now.*

I relaxed my grip on his hair, and stroked it instead. He did seem awfully young, *how young I wonder?* “Have you ever been with a woman before Quinn?”

He turned absolutely bright red, and I had to work to keep my smile sweet instead of predatory, “Uh, no, not really.”

*Oh my dear Quinn. I am going to twist you up in knots, I’ll have you eating out of my hand by the time I’m done with you. This is so much better than whips and chains.*

I leaned down to kiss him lightly on the lips, my hair falling around him. He brought a hand up to the back of my neck, gently pulling me deeper into the kiss. I let him, and an involuntary shiver ran through me. Nearly three weeks, it almost never took this long for the first time, but then I hadn’t really understood him very well. Most men you wave a willing and beautiful woman in front of will jump on her at the first opportunity. It was rare that I had to take matters in my own hands, usually I let Aris or Pasa be the one to do it, but oh Verrin. I am going to enjoy this.

I pulled back from the kiss, and took in the wonderful expression on Quinn’s face. His lips were a little puffy from kissing, eyes were unfocused, and face flushed. I pulled at his clothes, finding the knot that held the tunic shut and tearing at it desperately. I got it loose and flung the short silk rope away from the bed. My mouth hung open and I was salivating as I finally pulled the tunic open. I lifted myself up, luxuriating in just how much there was to play with, he seemed to stretch out endlessly. I was tiny compared to Quinn, but having so much man under my control felt fantastic. I lowered myself down, impaling myself on Quinn, and I shuddered as he entered me. It was almost more than I could take.

*Oh, to hell with tender.*

Quinn’s hands found my hips, and the almost circled my narrow waist. I put my hands on his chest, lifting myself up and down, up and down, over and over and over and over. I should have paced myself, I didn’t want it to end too soon, but I’d been waiting for this moment for weeks. I didn’t slow, I didn’t stop, instead I quickened my pace, taking in all of him as quickly as I could.

“Mmmaanghhh- Ohh Verrin, Ohh Q-Quinn,” I gasped out, “Hhh-Ohhhh”

I held on as best I could. My toes curled almost painfully, and my back arched as I dragged my fingernails across Quinn’s chest. I fell forwards limply, unable to hold myself up anymore. It seemed that Quinn wasn’t quite done with me though, and he wasn’t about to let it end. His grip tightened on my waist, and it was his turn to lift me up and down, up and down, over and over and over and- *Oh Verrin!* It was almost overwhelming, and I clawed weakly at his chest and shoulders as he did as he pleased with my body.

I **wanted** him so much, and I found myself biting at his chest. My teeth found his collar bone and I latched on. I was sure that I was being too rough, and that in a second my mouth would be full of the taste of blood, but I did **not** care.

By the time he was finally done with me I was as limp as a ragdoll, and my whole body was quivering. I could barely think, let alone see, and yet I still could have done with more. I tried to form the words that would order him to continue, beg him to continue, but it just came out as a lewd moan. I couldn’t see through the splotches of colour that filled my vision, but I felt Quinn draw me in. I pulled myself towards the scent of his body. He was hot to the touch, and I curled up close to him, the heat of him banishing the cold of the cool night air.

-----

I woke several hours later, as the sun rose to light the large bedroom. I found myself curled up against Quinn, laying atop the covers. I sat up slowly, stretching contentedly. Every muscle felt… loose, and there was a sort of pleasant tiredness. I cast my gaze over Quinn’s still sleeping form. Some part of me, the tiny part that wasn’t being overwhelmed by the experience, had worried that I might have lost some measure of control as I mewled and begged for more all through last night. I need not have worried though, and the proof was all over Quinn’s body. I’d left claw marks all up and down his shoulders, chest, and sides. There were a collection of bite marks all along both collar bones.

*Mmm, oh yes. Now there’s some proof of ownership, who needs a brand?*

I did feel slightly sorry for him though. I had not been gentle with him, and while I didn’t taste blood in my mouth, the bite marks would take some time to heal. I could already see dark bruises forming where I’d bitten him. For a moment I considered getting the jar of healing salve from my bureau, but eventually decided against it. He was going to feel every twinge of pain, the tenderness where he’d bruised, the stinging as his clothes rubbed against the scratches, and remember just who owned him.

There was one mark though, that was out of place. A long scar, running from just under one pectoral, and down to the corner of his hip. It had been closed properly, though crudely, I could see the crisscrossing marks that had been left by the stitches. The scar was a livid, puckered, red line. I’d need to have that healed properly. I couldn’t have him bearing marks left by another, and it was the one ugly mark on an otherwise beautiful specimen. I traced one finger along the scar, it looked to have been left by some sort of blade, there was surely a story there. Quinn twinged slightly as I traced the scar down to his hip, it seemed that he was a little ticklish. He stirred awake, and rubbed at his eyes.

“You are very demanding of your servants m’Lady,” he said, by way of greeting.

“That’s a rather polite way to put it I think Quinn,” I said vampishly.

He looked down at his chest, and shifted slightly in the bed, “Well if this is what I get for doing as commanded then I don’t ever want to find out what happens if I deny you satisfaction,” he said, wearing a satisfied smile.

I lay back down, resting my head on his shoulder, though I was careful not to aggravate his bruises, “Are all humans quite so… everything?” I said, gesturing towards the implement of my pleasure.

He bit his lower lip, turning a little pink, “I’d like to say that I’m some paragon of human masculinity, but really I’m pretty average unfortunately. I’m definitely really tall for a human, but beyond that I’m not too special as humans go.”

“Mmm, well. I think I’m definitely a fan of your size.”

I let out a long sigh, looking towards the clock on the far wall.

“Something wrong, m’Lady?” he asked.

“Oh, I’ve just got a meeting with some cloth merchants this afternoon. I’m going to need to bathe and get dressed eventually,” I looked at Quinn, this would be a perfect chance to show him off for the first time, “I think I’d like you to check their figures for me, you can do that for me can’t you Quinn?”

“Oh?” He asked, “Well if it’s anything like checking your figure was then I’m sure I’ll have no trouble. M’Lady.”

*Give them one good tumble, and all of a sudden...* Well, it wasn’t like I didn’t enjoy the way that he was enjoying me.

“I’m thinking of sponsoring their little guild, and I want to be sure that I’m not going to be cheated. Just think, you’ll have another chance to show off your new numbering system.”

Quinn smiled at that, which was good, I wasn’t sure how he’d feel about meeting yet more people, “Yes m’Lady,” he said.

“Good, now pick me up,” I instructed.

He raised an eyebrow, but did as he was told.

“Now, carry me to my bathroom. Aris and Pasa aren’t here, so you’ll just have to do.”

It took nearly an hour longer than usual for me to finally stumble out of the bathroom on weak knees, but oh dear Verrin, Quinn was much more fun in the bath than Aris or Pasa ever were.

# Chapter 21

Quinn

-----

The more I thought about it, the more I realized how terrible an idea it was to let Lady Chypia ‘seduce’ me. I’d thought that it would be a good way to get her to trust me, after all, if she thought that I was well in hand then she’d not be keeping as close an eye on me. And to some extent, that was true. The difference was clear, and immediate, I had more or less free reign in the grounds of the manor. No longer was Aris following me around all the time, and when I was working in the little workshop I’d set up I didn’t have Enes watching constantly.

I wanted her to underestimate me, so I did my best to act vulnerable and awkward If I could make her think that I felt uncomfortable around anyone other than herself then she’d conclude that I was basically hers already. After all, what’s better than a slave that runs **towards** you, and only you, when seeking comfort and safety. The trouble was, it hadn’t taken a whole hell of a lot of acting on my part, and that scared the hell out of me. In trying to get her to underestimate me I’d in fact been underestimating her, or at least overestimating myself. I really was vulnerable and awkward, and I really did feel uncomfortable around most people. I’d wanted to trick Lady Chypia into thinking that she was one of the few people I felt okay around, and I was fairly sure that I’d convinced her, but was it really a trick, if that was how I really felt?

*I should have paid more attention to what Thera said. I really am naïve when it comes to this sort of thing. Is that all it takes? For a pretty woman to show a modicum of interest, and provide the tiniest amount of emotional support?*

After Thera and Lady Chypia, and the clear interest shown by both Sila and Aris I’d been starting to think of myself differently. Less awkward loner, and more medieval Captain Kirk. The more I thought about it, the more I realized that this was not the case. Thera had been right, it was fairly easy for others to take advantage of my naiveté. Sila had been looking for literally any alternative to what would have been several decades of domestic abuse. Aris had thought of sleeping with me as just part of the job. Lady Chypia wanted some way to exercise control, and to make me more loyal. Thera had wanted to scratch an itch, and for all I knew she’d jumped on the first mildly attractive non-city elf to walk through the door.

I was probably being too harsh, especially to Thera, but I was a little caught up wallowing in my own self doubt.

*And what the hell is my escape plan again?*

I’d seized upon the idea of killing Nusalvo to ingratiate myself to Lady Chypia, but that was another idea that was revealed to be terrible as I thought about it more. What, was it going to cause chaos? Well maybe, but he was the heir, not the Marquis. The rest of the city would keep ticking along as usual. It would give me a chance to help out Lady Chypia’s sister, but why was I doing that again? Slavery, especially the sort that Concia seemed to be a victim of, was pretty damn high on my list of ‘fates comparable to death’, but she was by no means the only Mage that needed help. She probably wasn’t even the easiest to rescue. I’d guess that Lady Chypia would want to take the opportunity to get her sister out of the city, and I was right, but that didn’t help me much. I’d imagined me tagging along when Concia was whisked out, but that idea didn’t hold up though.

Lady Chypia would arrange for Concia to escape Nusalvo’s manor while it was still being worked out what to do with her, this was the first hurdle. The second hurdle being the city gates, and Lady Chypia would likely be able to arrange for some guard to be looking the other way while Concia slipped out. Then Concia would run like hell to Nimre, or even just Ashur, and she’d be safe. There were two problems with trying to crash the little freedom party though. The first was that at no point in the escape plan would I be very helpful. Arranging the escape? Maybe, but I was Lady Chypia’s steward, and it would be odd for me to be missing during the transition. I’d probably have my hands full helping to sort the inheritance out. Better to pick someone that wouldn’t be missed, maybe Enes or Amas, especially since they’d be able to handle any opposition that they might face. Unarmed against an unskilled opponent I’d be fine, but that was a low damn bar, and if there was opposition it wasn’t going to be unskilled and it sure as hell wouldn’t be unarmed. No, I couldn’t insert myself there. Could I help get Concia past the city gates? No, that was even more laughable. I’d had some grand designs involving an improvised gunpowder firework, but it was foolishness. Lady Chypia had the contacts, and knew the right sort of people. Some bribe or favour, and the way would be clear, and it wouldn’t draw nearly as much attention as my idea. She might not even need to bribe anyone if she happened to know of some gap in the guard rotation, or of some hidden passage out of the city. It was when I considered Concia’s overland escape to Ashur or Nimre that I realized the bigger problem.

If what I’d heard about the way that Mages were treated was true then there was no way in hell that Concia would be in a state to get herself out of the city, and to the border. Just for me, it would be five or six days, and that was at double the normal elf traveling pace. She probably wouldn’t be able to manage even that, and she’d probably need to dodge whatever search parties were sent out to catch her once it was realized that she’d escaped. No, Lady Chypia would send her with someone, probably several someones, and none of them would be me. Why would she even consider it? From her perspective not only was I very valuable, I was also probably one of the least prepared people for this sort of operation. Over long distances I was pretty sure I could keep ahead of whatever tracking parties were sent after myself, but that didn’t help Concia any. Bluffing her into thinking I was some great warrior wasn’t going to work either, and she already knew that the only weapon I was familiar with had been a hobby. If she’d wanted an archer along then anyone who did it professionally would be a much better pick.

No. I’d be staying here when Concia escaped.

*Lady Chypia really has been turning me to her side, the only one I’ve been pretending to is myself. I need to get the hell out of here, no more screwing around with air guns and half assed plans.*

It was sixty two days until the deadline, and it would take eighteen days to get to Nimre on foot. That left forty four days to come up with a **real** plan that wasn’t some James Bond level bullshit. Less even than that, leaving forty four days from now would put me in Nimre on the day of the deadline around lunch time. That left no room for error, and for all I knew they closed up early on the last day. I wouldn’t be leaving forty four days from now, I’d be leaving as soon as I had a decent chance of escape.

One, I needed six days of food to get me out of Adympia. I wasn’t going to be able to stop at inns along the way to sleep and eat.

Sleeping, that was two. I needed some form of shelter that was quick to set up and tear down for those same six days.

Three, I needed money. I’d been working on that already, Lady Chypia had given me quite a large budget for my airgun and I might have been embezzling it a little.

Four, I needed to get these damnable cuffs off. I’d already tried the trick with the metal file, and it had not gone well. I’d snuck it into the bathroom inside my tunic and had timed my progress on my watch, I wanted some idea of how long it would take to get these off when it came time. For sixty seconds I’d scraped away with the file, working just on the edge near my wrist, I didn’t want anyone to notice any suspicious marks left on the cuff. I need not have worried, in the sixty seconds I’d timed it for I’d barely scuffed the cuff. It wasn’t zero progress, but this was not the solution I was looking for. The cuffs looked and felt like gold, they were even the right weight, but they were far too tough. It was probably the enchantment I’d first detected weeks ago. The enchantment probably also accounted for how comfortable the cuffs were. By all rights they should have rubbed my wrists raw, I’d been wearing them every hour of the day for weeks, and padding was only going to help so much.

Five, I needed to get the hell out of the city. Walking out the front gates was not going to be an option, cuffs or not, illusion or not. The guards would check to see if any of those leaving had cuffs on, and in theory if you were un-cuffed you’d be free to leave. Unfortunately, I was somewhat conspicuous, and I’d be recognized. I’d spent the past two and a half weeks stumbling around the city, looking for material, and people knew that I belonged to Lady Chypia. An illusion was similarly useless, at least if I wanted to leave through one of the gates. I’d feared some sort of city wide magic detection grid when I’d first used Detect Magic on the cuffs, and while there wasn’t such a grid over the whole city, there was some sort of detection system in place at each of the gates.

“Quinn?”

I had a solid plan for three, maybe one and two as well, but four and five were going to take some work.

“Quinn?” Lady Chypia said, pulling me out of my thoughts, “Are you alright? You’re sweating.”

We’d been walking through what felt like the equivalent to an ancient industrial park, though industrial was probably the wrong word. From what I could tell most ‘factories’ were just warehouses full of slaves working by hand. The closest thing that the Adympians had to machinery was the few mills in the city, and they weren’t terribly impressive. Just a big water wheel, some very basic gearing, and a big damn rock. Lady Chypia had taken me with her when she went to inspect the facilities in use by her potential business partners. I’d gotten lost in thought on our way back to the carriage, and it seemed that Lady Chypia had noticed.

“Sorry,” I said, stepping closer to her, “Just a little distracted, it’s a little crowded here.”

Even though most slaves would still be working in the factories at this hour, the streets were very busy. Enes and Amas were doing their job and keeping the rabble some distance back, but the street was as crowded as any in Toronto.

“Don’t worry,” she said, taking my arm, “The carriage is just ahead, and the merchants are only sending two of their number. I trust that you’re still going to be looking over their ledgers for me?”

“Of course,” I said, and I berated myself mentally for how eagerly I’d responded.

I paid a little more attention to my surroundings, keeping my head up. Like the other elves cities I’d visited this place seemed to be very clean compared to what I’d heard of cities even as modern as Victorian London. I don’t think I could have put up with a city where people threw their garbage and sewage out into the street, and where cholera and other diseases ran rampant. Even here among the factories everything was rather well kept. There were no trees or other greenery lining the streets, but it was kept clean at least.

“What does that marking mean?” I asked, gesturing towards one of the mills. This one, like most of the other’s I’d seen, had the doors chained shut and a sign nailed to the wall. On the sign was a roughly painted little anvil, though some of the other signs had scissors or bottles instead of the little anvil.

“Hmmm? Oh, that’s the mark of the blacksmith’s guild. The mill owner likely found their debts to be too much for them and had to close up shop. Usually when that happens their slaves and assets are sold off to try to pay back some of their creditors. It looks like they couldn’t find a buyer for the mill, so they just handed the whole building over to the blacksmith’s guild. They don’t seem to want the mill either, that sign lets potential buyers know where to look if they’d like to make an offer,” Lady Chypia explained.

*Abandoned mill? Now there’s an idea…*

“Why are so many of them locked up? I thought that food would be the sort of thing that’s always in demand.”

“Oh it is, but business is moving elsewhere. The city used to import most of its grain from Ashur, and it would come in by sea, then be milled into flour here in the city. The political situation has been a little complicated of late though, and while there’s no embargo, there are many fewer ships bringing in grain. Instead most of the grain comes in by land now, from the nearby farming villages, and much of it is already milled into flour before it gets here.”

“So a lot of the mills are having a hard time staying in business, and when they go out of business no one wants to bother buying the buildings. Couldn’t they just be converted into factory space?”

“Maybe, but the creditors want their money’s worth out of the buildings. It costs them little to wait things out, and the situation with Ashur will be resolved eventually. Why, did you have some use in mind for them? Some innovation from your world?”

I let out a breath, “I don’t really know. There’s plenty that humans have used water power for over our history, I’m just not that familiar with the specifics. You use it to turn the millstones, we use it to generate electricity. I could probably work out how to do either, it’s everything in between that I don’t know about. I know that those looms the girls were working could be powered from the water wheel somehow, but it’s been a couple hundred years since that sort of technology was in use, I’d need to spend some time thinking about it.”

Enes pulled open the door to the carriage and I let Lady Chypia enter first. I was about to take a seat across from her, when she patted the bench beside her. I sat down, and she took my arm again.

“A couple hundred years? That’s not very long Quinn, you might be young, but you must remember something.” she said.

“A couple hundred years might not be that long for an elf, but for a human that’s three or four lifetimes.”

“What?” Lady Chypia exclaimed, seeming genuinely surprised.

*Whoops, is this going to be a problem?*

“Humans don’t live nearly as long as elves do. I’m only twenty two, if you take really good care of me I might live for another sixty or so years. Without proper medicine, or I guess magic, I’d probably only get another forty, maybe fifty years if I was careful. Even then, I’m probably at my physical peak right now. I’m in damn good shape, but I can only keep that up for so long. In ten years I’ll probably be more or less where I am now, but I’ll look noticeably older. Ten years after that and I might not be able to keep up quite the same pace, and I’ll definitely look older then. That’s not to say that I’d fall apart, but it would certainly be more challenging to stay in shape than it is now.”

It seemed to take a moment for Lady Chypia to process all of this, and I felt her grip tighten on my arm.

“That’s not fair,” She said, seeming angry, “I deserve more than a few decades from you.”

“Sorry m’Lady. But there’s not really anything to be done about that,” I said, with a bittersweet smile. I was after all, incredibly jealous of just how long lived the elves were.

“Yes there is,” she said sharply, and her grip became painfully tight on my arm, “I’ll need to find a Mage that can cast the proper spell, but I’m not about to let you waste away before my eyes.”

*What?*

“What?” I asked, a little bewildered.

Lady Chypia let go of my arm, and cupped my face in her hands, “You’re mine Quinn, and I plan to have you around for a very long time.”

-----

-----

Cusole, Erilon, and I had the clothier’s ledgers spread out on one of the tables in the library. I could hear Lady Chypia’s conversation with the two men through the open door to the sitting room, and from the feel of things I guessed that this business deal was more like an acquisition. This explained Lady Chypia’s interest in their books, they’d be her books soon if all went well. Cusole and Erilon had not been difficult to bring around to my way of thinking once I had Lady Chypia’s seal of approval, and between the three of us we got through the ledgers rather quickly. We went over each one twice before the meeting was finished, and I was briefly disappointed that I didn’t find anything nefarious on the part of the merchants. Then I kicked myself. Dammit I was **not** looking for ways to impress Lady Chypia.

The meeting went well, and while nothing was decided for certain, Lady Chypia acquiring their little business seemed to be a forgone conclusion. I spent what was left of the day trying to figure out real solutions to my actual problems. It wasn’t like food would be hard to get my hands on, and I could work something out for sleeping accommodations, but whatever I made or gathered I needed to be able to pass off as something else or hide. That was true for all of my problems, I had the means and materials to build a big damn rope ladder for climbing the city wall, but if anyone else saw what I’d made then they might get just a little suspicions.

I was going to finish the air gun before I left, really all I had left to do was prepare the poison and figure out how to build the valve. I’d leave that night, assuming I had solved problems four and five. It should be enough to help Concia, Lady Chypia could find someone to use the gun, and from there she’d be able to get her sister out of the city on her own.

-----

I took dinner with Lady Chypia that evening, and I thought that I’d get away with reading for a while before bed, but no such luck. Lady Chypia seemed eager to turn in early, and as of now I was apparently sleeping in her room. I felt more than a little conflicted with this idea. On the one hand, high school Quinn would have killed for thirty seconds with Lady Chypia, but on the other hand the whole situation made me feel a little sick. I was definitely not in control here, and the same situation that had made me feel uncomfortable when Aris and Pasa threw themselves at me, now applied to me.

Well if I had to do this, then I was going to do it my way. She’d pushed me back down onto the bed, clearly expecting me to wait for her attention, and then she went to get something out of a desk drawer. She was bent over, facing away from me, and the little pink nightie rode up a little which gave me a rather nice view. I hopped up out of bed as quietly as I could, and stalked up behind her. I wrapped both my arms around her waist, and hauled her off her feet. She let out a surprised cry, loud enough that I was briefly struck with the image of Amas and Enes bursting into the room, and I threw her over my shoulder. I carried her into the bathroom, and opened one of the taps on the huge tub. I sat her down roughly, but not too roughly, on the counter. Her face was flushed and her hair was mussed. Her mouth was just slightly open, and she was looking at me through half-lidded eyes. I pushed her back with one hand, and her back thumped against the wall. She tilted her head back, and bit at her lower lip, clearly excited. She lunged forwards, trying to wrap her arms around my neck, drawing me into a kiss. I caught her by the neck with one hand, and pushed her back against the wall. She grabbed my arm with both hands, trying to loosen my grip. I leaned in, kissing her deeply, as I used my other hand to tug the nightie up and off of her. I had to let go of her neck to get the nightie over her head, and she took that chance to try to get loose. I caught her again though, pushing her roughly back into the wall, and she growled and thrashed as I tugged at the knot that held my tunic closed.

The tunic dropped to the floor and I let go of her neck, instead picking her up by her waist. She pulled herself in towards me, trying to wrap her arms and legs around my torso. I carried her away from the counter and towards the bath. I shook loose of her arms and dropped her into the now full tub with a splash. She shrieked, loudly enough that I was sure the guards would come rushing in, and I turned off the cold water tap. She was gasping, huge eyes even wider, scrambling at the sides of the bath to get out of the frigid water. I pushed her back down until just her head was above the water, and I climbed in on top of her.

I did have some trouble finding just where to put myself, but in my defence the water was **very** cold. Once I did, Lady Chypia stopped trying to scramble up the side of the tub, and instead wrapped herself around me. I didn't stop until well after she made her satisfaction known, and she hadn’t been quiet about it either. It wasn’t until I started to really start to feel the effects of the cold that I finally picked her up out of the bath. She was shivering uncontrollably, and I sat her back down on the counter. Unlike last time it was all she could do to wrap her arms around herself. I took my time as I dried off first, leaving her there wet and shivering on the counter. I grabbed a fresh towel, and bundled her up in it, getting her mostly dry. I picked her up in the little bundle, and carried her back into the bedroom.

I dumped her unceremoniously on the foot of the bed, before slipping in under the covers. It took her a moment, but she kicked herself free of the towel, and then crawled up to the head of the bed. She scrambled in under the covers and pressed herself to my chest, still shivering like mad. I shifted around, getting comfortable, and put an arm around her.

*I really hope she doesn’t execute me in the morning.*

-----

I woke the next morning to find Lady Chypia sitting on my chest, and she a firm grip on my hair with both hands.

“Quinn?” She asked, in a normal every day tone.

“Yes Lady Chypia?” I asked, in the same tone.

“I swear, by Verrin, if you ever do that again,” she started, her voice suddenly harsh and angry.

*Whoops*

“You had better wait at least a week,” she finished.

I laughed, “I’m just glad Enes didn’t come in, ready to cut my head off. She must have heard the sound you made when I dropped you into the tub.”

She sighed, and slipped back down under the covers. I rolled onto my side and pulled her back against my chest.

“The whole manor probably would have heard me, but my rooms are soundproofed magically. It was quite expensive, but worth it,” she said, a little duskily, as she settled against me, “I’ve got an image to maintain, I can’t have the whole manor hearing me moan like a whore when I’m being entertained by a gentleman caller.”

*I’ll file that information away for later. The sound proofing, not the moaning like a whore part. That one was obvious on the first night.*

“If you have any other… inventive, ideas, do let me know. Unless… me knowing makes it less fun,” she said in her dusky voice, as she rubbed her tailbone against my hips.

*I bet I can cross off problem two right here.*

“I do have one in mind, I’ll need to gather some materials though,” I teased.

“Oh? What kind of materials?” She asked, clearly interested.

“Hmm, seven or eight feet of silk cloth, some rope, and two wooden rods each three or four feet long. And I’ll need somewhere sturdy to hang it from.”

“Should I be worried?” A little confusion sneaking into her voice.

“No, I think you’ll enjoy it. Though there will be a lot less screaming on your part.”

# Chapter 22

Quinn

-----

Lady Chypia seemed eager to test the limits of my endurance, and didn’t let me out of bed until nearly lunchtime. I managed to talk my way free of her grip only by reiterating my promise for a surprise the following evening. Once I did get loose I found that I’d been granted a little more freedom. No longer would I be required to take Enes or Aris with me when I left the manor. This was less freedom than it sounded like though. Sure, this definitely gave me the chance to do a little recon without Chypia knowing just what I was looking into, but on the other hand I still wasn’t going to be able to leave the city. I might have an easier time buying tools or materials for my escape, but on the other hand, I didn’t really have a place to hide them now that I was playing bed warmer for Lady Chypia. I took what advantage I could though, and spent some time walking around the city, looking for some alternative to rushing one of the gates. It didn’t help that aside from Lady Chypia and her servants, I knew no one in the city. I didn’t even know where to start if I wanted to try to get in contact with either the criminal underworld of the city, or some sort of rebellious faction. The cuffs didn’t help, they marked me as property to anyone that saw me, and the tunic was short sleeved. I wasn’t going to be able to hide them without the deception being conspicuous.

*Side objective one: Get my coat back*

It was definitely odd, compared to Adympian clothing, but the oddity was not in the way that it could hide the cuffs. Hopefully it could distract from the rest of my planned deception.

Lady Chypia had returned my knife and multitool when I started to assemble my little workshop, which left only my jacket to recover. It was long enough to cover the cuffs, so if I couldn’t get them off before escaping I could at least just wear the jacket. It wasn’t ideal, but I’d rather get the hell gone than waste time trying to figure out how to cut through them.

*I need to ask Lady Chypia about Enutur and his big stupid boat. If some of my things are kicking around the city it might be nice to take them with me when I leave.*

I did a full circuit of the city, staying a street or so back from the city wall. I didn’t want to make it look like I was casing the joint after all. I was disappointed by what I found, or rather, by what I didn’t find. No big crumbling sections, no conveniently climbable trees overhanging one side of the wall, and nowhere did it seem low enough to risk jumping from the top. In fact, if there was a tree tall enough to overhang the wall then it would be fifty or sixty feet tall. It looked like the city walls were as much designed to keep people in, as they were designed to keep them out. I finished my circuit, ending up on the far side of the harbour from where I started.

*Well, this might work…*

I looked down the length of the sea wall that jutted out into the harbour. I could see the tiny figures of the city guard patrolling the wall near the opening to the sea, and it seemed rather light, at least compared to the heavy presence at the city gates. The trouble would be finding a boat to steal. I might be able to swim the distance, but it seemed like a really good way to get myself killed. The tide was coming in as I watched and while most of the harbour was fairly calm, it was a harbour after all, the area just along the sea wall was very rough. Waves crashed against the base of the wall, and if I got too close I’d be slammed against the massive stone blocks. I didn’t really want to swim down the middle of the harbour either, since such a large volume of water flowing through the small gap in the sea wall was sure to create all sorts of dangerous currents. Swimming would also mean getting everything I carried with me wet, probably ruining any food I brought along, unless I could figure out some sort of waterproof container.

*Because the last two times I took a swim went so well.*

I walked the length of the waterfront, looking for boats that seemed ripe for the picking, and mentally reviewing my various options for air gun valves. On the one hand, I did come up with a design that should work well, on the other hand, I found that stealing a boat was not really going to be an option. The Adympians weren’t stupid, they recognized the harbour for the massive escape route that it was, and took steps to counter this weakness. I’d have to check, but it was very likely that there was some sort of city ordinance in place covering the proper storage of watercraft. I wasn’t about to find a boat sitting on a sand bank, turned belly up, and held in place only by a short chain and a cheap lock.

Swimming would be risky as hell, but stealing a boat might be worse. I didn’t want my escape plans held up by my fumbling around, looking for a building to break into, if shit hit the fan and I needed to leave on zero warning. Swimming carried a big risk, but it was a risk I could plan for accurately. Breaking in and stealing a boat would be hard to plan for, and I’d probably be dodging whatever night time guard patrols existed while I did it.

*Hell, I might steal the boat, only to be caught as I dragged it across the street and into the sea.*

It brought me closer to solving problem number five at least.

-----

I got waterproofing sorted out surprisingly quickly, once I realized that the solution to sleeping on the road should also keep my things dry while in the water. Assuming of course, that I did end up swimming. The hammock itself would be a double or triple layer silk sheet, but I needed a tarp to string over it to keep the rain off. Contemporary tents were apparently made of either oilskin, or waxed leather, so this worked out quite well. I paid for a sheet of oilskin, large enough to provide cover for the hammock as I slept in it. Additionally, I could use that same tarp to wrap up all of my gear before taking the plunge.

This still left me swimming to freedom though, which was not an ideal solution. Would it be unexpected? Certainly. But that was probably because it was a stupid idea. I’d have some advantage since neither wood nor city elves seemed to have anything like human endurance, but that just meant that the swim would be incredibly dangerous instead of suicidal.

-----

Once I got back to the manor it only took a short time to get the hammock finished. Using a solid sheet was far quicker than hand-knotting what was basically a giant net, and I was done a little before dinner. I quickly sketched out my valve design so I wouldn’t forget it, then dropped off the hammock in our room before washing up for dinner with Lady Chypia.

“I’m surprised that you were so bold as to try your little trick with the bath, last night,” she was saying, as we were finishing our dinner.

“Well maybe I was feeling a little rebellious. That’s the sort of thing you keep me around for, isn’t it?” I said, trying to not to seem too sure of myself.

“Mmm,” she smiled, pursing her lips, “That was awfully cruel of you. Maybe I need to have you make it up to me.”

“Oh, and just how would I do that?” I asked, leaning back in my chair.

“Maybe I’ll have you kneel at my feet during breakfast from now on, and if I enjoy your performance, maybe I’ll let you eat out of my hand,” she said, with a predatory smile.

I raised my eyebrows, “Are you sure? I might make it hard for you to concentrate on your food.”

“Oh I’ll find some way to pay you back, I think I’ll make it a surprise. After all, turnabout is fair play,” she said, as she stood, and walked around the table towards me.

*Uh oh. Watch your ass Quinn, maybe literally.*

She lifted my chin with one finger, though we were already basically at eyelevel, despite the fact that I was sitting “Now, are you going to show me your little surprise or not? And be warned, if it’s anything like last night, know that the retribution will be even more substantial. Though that’s not to say I don’t want to see your little surprise.”

-----

Lady Chypia sat on the bed, watching with interest and confusion as I hung the hammock. It had taken some effort to find something sturdy enough to hold the weight, but thankfully the canopied bed was solidly built, and I strung the hammock diagonally across the bed.

“I’m still not quite sure what this is meant to do,” she said, giving me a look.

“Come here,” I said, snatching her up, and she gave a little yelp.

I’d hung the hammock as high as it could go, I wasn’t sure how Lady Chypia felt about heights, but anything to keep her off balance would do.

I deposited her in the hammock, before climbing in myself.

“Careful! Careful!” she exclaimed, when the hammock twisted as I was getting in.

It seemed that she wasn’t very fond of heights after all, and she clung rigidly to me as the hammock settled.

*And I thought that this would be less interesting than the other night. Oh, I am going to scare the hell out of her.*

“Do you not like heights m’Lady?” I asked innocently, looking down at where she was flattened against my chest, trying to stay as low as possible.

“I’m four and a half feet tall,” she said, with quick, clipped words, “How would **you** like the idea of sleeping perched on the edge of the roof?”

Absently I started rocking back and forth. The truth was, I was pretty afraid of heights, but the hammock wasn’t much more than six feet from the floor right now.

“Quinn….” She said warningly.

“Oh m’Lady, you’re insatiable. Fine, if you insist,” I said, and I grabbed her by the waist.

I sat her up on top of me, pulling her nightie up and over her head. She yelped again, trying to press herself back down, but I caught her by the shoulders and held her upright. Sitting up only gave her a better view of just how high up she was, and it probably didn’t help that we were rocking back and forth quite a bit by now.

“Yeep! You stoppit!” she said, beating her tiny fists against my chest.

*Just once, I’d like to have a healthy physical and emotional relationship with someone, where the whole thing wasn’t fucked up in any way. Still zero for three.*

I let her back down, and I shifted so she could lay beside me instead of on top of me. She settled down after a while, and once she did relax, she demanded my attention. It wasn’t quite as animated as the last couple of times, but I enjoyed the way that she’d squeak whenever the hammock shifted too much as we moved around.

-----

Lady Chypia nearly dumped the two of us out of the hammock the following morning, I think she’d forgotten just where she was sleeping, and I woke with a start as I felt the hammock tip dramatically. I grabbed her, pulling her to my chest, before she could roll out of the hammock and fall to the floor. She went from bleary eyed sleepiness, to wide awake in an instant, and it felt like she was trying to push herself into me. I rubbed her shoulders and made soothing sounds, it took a moment, but she relaxed.

“Humans must all be mad,” she said, a little breathlessly, “You’d think that with so few years available, you’d be more careful with the years you do have.”

“I’m plenty careful, a hammock isn’t *that* dangerous.”

“What about when we first met? With your hands tied, you swam from a ship at sea, all the way to the coast. I should have known then that humans were crazy.”

“Well I was very strongly motivated, and if I hadn’t done that then I’d never have met you,” I said, kissing the top of her head, “What ever happened to Enutur anyway?”

“The captain of that mail carrier? He left the same night you arrived. That was probably smart of him, the Alkides family would have held him responsible for the damage to their ship and the death of its captain.”

“Oh, so I did end up killing him then?” I asked, not quite sure if I should feel guilty or satisfied.

“Yes, the damn fool’s armour dragged him down, I don’t think they managed to retrieve the body either. He’ll still be at the bottom of the sea somewhere.”

“And they’d hold Enutur, and not me, responsible for that?” I asked, somewhat confused.

“Well, I might have neglected to mention just how I acquired you. I’m sure that some of the soldiers that saw you might recognize you, but that’s only four or five people that even know of the connection. If they saw you, and if they cared to make a fuss, it wouldn’t be hard for me to discredit them. Or I could just bribe them, and then as far as they knew, you’d be at the bottom of the sea, just like the captain.”

“How did Enutur get away? It was some distance off, but the ship looked like it was in pretty rough shape,” I asked, remembering the damage to the flank of the ship, where the Adympian trireme had gone nose-in.

“I’m guessing that all of the damage was above the waterline,” she said, as she shifted around on top of me to get more comfortable, “because I haven’t heard about any shipwrecks since he left.”

“Damn, the bastard still has all of my things then. I guess he didn’t try to sell any of it before he left?”

“No, feeling a little homesick? Looking for a memento?” she asked, genuinely seeming to care.

I sighed, “Not really though something like the body of the Maglite would have made a good reservoir for the air gun. Actually, do you still have my coat somewhere?”

“Yes, why?” She asked.

The coat, being an article of clothing, was definitely a powerful reminder of home. A reminder of not being a slave, this was the same reason she’d given me Adympian clothing since day one. My jeans and t-shirt had not been returned either, hell, I hadn’t even gotten my underwear back.

“Well I can probably cut it apart, the same thing that makes the fabric waterproof should also make it airtight. You remember the leather air bladder I’m trying to get working? If I made a bladder out of the material of my coat then I bet that would solve most of the problems I’m having.”

*There you go Lady Chypia, let me tear up the one reminder of home, and render it into a shape to serve you.*

“Mmm, well it’s in the trunk over there,” she said, nodding towards one wall, where a small chest sat next to an armoire.

I made an appreciative sound, and we talked for a little while longer, before she finally demanded I carry her to the bath.

-----

I checked the chest she’d pointed out to me after breakfast, and found not only my coat, but the rest of my clothes piled inside. Everything had been washed and folded after my swim, and I took the coat out, leaving the rest of my things.

*Side quest one, complete.*

I’d be able to get to them later, so there was no sense in rushing. I needed a second set of clothes after all, to change into once I finished my swim, and they would do very nicely.

-----

The next few days passed rather uneventfully, with everything becoming rather routine. I’d bathe with Lady Chypia in the morning, which always took about twice as long as it should have. We’d have breakfast together, and then I’d go off to work on the air gun or my escape preparations in my workshop. We’d have lunch together, and then I’d be off to the library for the afternoon. Erilon and Cusole handled most of the day to day work, but there was still some minor bookkeeping for me to handle, and the two of them would brief me on how Lady Chypia’s business was going. I was meant to be her steward, as well as her bed warmer, which meant that I needed to be properly acquainted with her affairs. I’d be making management decisions after all, assuming I stuck around, so most of the time in the afternoon was spent getting up to speed. Come evening I’d have some free time before dinner, and I’d read whatever book caught my interest. I’d been looking specifically for books on herbology, and while Lady Chypia did have a few, none were particularly detailed. I was hoping for some mystical and magical equivalent to penicillin, but I had no such luck.

I did find references to Alchemy though, which I found very interesting. According to what little I’d found on the topic, it was a sort of magic that nearly anyone could learn, thought it was said to be even more difficult to use than the innate magic used by Mages or Wizards.

*Is that healing salve Lady Chypia has an alchemical creation?*

Finally I’d have dinner with Lady Chypia, and she’d drag me to bed immediately after. I held off trying anything else adventurous, I was well aware that I was still due some retribution, and our activities were decidedly more vanilla. Though with Lady Chypia even vanilla still seemed to involve a lot of biting and scratching on her part.

As time wore on I started to feel things changing between us, at least from my perspective. I felt her grip on me loosening, and it loosened just a little bit more every night. I’d been a little starved for physical attention before landing in this new world, though that was mostly my own fault, and since arriving here I’d been far too eager to change that. It’s the eagerness, I’d realized, that had made my relationships over the past six months more than a little messed up. It was especially clear to me, now that I was here in Ventia with Chypia. By all rights I should be perfectly satisfied, after all, wasn’t I getting exactly what I’d wanted? A sixteen year old Quinn would been absolutely ecstatic, “To hell with Nimre,” he would have said. But as time wore on, and I accumulated more scratches and bites from Chypia, I realized just how empty it all was. How empty it still was, and the more I became aware of that, the more I was free of Chypia’s influence. I still acted the part, but now it was truly an act, and no longer did I feel as if the act was for myself instead of Chypia.

-----

I was ready to leave, at least in theory, about a week after I finished the hammock. I’d come up with solutions to the rest of my problems, and even gotten the airgun working.

Problem one had been food, and that had been solved easily enough. I’d been thinking about trying to make pemmican, or maybe hard tack, but I didn’t really need that much food. It didn’t need to keep that long either, so I settled for raw fruits and vegetables. I could pick them up on the last day, and stash them with the rest of my escape kit for that night. The fruit would keep for a couple days, and the vegetables for a couple more, and they were relatively calorie dense so didn’t take up a lot of space.

Problem two had been sleeping accommodations, which was obviously solved with the hammock and oilskin tarp. The tarp also doubled as a waterproof container when I wrapped it up tight, using the ties normally meant to hang it from trees, to keep it closed. My food, money, spare clothing, multitool, and knife, would go in there.

Problem three had been the money. I’d accounted for eighteen days of travel, with me arriving in Nimre on noon of the eighteenth day. Five or six of those days would be in Adympia which meant staying away from inns, so that meant roughly thirteen days’ worth of funds to pay for room and board. I’d aimed for twenty six drachm, which should keep me covered even if it was more expensive here than in Rhona. I’d been luckier than that though, and had managed to embezzle fifty drachm from my assassination budget.

Problem four had been to remove the cuffs, and I’d thought that I had a brilliant solution to this problem. I was rather wrong. I’d broken into one of the abandoned mills that I’d seen during my walk with Chypia the week before, thinking that if a file wouldn’t get through the cuffs, then I could use what was basically a massive water powered grinding wheel. This was not the case, and while I’d evaded detection as I broke in, the millstone was designed for grain, not metal. All it had done was scratch the finish a little, which had taken me some time in my workshop to cover up. Hopefully my jacket would cover them from view if I ran into anyone on my way out of Adympia, and once I was beyond the border, hopefully no one would care. I might even get a little help, depending on how the Ashurians felt about runaway slaves.

Problem five would be solved by swimming, which I still thought was a terrible idea. I’d made a long leather bladder, and passed it off as a test for the air gun. In fact, it would be my flotation device. I’d tie the tarp and the things inside to what was basically a big inflatable pontoon, and I’d use it to help me stay afloat and away from the seawall as I swam to freedom. I’d been keeping track of the tides over the past week, and would leave just when the tide was at its highest. It wouldn’t really be flowing in or out which should make the swim more manageable, and if I did end up taking too long, the tide would at least help carry me out. I did hope to be clear of the harbour well before then though.

The airgun I’d made a few canisters for, and the valve I’d created seemed to work well. Inside the canister was a little metal disc, larger than the opening that would feed the air through the barrel. When pressurized the disc would be pressed against the opening, sealing the canister. All you’d need to do to fire the airgun would be to press the canister into the little nub on the end of the barrel. I’d refined this when I built it into the cane. All you’d need to do is hold the cane firmly in both hands, point at the target, and push down on the top of the cane. It acted as a plunger, which would force the canister over the barrel. The seal was good, and the canister drained very quickly. Enes and Chypia were pleased when I’d shown them how it was used, it had put a wooden needle right through a stiff piece of cloth, and into a pork leg being used as a target. I’d switched to a wooden needle in the hope that it might just be confused for a nasty splinter. Nusalvo would find the needle whether it was bronze or wood, but bronze at least would raise some questions. The wooden needle also made it easier to deliver the poison, as it could be allowed to seep into and coat the wood. I’d leave Chypia with five canisters and five more of the treated needles.

I’d been worried about carrying my many things down to the harbour in the middle of the night, but thankfully the cloth merchants had solved that problem for me. Their little ‘factory’ was very near the waterfront, and Chypia had involved me in the business once the planned acquisition went ahead. I’d found an unused chest, stuck a lock on it, and told the underpaid and overworked manager that it was full of Chypia’s things. He didn’t argue, and wasn’t likely to talk to Chypia directly. Over the next few days I’d dropped my things off inside, and they were none the wiser. The only thing not waiting for me in that chest would be my Earth clothing, since of all my things they were the most likely to be noticed missing.

I was ready to go, the only question was, “When?” I didn’t want Chypia waking up in the middle of the night to find me missing. Hell, just getting out of her grip without waking her would be an ordeal in and of itself.

-----

We had dinner in her room that night, which should have tipped me off that there was something suspicious going on, but unfortunately I didn’t notice until it was too late. It was a very nice dinner, cooked salmon, assorted greens, and white wine. I’d never been very fond of drink and had been leaving the wine mostly untouched. Chypia had been prodding me to enjoy it, which also should have raised my suspicion, so to satisfy her I finished the wine in a few short gulps once I was done with the fish. Chypia smiled like a shark the moment I put the wineglass down, and it was only then that I realized my mistake.

My vision swam, and I slumped out of the chair and onto the floor, unconscious.

-----

I woke, to find myself tied to the bed, naked.

*I guess turnabout is fair play, but I really have places to be.*

I could hear Chypia moving about the room, but the curtains on the canopied bed had been lowered, so I couldn’t see quite what she was doing. She must have heard the mattress shift, because she pulled apart the curtains at the foot of the bed to look at me lying there. She was naked, sweaty, and her hair was a mess. Heaving me onto the bed must have taken quite a bit of effort on her part.

“Well, don’t you seem excited,” she said, with a wry expression on her face as she looked at me.

“Maybe once I’ve spent some time on my new throne,” she said, patting my cheek, “We’ll see if you’ve earned some of my attention. I hope you can hold your breath for a long while, I might take some time to get comfortable on my new seat. I’ll leave you to think about that while I get cleaned up.”

I groaned as she closed the curtains and walked to the bathroom. I heard the taps turn on, and the tub start to fill with water. She always liked taking her time in the bath. It took me quite a while to calm down so I could think straight, I might have been slightly worked up. Once I did calm myself though I realized that I probably could still leave tonight. In fact, I could even get myself a pretty substantial headstart.

I cast Apportation, and freed myself in short order. I was very quiet as I moved around, I didn’t want her to realized that I’d freed myself, and I located both sets of my clothing. The Earth set was still in that trunk, and my Adympian clothes were scattered near where I’d passed out. I was slightly alarmed by what I found at the foot of the bed though. She had quite the collection of implements, none seemed like they’d be particularly painful, but they definitely catered to Chypia’s brand of torture.

*I only wish I had time to try half this stuff on her, but I’ve got places to be.*

I picked up a few choice pieces though, and pressed myself against the wall, next to the door. When it opened I’d be concealed behind it, and hopefully I’d be able to catch Chypia unawares as she walked towards the bed. She took her sweet time in the bath, and I had to check my watch to make sure that I wasn’t going to overrun my timetable by having my fun. It turned out I was fine, I’d only been unconscious for half an hour or so, and we’d had dinner early. I had hours until I need to be on my way. Chypia spent one of those hours in the bath, she was really taking her time with this, I was a little impressed. Eventually though I heard her rise, and the tub start to drain. There was a rustling as she dried herself off, and then the door opened. She walked slowly towards the bed, hips swaying as she did.

“Oh Quinnnnnnn,” she said in a sing song voice.

“Yes m’Lady?” I asked from right behind her.

I caught her before she could say anything, pulling her arms behind her back and clamping a hand over her mouth. She struggled, but I managed to get her own cuffs around her wrists, binding her arms behind her back. She kicked her legs at me, but I managed to get a second pair of cuffs around those as well. I stood over her, rather appreciating the look of her wriggling around on the floor.

“No fair!” she said, “Do you know how much work it was to find everything?”

“Well, don’t worry, you’ll still get to enjoy some of it,” I said smugly, as I picked her up, carrying her towards the bed.

“I’m still going to pay you back for this. Especially now!” She said, trying to seem angry, though the effect was rather ruined by the humour that crept into her voice.

I took the silk ropes she’d used to bind my feet to the bedposts, and used those to tie her into position at the end of the bed. She was left kneeling over the end of the bed, and unable to move from her **very** exposed position.

“If you ever tell anyone about this,” she said, trying to turn to look at me, “I swear I will lock you in a closet and only let you out when I want somewhere interesting to sit.”

“Oh don’t worry,” I said, as I checked the knots, “This is just between us. This is why you keep me around after all, isn’t it?”

“Maybe, but you had better make this worth it,” she said, starting threatening, but ending with her dusky voice.

“Oh trust me, I will, now open up,” I instructed.

She narrowed her eyes at me, but obliged, and I slipped a gag into her mouth. The next thing on was a silk blindfold, and she was reduced to muffled moaning. I looked at my watch, and then at the little collection she’d laid out at the end of the bed.

*Damn, there’s quite the collection here, I only wish I had the time.*

I felt both guilty and extraordinarily pleased with the thought of Aris or Pasa coming in to check on her, only to find her in her current state. Then I started laughing manically, *oh yes Quinn, that idea is even better.*

“Now it’s my turn to leave you waiting,” I said to her, still giggling to myself, as I went to have a quick bath.

I didn’t take long, I was going to end up in the harbour shortly anyway. I dried and dressed hurriedly, wearing the Adympian clothes. Chypia was still there, still tied up on the end of the bed, and I leaned in beside her ear to speak. It would be best to keep the charade going as long as possible.

“I’m going to go down to my workshop to get something I’ve been preparing especially for you,” I said, and this illicited a frustrated, yet pleased, moan, “Now don’t you go anywhere, I’ll be back, eventually.”

Instead, I went to find Aris and Pasa.

-----

I found the little room where they slept now that I was ‘serving’ Chypia, and tapped lightly on the door. I heard a stirring in the room, and tapped lightly on the door again. There was a flurry of movement, and the door was pulled open to reveal the two of them standing there primly, despite their sleepy faces and mussed hair.

“Yes Quinn?” they said at the same time, “What do you need?”

“It’s not actually what I need,” I said, very seriously, “Lady Chypia has a task for you.”

They seemed to perk up at this, and Pasa asked, “Anything for our Lady, what is it?”

“Our Lady requires the attention of both of you come six o’ clock. I think that it will be made rather more clear once you go into our bedroom, but she’ll be waiting for you,” I explained, and I had to try **very** hard not to burst into laughter.

“Oh? What does she want us to do for her?” Aris asked.

“It’s not what you’re meant to do for her, it’s what you’re going to do **to** her. Do you understand me?” I asked seriously.

They both took a moment, but I saw the look in their eyes as they understood.

“From what she’s told me, she doesn’t have you do this sort of thing often, does she?”

“No, never,” Pasa said, with a grin from ear to ear.

“This is going to be so much fun,” Aris said, almost jumping up and down.

“Now there are some rules, and you **must** follow them. Lady Chypia has gone to a lot of effort to set this up understand? And my part in it was quite an exercise, you can’t go and ruin all the work put into this, understood?”

They both nodded very seriously, though I saw the heat in their eyes, “What are the rules Quinn?” Pasa asked.

“First, you’re not allowed to untie her, no matter how much she struggles, or how much noise she makes”

“Untie her? Oh-ho-ho-ho-ho,” Aris said, they both looked absolutely ecstatic, “What else? What else?”

“Second, you can’t ungag her, or remove the blindfold either. Same rules, no matter what, understand?” They nodded, big stupid grins plastered across their faces, and I continued, “Third, you have to use every single toy she has laid out. It will be clear once you see her room, but she’s got quite the collection, and you need to use them all.”

They were hugging each other now, listening eagerly as I went on, “Finally, you don’t stop until noon. So from six o’clock in the morning, until noon, understand? And you can’t let her get bored, so don’t be afraid to try different… areas.”

“Different areas?” Aris asked innocently, though Pasa had an evil grin.

“Oh I think Pasa knows what Lady Chypia wants, or rather where she wants it, but I’ve left one of her toys in place if you need a hint.”

“This is going to be so much fun!” Pasa said, clearly already thinking of all the trouble she could get up to.

“Just remember,” I said, bending down to eye level, “This is serious. Lady Chypia said that she was only doing this to let you two both know how much she trusts you both. So make sure you follow all of the rules. I’ve got to go back up there, she’s not done with me yet, but come six o’clock it’s your turn to take over. I’ll make sure to get out of your way ahead of time, you’ll have her all to yourself.”

“Thank you thank you thank you Quinn,” they chorused, lurching forwards to wrap their arms around me.

*Man, the stuff I come up with.*

“We’ll make sure to follow every rule exactly,” Aris said, and Pasa nodded along with her.

“Well,” I hedged, “Every rule except stopping at noon. That one’s more of a minimum requirement.”

“Minimum requirement?” Aris asked.

“She doesn’t want you to stop before noon,” I explained, “But that doesn’t mean you need to stop **at** noon. If you think you can keep her entertained you can keep going until I’m back for dinner.”

“Yes!” Pasa said.

“This is going to be great!” Aris said.

“Now, you two get some sleep. Our Lady will need you two to be good and rested if you’re going to attend to her tomorrow.”

“Yes Quinn! Thank you Quinn!” They chorused, before hurrying back into their room.

*It’s too bad I won’t be here to see it.*

-----

I hurried out of the manor, sneaking out through the window of a disused room, and headed for the clothier’s factory. I stopped my sneaking once I was clear of the manor’s grounds, standing tall. No one outside of the manor would know that I wasn’t meant to be out, and sneaking would only draw suspicion. I walked confidently, just as if I was on a late night errand for my Lady, and walked right past a guard patrol on my way to the factory. The chest was sitting right where I’d left it, and was still locked tight. I opened it to find my things waiting for me, and stowed my Earth clothes before wrapping the bundle back up. I hurried down to the waterfront, along the wall.

I checked the illuminated face of my watch, I was right on time. I had my little leather pontoon inflated quickly, and eased myself quietly down from a dock and into the water. It was both fairly warm, and quite clean. Thankfully the city didn’t make a habit of dumping their trash and sewage into the bay. I settled the pontoon under my arms, and made sure that the oilskin bundle wasn’t about to break loose. Once I was happy with my preparations, I pushed off, to Nimre, and to freedom.

I used the rough stones of the wall to pull myself along while I kicked with my legs, and I made good time to the opening of the sea wall. I realized that I’d made an error once I got to the opening though, I may have been a little hasty leaving so quickly. The harbour had been shaded, and the water was almost pitch black. Unfortunately for me, the water outside the harbour shone like a sheet of stars. The sky was absolutely clear, and the full moon cast it’s light down on the sea. I was committed though, and just hoped that no one would think to look down along the bottom of the wall where it met the sea.

*Don’t worry Quinn, it’s not like elf eyesight is far better than human eyesight or anything.*

I managed to get to shore without a cry going up though, and I pulled myself quietly out of the water. I stuck close to the edge of the beach, where the sand met a sort of embankment before rising to meet the road that ran along the coast. The embankment shielded me from the view of anyone watching from the gate, and hopefully the odd shapes and shadows cast by the moonlight would break up my outline and make it hard for anyone on the sea wall to pick me out. I settled into a light jog, hunched over just a little to keep my head below the embankment, and headed for the border.

I pulled myself up the embankment once I’d gotten a kilometre or two down the beach. I was still in sight of the city, especially if elven eyesight was as good as I thought, but there was a bit of tree cover here. My immediate goal was to find a place to sleep. According to my watch it wasn’t quite midnight yet, and I wanted to get some sleep as soon as possible. I had at least a six hour head start, assuming Aris and Pasa recognized the trick immediately. If I ran now and slept later I’d probably still be asleep when whoever was chasing me would catch me. Sleeping now would mean being closer to the city once they set out, but at least I’d be rested and already on the move. Hopefully though, I’d have another six hours on top of that, maybe more.

As long as I got those extra six hours I should be okay. It wasn’t a great head start, especially since my pursuers would likely be on horseback, but horses had their own problems. I’d accounted for sixty miles per day when I was planning my trip back in Essens, and while that would be reduced a bit as I stayed off the roads, it was a pretty good pace. I knew almost nothing about horses, so I guessed that they’d be able to do eighty miles a day when I was planning my escape, with their pace also slowed by needing to track me. Without the extra six hours I estimated that they’d catch up with me near noon on the last day I’d spend in Adympia. With the head start, I’d be within an hour or two of the border when they caught up. The question then would be how precisely they could track me. If I was lucky they might ‘catch up’, only to never spot me. Of course, there was no way I’d be that lucky.

I paused, as I was stringing up the hammock, to look down at the cuffs I was still wearing. ‘Abjuration’ had been what Detect Magic had called the class of enchantment used on the cuffs, but the closest thing to a definition I had for that had come out of the Dungeon Master’s Guide. It was clear that they were far tougher than they should be, but what other enchantments might they carry?

*With my luck? A tracking enchantment. It’s what I’d do.*

If I was right, that would mean my pursuers would be right on top of me when they finally did catch up. No cat and mouse, no clever sneaking past through the underbrush. A human might be able to outpace a horse over long distances, but a horse was going to be a hell of a lot faster in the short term. If they caught up early that day I’d be screwed, the horses would be fresh from a long rest, and there’d be no way to get clear. If they caught up late though? Well then I’d have a chance, they’d be tired from nearly a full day of hard riding. I probably still wouldn’t be able to outrun them, but it would make outmanoeuvring them a lot easier.

I stripped out of my wet clothes, and changed into my Earth clothes to sleep. I’d gone some distance inland, well away from the road, in some light forests. It was still not quite as much cover as I would have liked, but I wasn’t likely to find anything very much better than this. I hung my wet clothes over some branches to dry, I’d be changing back into them for the journey tomorrow, and pulled myself up into the hammock. I laid my jacket across myself, though it was a warm night, and did my best to fall asleep.

It did take me a little while to relax, and I found myself thinking back to the way that I’d arranged my head start. At the time I’d thought it absolutely hilarious, and it was one hell of a way to knock Chypia down a few pegs. But once I had time to stop and think, I started to see what I’d done in a new light. Chypia seemed to enjoy our little struggles for control, at least within the boundaries of her bedroom, but this was different. Fooling around in the tub, or scaring her when I’d first made the hammock was one thing, this was different. Chypia at least had played along a little, but she’d likely thought of it as more of the same. She had no idea that I’d planned for her to be tied up for another twelve hours. Would she be okay with that? Definitely not. If that’s all I’d arranged for, then I wouldn’t have had a second thought. But I didn’t do that. I didn’t go to Aris and Pasa, and tell them to avoid disturbing Chypia until noon. I told them to go in there and amuse themselves, at great expense to Chypia. Worse still, as far as they knew they’d be doing as she’d ordered. As far as they knew, her struggling and muffled protests would all part of the game. Was doing all this worse than killing her? Most people would forgive a slave for killing their master to escape. Hell, some would celebrate it.

*Was this worse? Maybe it was.*

-----

I managed to get to sleep eventually, and when I woke my watch reported that it was 7:00am, July-22. I’d been on this planet for two hundred and three days. I changed back into the clothes that I’d left to dry, and packed up my Earth clothes. I planned to save them for once I was clear of Adympia, they’d draw attention, but so would the garb of an Adympian steward. Besides, once I was done with Adympia, I was going to be **done** with Adympia and that included their clothes.

I took my bearings from the sun, and headed west towards the border. I stayed away from the road, but did my best to avoid traveling through forested areas, instead following the tree line. If things went well I’d have no one after me until noon, and even then they’d only be a touch faster than I. That meant getting as much of a lead as I could manage, which meant sticking to ground I could cover more quickly.

Three o’clock rolled around, and I hadn’t yet been run down and dragged back in chains, which was nice. Chypia’s torment would have ended two or three hours ago, and they would have started to chase me maybe an hour after that. My head start was over, and the chase was on. I started to edge north a little, in preparation for my pursuers. It would bring me further from the roads, and into the forest. I was not terribly impressed with Adympian forests, it was much more sparse than the evergreen forests I’d been used to in Canada, but hopefully it would be enough to slow the horses down. I was careful, as I walked, to keep track of the sun’s position in the sky. It’s easier that you think to get lost in a forest, and I didn’t want to end up walking in circles, waiting for whoever Chypia sent to catch me.

I didn’t stop that night until the sun was well and truly below the horizon. Everything I knew about horses came from fantasy novels, but I hoped that they’d have trouble traveling at night through rough terrain, so I pushed on as long as I could. It wasn’t until the glow from the setting sun was completely gone that I’d stopped. I had the energy to keep going, but the last thing I wanted to do was get lost in a forest at night. Instead I found a place to hang my hammock for the night, and planned for the inevitable confrontation.

My resources were fairly limited. I had my knife and the multitool, my watch, all four of my rings, my pen, and one waterproof jacket. But I also had magic, though admittedly, not a whole hell of a lot of it. Using magic would also mean that surrender was not an option, though my little stunt with Chypia had probably already seen to that. She was not going to be pleased with me if she caught me. I had the mana stones set into the ring, I’d found out early on that they recharged themselves in about a day, which did give me an extra 4 mana. That did mean that Ignite was a possibility, I could dump in three mana and try to catch someone in the face with it, though it would be tricky. Apportation was the other spell of note if it came to a fight. Throwing rocks wasn’t a terribly good use for the spell, but that wasn’t all I could do. I knew from my very extensive testing with Thera’s aid that I could create long, thick, and flexible… rods. They were rods. It was a strange thought, blocking a sword or a spear with a magical sex toy, but it would work. Just like I could bat away a weapon with my hand, I could do it with Apportation. The difference was that the manipulators couldn’t be hurt, though the force I could apply was reduced. It wasn’t perfect, it seemed that other people could ‘resist’ my interference if they didn’t make a conscious decision to consent, but I’d been able to overcome the resistance put up by both Thera and Sila when they’d helped in testing the spell. Basic Illusion and Sound were the other two spells I could get a use out of, and the other contender for mana stone use. Basic Illusion could hide me, though if I was right and the bracers held a tracking enchantment that might not matter, and Sound could distract them.

*I would kill for a wand of Magic Missile right now.*

-----

I pressed on over the next three days, getting up early, and pushing hard all day, not stopping until the sun was well below the horizon. It was spring here in Adympia, which meant I was traveling about twelve hours a day. It was hard going, but it was about what I’d planned for anyways, all those months ago in Essens. I realized, as I woken on what would be my last day in Adympia, that Thera would have arrived in Nimre by now.

*It’s a good thing we took different ships. If what Chypia said is true then Thera’s probably fine, but if I’d been there and the captain was the unscrupulous sort then they might have handed over* ***all*** *of their passengers.*

I yawned as I sat up in the hammock, feeling surprisingly good. I’d been setting one hell of a pace over the past four days, but I felt damn good. Running or biking for exercise was one thing, it was a different thing altogether to do it constantly for four days straight. It was a strange feeling to describe, but along with the soreness in my limbs, I also felt a strength. That if I had to, I could keep doing this for as long as it took to reach my goal.

*Well, as long as I have food.*

I had enough for today, and the day after. Beyond that, I’d need to find a village or town. Hopefully once I reached Ashur I could continue my normal traveling strategy of inn hopping. I packed up my belongings, wrapping them back up in the oilskin, and set out on my way. I ate my meal of assorted vegetables as I walked, while I was getting rather bored of vegetarianism, at least I didn’t need to cook anything. That meant no fires to give me away, no time wasted preparing food, and no time wasted sitting down to eat.

With very little warning I felt the air grow suddenly cold, and I paused to pull my jacket out of my bundle of belongings. I looked around as I stood there, conscious of the fact that depending on how well my trick worked, my pursuers could be only a short distance away. I didn’t see any horsemen, *horsepeople?* burst out of the brush to run me through, but I did notice the trees swaying. I looked up to see the wind shaking the treetops violently. I was somewhat protected by the forest, but the driving wind was tearing leaves and small branches free to fall to the forest floor.

The closer I grew to the border the rougher the terrain got. I was out of the plains that surrounded Ventia, and moving into the hills that characterized the border territory between Adympia and Ashur. I’d know when I found the border, because there’d be a damn big river.

*Because going swimming always works so well for me*

I had planned for this though, and the leather pontoon that I’d used to float myself out of Ventia was laid across my pack so I could get at it quickly. Whoever was chasing me would probably be right on my heels as I ran for the river, and I wanted to be able to get at it quickly.  

-----

I started to get a little more tense as my watch ticked closer and closer to noon, and I stopped on a hill to try to get a look back down my trail, careful not to silhouette myself against the sky. The wind had not lessened over the past few hours, if anything it had gotten worse, and I was very aware of that as I lay peeking over the hill. I didn’t spot anyone following me, but I did see the truly massive cloud bank rolling in from the east. They were dark grey, almost black, and I could see lightning flashing through the clouds.

*Well that’s not ominous at all.*

I pushed myself up, heading down the hill, and I had to make a conscious effort to not break into a jog. Instead I paced myself, I was going to need every bit of energy I had once my pursuers caught up with me.

-----

The rain started to fall around 2pm, though ‘fall’ didn’t really describe just what was happening. The tree cover helped to some extent, but the rain was streaking sideways, and it stung my face when I made the mistake of turning to look behind me. I was glad that I’d managed to recover my jacket, hopefully the riders following me were miserable. Assuming anyone was following me. All this planning for what ‘the riders’ and ’my pursuers’ might be doing, it would be kinda underwhelming if no one was after me.

*Am I that lucky?*

-----

No. No I was not.

I could **see** the river from my perch on the hill, unfortunately I could also see three people on horseback. The two larger riders wore armour and carried long spears, the other was small, unarmoured, and wrapped in an oilskin cloak. *Chypia?* It was hard to tell, but it looked like Maybe-Chypia was looking down at something held in her hand. The group was about a kilometre away.

*That would be the tracker.*

I looked back down towards the river, it was maybe two kilometres away. I looked back, even if that was a tracker, I bet I could distract the hell out of them if they spotted a little Quinn illusion stand up and start running. I cast my spell at the bottom of the hill behind a clump of bushes. I kept it in line between myself and the riders, I didn’t want Chypia to notice that what she saw and what the tracker said didn’t make sense. I gave it a second, making sure that one of the armoured riders was watching in the bushes direction, and then had not-Quinn bolt towards the south. One of the riders raised a cry immediately, and I had not-Quinn sprint to and slide down a short depression. I ended the spell the second he was out of sight from them. I wanted to continue it on longer, Chypia would probably look down at the tracker the second she lost track of the illusion, but I could barely hold the spell together at that distance.

*Run. Now.*

I pushed myself up off the hill, and started to run. There weren’t a lot of options when it came to places to hide, and the trees were too sparse and too small to be able to give any real cover. They’d see me almost immediately once they came around the hill, not that it would make much of a difference with that tracker. I could use the illusion spell again, though apparently not at the range I wanted to, but I’d probably need to be stationary for that. And I did not want to spend much time stationary. I cast a few copies of Apportation as I ran.

I was maybe a couple hundred metres from the river when I heard thundering hooves behind me, and I threw myself sideways behind a tree. There was a crack of wood on wood, and a charging horse bowled through the space I’d just occupied. It was Enes on the back of the horse, and she fumbled to keep a hold of her spear. I scrambled up off the ground, and Enes tried to turn her horse around, though the horse was caught up on a tree. I ran behind her and to the left as she tried to turn right to face me.
I looked around as I ran, trying to locate the other riders. I did not want to get boxed in. I’d lucked out, it looked like the other armoured rider, probably Amas, had been on Enes’s right. The last rider had been a bit behind those two, and turned to chase me.

“QUINN!” Aris screamed, and her voice sounded rough, “QUINN!”

*Not Chypia then*

“PLEASE QUINN!” She screamed, though the end came out as a cough.

I looked to my right, Enes was still getting her horse turned around, but Amas was after me. She had her spear tucked under her arm, but it was reversed, the butt of the spear was facing forwards. I reached out with Apportation, pushing back hard on one of the horse’s hooves just as it was about to set its weight down on that leg. I felt the same resistance I had when testing with Sila and Thera, but it was noticeably less than it had been for those two. The horse’s weight came down, but the hoof wasn’t there, and the horse screamed as it fell forwards.

I looked to my left, Aris was gaining on me, though she wasn’t looking at me. She was distracted, looking towards the screaming horse, her already huge eyes even wider. I was close to the river now, and I could see where the ground sloped away towards the water. I glanced back towards Amas, she’d hesitated as she seemed to consider stopping for Enes, she’d been pinned by her horse and was struggling to get free.

“Go! I’ll help her, GO!” Aris shouted as she half leaped, half fell from her horse to land roughly beside Enes.

Amas caught up with me just as I reached the top of the slope. It was a hell of a lot steeper than I’d thought, and with the grass slick from the rainfall it might as well have been a sheet of ice. I heard her scream, and I turned to see her swinging the butt of her spear, directly at my head. I raised my arm to protect my face, and threw one of my manipulators in the path of the spear. It dampened the blow, but the heavy haft of wood carried through it to smash into my arm, and the very tip just barley caught me in the face. I screamed as I fell backwards, my arm felt like it was on fire, and I could feel hot blood running down into my eyes. I tumbled down the slope headfirst, and scrambled to try to right myself or slow my fall. I caught hold of a tree about half way down the slope. Well, when I say caught, what I really mean is that my back slammed into it which brought me to a halt.

“Quinn you son of a whore!” Amas screamed at me from the top of the hill, horse unable to make it down safely.

I could barely make out her features. I’d lost my glasses when she’d hit me in the face. I felt at my arm, and at my legs. Both hurt like hell, but both worked. I looked down towards the rushing water, at least I thought it was rushing, it was awfully hard to tell. It didn’t look like very much fun, but I pulled the stupid leather pontoon from where it was tied to my pack and inflated it as fast as I could. I looked back towards the top of the hill, to see Amas clambering off of her horse, while screaming incoherently at me.

*She seems unhappy with me for some reason.*

I got the pontoon inflated, and made sure I had a solid grip on it before sliding down what remained of the hill. I managed to control my descent fairly well, and while I collected some more scrapes, I didn’t smash into any more obstacles. I hit the water feet first, which of course was freezing cold, and started kicking out into the middle of it. I was carried away quickly by the fast current, and Amas’s screaming faded into the distance, covered by the rushing water and pouring rain. Even with the pontoon it was a fight to keep my head above water in the rushing river. The current would carry me downstream and fighting against that would be useless, but there was nothing stopping me from swimming across it, I focused on swimming for the far bank.

I was about half way across the river when I suddenly felt a blinding pain. In one moment I felt tired, sore, I could hear my ragged breaths, and the uncomfortable squelch of my soaked clothing. In the next moment, all of that was overwhelmed by an unimaginable pain in my forearms. It didn’t stop either, and it took a moment for me to realize where I was, and just what I should be doing. It was all I could do to keep my grip on the pontoon, and I kicked my legs, trying to get to shore. The pain was immense, and my vision was nothing but a white void. I could hear myself screaming whenever I wasn’t gasping for breath or coughing up water, and an eternity later I felt myself bump against something. My legs found the riverbed and I tried to stand, only to fall forwards again. I scrambled up the riverbank and onto dry land, feeling blindly at sand, pebbles, roots, and clumps of grass. I thrashed around in the sand and dirt beside the river, screaming and tearing uselessly at the cuffs.

It felt like it took an eternity, but eventually I got my breath. I don’t know how long I’d been there, and by the time I managed to focus it was well after sundown. The pain had not let up at all, but at least I could see straight now. I managed to get my feet under me, and I patted around weakly for my things. I was still wearing my jacket, though it and my clothes were a muddy mess, and still had the bundle, though the pontoon must have floated away. I’d managed to stop myself from screaming, but my breath was still coming out in choked gasps.

*If I cross back to the other side, these things will probably stop hurting.*

I looked to the other side of the river, shaking uncontrollably from the pain in my forearms and the cold.

*Fuck that.*

I turned slowly, looking up the slope on this side of the river, and took a ragged breath before grasping the nearest tree and hauling myself up it. It was hard going, aside from the pain I felt, my hands were also useless. I had to hook the tree with my elbow, and couldn’t really grab for roots or branches to haul myself along. I managed to get up the slope though, and I forced myself forwards. I could barely stand up straight. Every so often I’d stumble, fall, and it would take me a minute or two to decided that, yes, I needed to get up. I tried to cast Light to help me see, between the thunderstorm and the late hour I could barely make out anything more than a few feet in front of me, but I just could not concentrate on the spell.

I fell, for probably the thousandth time. It was late, my watch said that it was 1:00AM, July-27, and I had no idea where I was. No idea where I was, only one more day of food, my glasses were gone which meant that compared to an elf I was basically blind, and with these cuffs on I could barely think. It was pitch black, I was wet, and there was no way I’d be able to sleep now that I’d triggered the cuffs. I had no idea where to find even a small village, and even if I did, could they even help me? Would they even help me? A giant, driven half mad by pain and covered in mud stumbles into town, I’d be lucky not to get stabbed to death with a pitch fork.

I looked down at the cuffs, how long had it been since I crossed the river? Hours at most, and already I was considering a solution to my problems that involved my belt and a stout tree branch. I turned my hands over, no joints or seams here either. I didn’t even know how these fit together. My rings caught my eye, the stupid fucking thumb rings. I’d made them for the bow, the bow that I’d lost when Enutur had tried to sell me. I’d made it to protect myself, spent fucking hours practicing with it, useless hours. Would it have helped with any of the shit I’d been though since losing it? It was useless, these stupid rings were useless, I tore off the stupid thumb rings and threw them into the night.

*All the planning in the fucking world, and it’s made useless because one pudgy asshole wants a payday.*

I stared at the aluminum ring, the one set with the mage stone. My mage stone.

*Why are you here Quinn? Why are you here, and not in Essens, cosy in bed with Sila. Why are you here, and not in Myra, cosy in bed with Thera. Why are you here, and not in Ventia, cosy in bed with Chypia? WHY ARE YOU HERE?*

The mage stone flared to life, blinding light illuminating the forest around me like a collapsed star. I stood up, and started walking.

-----

They found me the following night, just as the sun was going down. Apparently the mage stone had been burning that whole time, and it had made it easy to find me stumbling through the growing darkness.

# Chapter 23

Quinn

-----

I woke up somewhere strange and unknown, which was getting to be a habit of mine. The fact that I was without my glasses didn’t help with the strangeness either. There were a few things that demanded my immediate attention. Firstly, I was naked, which was not great. Secondly, I wasn’t restrained, which was better. Third, and this was the big one, I couldn’t feel the cuffs any more. I was in a narrow bed, which was far too short, and the sheets felt like sandpaper. In reality they were probably just the linens that were popular with common folk here in Elardia, but I’d gotten used to a rather different level of luxury when working for Chypia.

*Can’t be too common though if they got those damn cuffs off.*

I tried to sit up in bed, and had to force down a stab of panic when I realized that not only could I not feel the cuffs, I couldn’t feel my hands. I managed to push myself upright on my elbows, and I looked down at my hands. My hands were still there, along with my rings, and the cuffs were definitely gone. I brought my hands together, trying to see if I could feel anything in my hands, but it was like two chunks of wood knocking together. No feeling in my hands, none in my wrists, it wasn’t until I got to my elbows that I could start to feel anything. I still had some basic motor control, my hands weren’t flopping around uselessly on the ends of my arms, but beyond that a slight twitch in my fingers was about all I could manage.

“If there’s a goddess of luck, she can go fuck herself,” I said quietly.

I took a look around, trying to find my clothes and the rest of my things. I could see what looked like my oilskin bundle piled in the corner, my jacket and Adympian clothes were missing though. On the nightstand were my watch, and both of the gold cuffs.

There was a creak as the door opened, and an elf shaped blur entered the room. I couldn’t make out many details beyond the very broad strokes, but he seemed slight of build and had green hair. He was a little darker, and there were two blurry green splotches where his eyes should have been.

*A wood elf then, same general look as Moss.*

“You’re awake,” said the blur, in a man’s voice, “You even seem sane.”

“Oh I don’t know about that,” I said, with a little humour, “It’s still early yet.”

I lifted my useless hands, “I see you got the cuffs of, unfortunately…” I trailed off.

He took a seat in a chair near the bed, “You don’t have much feeling in your hands, do you?” He asked, with elves it was always hard to guess at an age, but if he was human I’d have guessed that he was in his fifties.

“I don’t have any feeling in my hands, none in my forearms either. Are you about to tell me that this is only temporary?” I asked, not daring to be hopeful.

He sighed, “I’m afraid not. I’ve tended to quite a few runaways from Adympia, I’ve never known any that have recovered from the damage that the manacles do.”

“Are you a Mage? Couldn’t you use some healing magic or something?”

“I am a Mage yes, I even know some healing magic, but this is not the sort of damage that can be healed. In fact, most of the time a very extensive healing will leave the healed portions much the same as your hands are now. Anything beyond skin and muscle is always a risk, anything more complicated than that usually gets put back together improperly. It’s usually enough to keep the patient alive, but it will often leave them crippled. Trying to heal your hands would likely only make it worse. I am sorry.”

*Nerve damage.*

“It’s not your fault,” I said, leaning back against the wall, “I’m guessing that eyes fall into the same category then?”

“Yes, healing magic almost always fails when used on the eyes. They’re simply too complicated,” he said, “Ah, why do you ask? There was that gash across your face, but your eyes seemed to have escaped injury.”

I raised a hand to my face, before I remembered how futile that would be, “My eyes aren’t injured, just defective. I’ve needed glasses since I was six years old, without them I’m mostly blind.”

He straightened a little, and if I could make out his expression I might have seen a look of concern on his face, “I’ve never known anyone to have such a problem, you say that ‘glasses’ could repair your vision though, what are those?”

“A wire frame used to hold two lenses in place. The lenses correct for the problem in my eyes, allowing me to see properly. And this can’t be solved with magic either I’m guessing?” I asked.

“Well, potentially anything is possible with magic, but I don’t know that any spells or enchantments exist for what you seem to need. You’d have to find a Mage or Wizard willing to do the work for you, and even then it might take years or decades for them to design a workable solution.”

“Dammit,” I said, clenching my fists in anger. Or, I tried to. My fingers just twitched impotently.

*So I’m down two of five senses, I wonder how I’ll lose the other three?*

“How hard is it for a Mage to get into the university at Nimre?” I asked.

“Hmm, not hard, wh- Oh yes. That ring holds a mage stone doesn’t it? That would explain the lights that the border patrol saw,” He said, I think he nodded towards my hand, it was hard to tell.

It flared to life with barely a second thought on my part, and he shaded his eyes, “Yes it is,” I said.

“My my, I don’t think you’ll have much trouble getting in at all,” he said, and I let the light fade, “It’s always hard to tell with just the mage stone, but you’re probably somewhere between the fifth and seventh levels of talent.”

“That’s good?” I asked. I’d guessed that the big bright lightshow was a good sign, but I hadn’t wanted to get my hopes up.

“Yes, as far as I know there’s only one person studying at the university now that is at the seventh level. Perhaps eight at the sixth level, and about fifty at the fifth level. Even as low as the second level the university tries its best to entice students to study there, they hand out substantial bursaries to people of your talent. Good students are worth quite a lot to the university,” he said, and I could just make out him glancing towards the cuffs on the nightstand.

I followed his gaze, “What is it?”

He sighed reluctantly, “Those manacles,” he hesitated, “They’re worth quite a lot to the university as well.”

*Fairly honest fellow.*

“How much money are we talking about here?” I asked.

“Those might be the first gold manacles that the university has ever had a chance to examine. They usually pay out ten thousand drachm just for the silver manacles, I have no idea how many they’d pay out for gold ones.”

*Holy fuck.*

A plan came to mind, a very good plan, “Tell you what. I want to get to Nimre, and I might need a little help with that,” I said, wiggling my arms, “If you help me get there, maybe introduce me to whoever it is admits new students, and you can have half the bounty.”

He perked up visibly at that, “I can certainly help with that, we can leave as soon as you’re feeling better.”

“I’m feeling better now,” I said, “I’ve spent the last two hundred days trying to get to Nimre, and it’s not been a pleasant two hundred days. I’m done waiting, I’m ready to go as soon as you are.”

He hopped up out of the chair, “I’ve got the clothes you were wearing downstairs drying by the fire-“

I shook my head, “Wearing Adympian clothes is another thing I’m done with, I’ve got my own clothes in that pack there,” I said, pointing to my bundle in the corner.

“I understand,” he said, and from his tone I didn’t doubt that for a second. He scooped up the bundle and held it out for me, “Um… Maybe my wife…”

*Right, dressing myself.*

“It’s fine,” I said, “I know Apportation, I’ll manage.”

He let out a relived breath, “Good, I’ll get my things together, I’ll be downstairs whenever you’re ready.”

He left me be, and I cast Apportation so I could dress myself. I started to do it with hand gestures, before stopping myself. I let out a long sigh, before casting it with a few words instead. I managed to dress without too much trouble, though Apportation’s manipulators were just as unfeeling as my hands were which made things somewhat difficult. I knew where they were, and what they were doing, but there was no feedback when I touched something.

-----

I left the small bedroom, shouldering my pack, and headed downstairs. His sitting room was rustic, but rather cosy. The walls were lined with overstuffed bookshelves, with more piled on tables and on a couple of the armchairs in the room. Judging from the light coming in through the windows it must have been early morning, and I could hear multiple someones bustling about in the next room.

“I can’t just let you two run off without having something to eat, your poor friend might not have had anything in days,” said a woman’s voice.

The healer, whose name I hadn’t thought to ask yet said, “It’s fine dear. We’ll teleport right over to Awan and we can eat there while I get ready for the jump to Nimre. There’s a nice café right near the beacon, the owner knows me, and they serve a very nice breakfast.”

*Teleportation,* ***and*** *food? That’s pretty cool.*

“Are you telling me that you’d rather have breakfast at a café than have me cook for you?” And I could imagine her threatening her husband with a rolling pin.

“Of course not,” he said, “But he’s very eager to be on his way, and I told you what he’s offered for me to help him get to the university.”

The wife sighed, “Fine, but you had better not be thinking of introducing him to Lili. I don’t want her anywhere near you.”

“Uhh…”

“Waenne! You can’t be serious!” said the woman, sounding upset.

“She’s on the admittance committee, and she loves meeting Outsiders. I’ll just introduce them, and be on my way, I promise,” he explained, a little desperately.

“Oh I think you know why she likes Outsiders so much,” she snapped.

“Cilla, there’s no need for that. I’ll be back tomorrow. Just there and back, I promise,” he said, and I heard a little smooch.

“Fine, but you’d better not come back smelling of her perfume,” she said, almost too quietly for me to hear.

“I promise Cilla, I’ll be back tomorrow.”

I turned to face one of the bookshelves, busying myself reading the titles, I did not want to be caught eavesdropping. They hadn’t been talking too loudly, but from what I could tell elven hearing wasn’t quite as good as human hearing. They might not have considered that they were speaking loud enough to be overheard.

“Ready to go?” Waenne asked.

I turned away from the bookshelves, “Yeah. By the way, I never got your name, I’m Quinn.”

“Ah, I’m Waenne,” he said, extending a hand.

I looked down at it, “Ah…”

“Sorry.”

“It’s fine.”

-----

We left his home, and I found that we were in a rather small village. I couldn’t make much out, but it had the same feeling as Essens or Letea. There were the same small cluster of houses, and the same dirt tracks leading between them. I followed as he lead the way towards the centre of town.

“Forgive me if it seems rude, but…” I started.

“Why would a Mage live here? When I could make twenty times as much working in the city? Any city?” He said, a little wryly.

“Ha, yeah, why do it?”

“My wife, Cilla. She was my sweetheart before I ever found out about my magic. This is where we grew up, and while I always wanted to see the big city, she always felt most comfortable here. I’d come back whenever I had a break to spend time with her, and when I finished my studies I decided to stay for good. I’ve certainly made my mistakes, hurt her when I didn’t mean to, but I’m happy here and she’s forgiven me,” he explained, a little hesitantly, “Besides,” he said, perking up a little, “There’s still good work to be done here. I’ve got most of the villages along the border linked with beacons, and I’ve gotten fairly good at dealing with those manacles. Someone needs to do it, it might as well be me.”

*Cilla, Sila. Is the universe trying to tell me something?*

“Well I certainly appreciate it. What about those beacons, what are those?” I asked.

“Ah, teleport beacons. You’ll learn more about this at the university, but a Teleport beyond more than five hundred or so yards is very difficult. Ten miles is the reasonable limit for most people, and even then it’s very difficult to do it accurately. If you want to teleport over long distances you need a pair of beacons, one at each end. We’re going to jump from the one here in town, to the one in Awan, then from Awan to Nimre.”

“Awan being the capital of Ashur?” I asked, and he nodded in reply. “How long ago did you set the beacons up, why weren’t there beacons already? It seems like if you had enough mages running around the country then most everywhere would already be linked together.”

“Maybe a decade ago, and depending on how you look at it everywhere is already linked together. Trouble is that most Mages, having gone to the trouble of making all their beacons, don’t share them with other Mages. Even small towns like this will have as many as a dozen beacons, but they’re nearly always enchanted so that only the Mage who created them and their friends can use them. Mine are public though, I haven’t set any limiting enchantments to prevent their use.”

*Note to self, set up massive network of beacons and charge for their use.*

“What about the ones between Awan and Nimre? Did you make those as well?”

“No, those ones are public. Most major cities are linked by public beacons, it’s the towns and villages that miss out,” he explained.

“So we’re going to be in Nimre in, what, ten minutes?” I asked.

“No, I’ll need to rest before making the jump to Nimre. We’ll have breakfast at a nice café that caters to just our sort of traveler while I recover my mana,” he said.

*Mana, right.*

My question would have to wait though, because we got to the town square where a small stone obelisk sat. It was maybe 3 feet tall, tapered at the top, and a foot across.

“Here we are, now just give me a moment,” Waenne said.

-----

Teleportation wasn’t nearly as interesting an experience as I thought it would be. One moment Waenne was gesticulating and chanting while I kept a hand on his shoulder, and the next we were in the middle of a city square. It might have been more interesting if my vision was better, but as it was the brown soft ground turned into grey hard ground, and the small buildings got a bit bigger and moved around, but that was it. I felt a slight passing nausea, but it faded almost as soon as it was noticed.

“You alright Quinn? The first teleport can make you awfully queasy,” He said, and from the looks of things it seemed like he was waiting to see if he was going to need to catch me or get out of the line of fire.

“I’m fine,” I said, “You said there’s a café somewhere nearby? I think the last time I’ve eaten was noon two days ago.”

“Two days? You should have mentioned something Quinn, you must be famished,” he said, seeming concerned.

“I’m fine,” I repeated.

“Well you weren’t jesting when you said your vision was bad, the café’s right here Quinn,” he said, nodding just to one side where I could see a blurry patio area, and an even blurrier building. We weren’t ten feet from the nearest table.

We found somewhere to sit, and I asked my burning question, “You mentioned that you needed to recover your mana, I don’t know if this is an impolite question to ask a Mage, but how much mana do you have? Or rather, how much mana do most Mages have?”

“Don’t worry, it’s not too impolite. You’ll get asked that question plenty by your instructors. I’ve got about twelve, depends on how much I’ve been exercising my magic. Most mages have about ten,” he explained.

*So I’m a physical cripple, as well as a magical cripple.*

“Have you worked out how much mana you have?” He asked.

“Yeah, one,” I said, not at all bitterly.

He was about to respond, but that was when our waiter shaped blur arrived to take our order. I ordered a truly ludicrous amount of food, and Waenne continued.

“One mana, are you sure?” He asked sceptically.

“Yeah, I did some tests with Apportation. Without this ring,” I said, nodding towards the mana stone ring, ”I can lift ten pounds. With the ring, I can lift twenty or thirty pounds, depending on whether I use a one or two point stone. That’s consistent with my other spells too, I can get candle light out of Light, but not torch light, unless I use one of the one point stones. I can cast the one point version of any of the spells I know, but can’t go beyond that without the ring.”

“That,” he started, sounding confused. I was sure he was also wearing a confused expression, but of course… “Doesn’t make any sense.”

I raised my hands, “I certainly don’t know how this works, you’re the Mage. You tell me.”

“Hmm. When you cast a spell how do you do it?” He asked, trying to put things together.

“Well I used to cast just with hand gesutures, though that’s not really an option any more. Now I do it with the incantation,” I explained, and I cast the spell to demonstrate.

And also so I could feed myself.

Waenne leaned back, taking a sip of his tea, “Sounds a lot like you don’t have any mana at all. Actually, ah, I hope I’m not brining up any bad memories, but what sort of, ah, slave, were you in Adympia?”

“I was a steward, and you said I might not have any mana? What do you mean?”

“Well. You managed to keep your magic secret then?” He asked.

“Yeah, not that I had to try too hard. Some guard waved a stick at me, and said I wasn’t a Mage,” I said.

“Well, the Adympians test to see if someone is a Mage by checking to see whether they have mana or not. Only Wizards and Mages have mana, and while it’s not as precise as what they’ll do at the university to see what level of ability you have, it works. So if they checked you, and the result came up negative, then you probably don’t have any mana,” he said, as if that explained everything.

“That,” I started, “Doesn’t make any sense. I can cast spells, I just cast a spell,” I said, waving around a scone with my manipulator.

“Well sure, but you cast it with just the one or two words. Between that and your fairly high talent, I’m pretty sure you know the spell well enough to not need any mana to cast it. At least if you’re not trying to do too much with the spell.”

“Ah,” I began, *I don’t understand at all,* “Can you elaborate?”

“Alright,” he said, setting aside his finished meal, and gesturing with a fork, “Any spell you cast requires mana. The thing is, you don’t provide all of that mana. It depends on the spell, but most of the time you only provide a tiny amount to get the spell started, then the spell feeds on the ambient mana that surrounds all of us. You might need to chip in a little more every minute or so, but you’re not feeding most of the energy into the spell yourself. The thing is, if you’re skilled enough you might be able to give the spell a little push without spending any of your own mana at all. That’s why you can cast Apportation or Light. Of course, if you want a bigger effect, you need to provide a bigger push. That’s why you can’t get more out of either of the spells.”

“What about the incantations and the gestures then, is that related to the ‘push’ in any way,” I asked, this was starting to make sense. I didn’t have an infinite mana recovery rate after all.

“Ah, not really. In theory any Mage could cast any spell without anything more than a thought. The words or the gestures aren’t actually required, they serve more as a memory aid when you’re trying to form the spell. The fact that you can already cast spells with the bare minimum of incantations is a pretty good sign though. Even talent alone wouldn’t account for that, you’d need to be fairly bright as well.”

I smiled, “Why thank you. What about casting spells with a thought then, how hard is that? And is there any reason to do the gestures and incantations if you can cast it with only a thought?”

“It’s fairly hard. Even very skilled Mages can usually only cast a few spells with nothing but a thought. You need to know the spell very, very well. Most of the time it’ll be something that could be used to get yourself out of a bind. Personally the only spell I know well enough to cast with a thought is Reshape. It’s not an easy one by any means, but it lets the caster mould stone or metal like clay. It’s a little insurance against capture. As for the gestures,” he said, waving a hand, “Well, if you want to be really particular, no, they’re not necessary. It can guard against mishaps though, sometimes you haven’t got the spell quite straight in your head, and doing the dance and singing the song can help smooth over any bumps. I usually only bother doing that when I’m teleporting. I don’t want to end up in the wrong city after all.”

“So. What am I supposed to do then? I kinda feel like having no mana is a pretty major hindrance when it comes to this whole ‘magic’ thing.”

He laughed, “Sorry, it’s just funny when you put it like that,” he said, trying to stifle the laughter, “Well you can exercise your magic, just like you exercise your body. Do it enough and you might be able to eke out a small increase. Probably not more than four or five more mana though. You might want to invest heavily in mana stones once you get to the university. You’re already off to a decent start after all,” he finished, gesturing at the ring in question.

“How fast do these regenerate anyway? I’d guessed about one point per day, but I’m not sure.”

“Yeah, about one per day. If you’re in an area with higher than normal mana it’ll be faster, but not by a whole lot.”

“What about a Mages own mana?”

“Depends on the Mage. That’s another thing you can train to get better at, but usually it takes about ten minutes.”

“Damn, so even with a pocket full of mana stones I’m still going to have a pretty big handicap then,” I sighed.

“I’m afraid so,” he said.

“And the bigger stones are even more expensive aren’t they?”

“Yup.”

“Dammit.”

“Ha! Yup.”

I sighed.

I finished eating my pile of food, and Waenne paid, and we took our places by the obelisk to make the jump to Nimre.

-----



-----

The jump to Nimre was much like the jump to Awan, sudden change in the splotchy scenery, slight nausea, and we were there. Waenne seemed to need a moment though, holding his stomach and putting a hand on the obelisk to steady himself.

“You alright?” I asked. He seemed a little green, and I wasn’t just talking about his hair.

“Oh I’m fine,” he said, straightening and taking deep breaths, “I’m just surprised you’re taking it so well. I remember the first time my instructor had my team all try a teleport. Bastard did it right after taking us out for a nice big lunch, I don’t think any of us managed to keep our food down. And you just tucked away enough food to feed a small army.”

“Well that might be one upside to being mostly blind. All the teleport really does for me is change the general colour scheme of all the different coloured blurry patches I can see,” I said, trying to find something positive about my situation.

“That bad then?” He asked, sympathetically.

“Yeah. My glasses would correct my vision to about human normal. Even with those though I’m fairly sure my vision was much less acute than an elf’s. Without them?” I held my hand about a foot from my face, “About here is where I can start to make out detail. Further than that, and it’s all one big mess.”

We were quiet for a little as we walked towards where Waenne had said the university was, and then he asked a really annoying question.

“Why do you want to learn magic Quinn?”

“Does it matter?” I asked, and I had to stop myself from being too flippant. He had saved me from pain induced insanity after all.

“Yes Quinn, it does. You’ll want to have a good answer. It’s one of the things you’ll be asked before you’re admitted. It’ll be easier since you talent seems to be pretty high, but you still need a good answer. So, why do you want to learn magic?”

I took a breath, “I don’t know. It’s certainly better than staying where I landed when I was dropped off by the Banestorm. It’s a better opportunity, it will let me see and do more. Well, do more at least.”

“Quinn… Have you ever considered that magic might not be right for you?”

“What?” I said sharply, “Why wouldn’t it be right for me?”

“Well, where were you a couple of hours ago?” He asked.

“In your house? In bed I guess,” I was not sure where this was going.

“And you’d just escaped slavery, and then endured a day of torture from those manacles, right?”

“Yes?”

“And then, you leap out of bed, not stopping to rest, and insist that we go to Nimre immediately.”

“Yeah, I’m sorry if I was kind of demanding, but I’ve been trying to get here since almost the first week I’ve been on Elardia,” I said.

“That's not what I'm talking about, Quinn. It’s like I said, magic takes passion, and this is something your instructors might challenge you on. After all you’ve been though, I don’t know what you had to do in Adympia, or what you had to do to escape, but it can’t have been pleasant. Then you follow that with a day of constant torture, Quinn, most people that we don’t find in the first few hours are dead. Not from the manacles, but at their own hands, you endured a full day of that. Then you’re perfectly fine the next morning? I want to know, and your instructors will want to know what's driving you. Why are you enduring all that hardship? You seem almost not to care. When you were eating for example, did you even enjoy it?”

“What-” I sighed, “What does it even matter if I enjoyed it or not? I was hungry, it’s like you said, I was famished. So I ate.”

“Quinn,” then **he** sighed. There was a lot of sighing happening, “How about an easier question. What makes you happy?”

*Fuck.*

It took me more time that I’d like to admit for me to come up with a solution, “Games I guess. The games here aren’t quite as complex or varied as they were back home,” *I miss my computer,* “But Zatrikion, dice, cards, they’re fun I guess.”

“You guess?” He prodded.

“I don’t know man. Magic makes me happy I suppose,” I said resignedly.

*That might* ***be*** *my answer in fact.*

“Magic and games then?” He asked, “That’s it?”

*Do I explain myself to this guy? Why the hell not.*

I took a quick peek around, I didn’t want anyone too close to overhear. I did not like sharing things about myself.

“I’m very intelligent Waenne, and I don’t just mean that I’m a bit more clever than the average person. I’m smart enough, that I can learn pretty much any skill, pick up any hobby, anything. I’ve been to a university already, one back home. And I’ve been in a lot of school before that. On Earth humans are in school usually from the time they’re five years old, to the time they’re twenty. That might not sound like much for an elf, but a human usually only lives to be about eighty. I’ve never had to try. Never. I barely studied, and I’d still come out of it near the top of my class. The only kids that would keep ahead of me were the ones that would go home every night and study for hours. Any skill, any subject, I could pick up and learn faster than anyone. Hell, most of the time when I guess the answer to something, I find out that I was dead on. But I never mastered anything. I never was at the **top** of my class, I was never the **best** at anything. I could be really very good, with barely any effort, but I was always too lazy to be more than that. I just never cared enough. Why bother? I wasn’t like I was settling for average either, I was good, and people knew it.”

I paused, finding myself short of breath. Waenne’s eyes had been locked on me since I’d started speaking.

“It did not earn me a lot of friends. I’d like to say that it was jealousy, and maybe it was. Mostly it was arrogance though. I’d show up with an eleven page term paper written in a couple of hours and get an A. Someone else would get an A+, but for them the paper represented a month of late nights in the library.”

I was getting a little off track, I had a point to make after all.

“The point is, I’ve never needed to try to be good at anything. Except for games. That was the one thing where I could find a decent challenge, a reason to try harder. Every game had new rules, new nuances to just how it was played. I had to try. I’d start good, very good, but with games at least I wasn’t willing to settle for that. I don’t know how to begin to explain what the internet is, but it’s enough to say that if I wanted to find the absolute best players in the world at any given game, I could. Now that option is taken from me. I can sit down at a table in any given tavern, and pick up whatever game they’re playing, and win. Hell, when it comes to cards, it’s more of an effort for me to not win too much. But magic? I want magic. I **want** it. You said that I lack passion? Magic might be the only thing in the world that I’m passionate about.”

I looked him right in the eye, or at least, I looked right where I thought his eye was, “How’s that for an answer?”

“You’re wound up pretty tight aren’t you Quinn?” he said, humour in his voice.

I choked out a laugh, “Yeah. Yeah I am.”

“Well I think that answer will do just fine,” he said, seeming satisfied.

“Um, I don’t suppose that you’re secretly one of the people in charge of finding new mages, and that this has all been a test?” Come on, genre savvyness has to help a little here.

“That’s a good guess,” he said brightly, “but no. I did teach at the university for a little while, but only ever to Wizards. I stay at home with Cilla now.”

“Damn. Oh, does that mean that I’m going to need to repeat that whole speech to whoever you introduce me to then?”

“Yup!”

“Dammit.”

“Maybe tone it down a little though, in fact, maybe just skip to the end there. ‘Magic might be the only thing in the world that I’m passionate about’ is a really good line. The rest of the stuff just makes you sound like an arrogant prick.”

*Well…*
