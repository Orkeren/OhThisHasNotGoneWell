# Authors Note

This is a story I’ve had in my head for a while now, and this seems as good a place as any to get it out. I don’t know that it’s going to make a very good story, but I guess we’ll see how things go.

My main inspiration comes from tabletop games, video games, and books where magic plays some role. That might be games where you can play a spellcaster, or books where there are magic using characters, but I always find myself coming around to the same thought. What would happen if someone took the magic system present in the game or book, and applied a modern understanding of science to get the most out of their magical studies?

Now this has been done to some extent with “. This is not meant to be the same thing redone by a much worse writer. While HPMR showed the results of the “methods of rationality” applied to a magical world, it didn’t really focus on Harry trying to create new spells or magical items using his scientific knowledge. It’s this item and spell creation that I want to experiment with. I want to see what happens when knowledge of science, particularly chemistry and physics, are applied specifically to the **use** of magic.

It’s all well and good to say “The wizard throws a fireball” and get a big boom, but what if a clever individual with a decent memory of high school chemistry designs their own fireball with  explosives, which pound for pound will beat anything short of a nuke for destructive power.

For most spells and magic items I come across in any medium, game or book, I think up these “what ifs”. This story is my way of trying to get them out of my head and work them out.

The Mythbusters used tools and materials in ways for which they were never intended, this is meant to be spells and enchantments used in ways for which they were never intended. Except for this first bit. The guy needs to actually find someone to teach him magic after all. Probably many someones, I do like the idea of a magical school.

Critique is certainly welcome, I’m doing this mostly to clear my own thoughts but I also want to put out something that at least resembles a good story.



# Prologue / Chapter 1

Quinn was driving down the highway on his way back to Toronto, having spent the day hiking in Algonquin Park with some friends. He did his best to stretch in the driver’s seat of the small hatchback, muscles sore from the lengthy hike and then the past two hours spent sedentary in the car. It wasn’t terribly busy on the road, but the thunder storm that had convinced Quinn and his friends from U of T to head back to civilization hadn’t yet passed and was getting worse.

He could see some people had pulled off to the side of the road, hazard lights on, to try to wait out the worst of the storm. Quinn continued, trusting in the venerable Subaru’s four wheel drive and keeping a safe distance behind the vehicle ahead, rather than risk trying to pull over on the highway with semis speeding past. The storm was a rather large one, and he was rather interested in what seemed almost like a green tint to the flashes of lighting.

*Near a factory maybe? Though I feel like spewing enough stuff into the air to make the sky change colour should probably be illegal.*

The sky continued to gain this green tint; first it was only noticeable when the dark sky was lit up with a flash of lightning. Now it was becoming obvious despite the late hour and the storm blocking any light from the moon. Some of the other vehicles had started to slow down or speed up a little as people started rubbernecking and paid less attention to the road and the cars around.

Quinn focused on the road, rather than gawk at the odd storm, as he neared an overpass that curved gently. He didn’t really want to get into an accident if some old guy in a Volvo wasn’t paying attention and had to swerve or brake suddenly to keep from bumping into the guard rail. As it turned out, octogenarian drivers were not the cause of Quinn’s crash.

He had just reached the apex of the bridge when visibility suddenly dropped to zero. His heart rate spiked, it had seemed as if the fog had just boiled up around him. He became suddenly aware of just how fast he was going, on an overpass, a story or two above ground, with at least half a dozen other vehicles that were similarly blind. Quinn spent about a second considering what to do, did he maintain speed so as not to get rear-ended by someone behind who didn’t slow down, or did he stop to avoid running into someone that decided to stop. His thoughts were interrupted by a much worse problem, however, as he felt the car lurch and the bottom dropped out of his stomach.

*Oh this has* ***not*** *gone well.*

-----------------------

Quinn stamped on the brake pedal, for all the good it would do, hoping he’d hit the ground before he’d hit a… TREE! There was a white flash as Quinn lurched forwards against the seatbelt and the airbags went off in his face. Though the haze and disorientation of having just been in a high speed car accident he felt the rear of the car fall backwards, dragging him towards the earth. There was another sickening moment of weightlessness before his head slammed against the headrest as the rear end of car hit the ground.

*Please land on the wheels, please land on the wheels, please land on the- shit.*

Briefly vertical, the car fell backwards onto its roof and Quinn felt it start to slide down a slope as he finally lost consciousness.




# Chapter 2

I came to, which was a relief. It was also really painful, I felt like I had spent an hour in a tumble dryer. What had been essentially three consecutive car accidents, the first at highway speed, had taken a toll. I just laid there wheezing, chest hurting with every breath and my head hurting so much that it was hard not just to think but to see. I tried to find the door handle with my left hand, pushing myself up with my right. My arms felt stiff, numb, and hurt like hell. My hand bumped into something and I heard it shatter. That would be the window, aim lower Quinn. As I fumbled around trying to find the damned door handle, I started to feel very nauseous. I was doing my best not to panic but between the near-blindness, difficulty of breathing, and the massive headache I was getting more and more frantic when I felt someone touch my shoulder and gently press me back down.

“Shhh, shhhhh, you’re alright, you’re alright” soothed the young woman’s voice, in the same tone of voice one might use to calm a wild animal.

Ah right, hospital. I laid back down, stumbling around half blind after repeated head trauma probably wasn’t the best idea. Hopefully my neck wasn’t broken, though I couldn’t feel one of those immobilizing braces on my neck. I did my best to relax, and not throw up on myself or the nurse. I heard the nurse saying something else meant to be soothing when I passed out again.

I must have been out for a while, because when I woke again I could see sunlight streaming in through a window next to my bed. I found this somewhat disconcerting, since what I could see in the sunlight was not really what I was expecting from a hospital room. Rather than a room smelling faintly of antiseptic with off-white walls and a rather clinical approach to interior decorating, I found a room best described as ‘rustic’.

My vision was still rather blurry, and I twisted around in the bed trying to see if my glasses were sitting on one of the side tables. No such luck. I did see my watch and phone, but apparently whoever had pulled me out of the car hadn’t also gotten my glasses. I closed my eyes and relaxed into the bed, just trying to look around had made my head throb and my vision swim.

*Where the hell am I and why is where I am not a hospital? I do appreciate not being in the car anymore, but if I’ve gotten kidnaped by a crazy woman with a whole Florence Nightingale thing going on I’m going to be pissed. Alright, step 1, figure out where I am. Step 2, get to a hospital.*

I did my best to get a look around despite being without my glasses. The bed itself had a couple different blankets on it, both rough wool of the sort that someone’s grandma might make. Though it lacked in colour, these blanket were all shades of grey and brown. The sheets were made of rough linen, and is this mattress stuffed with straw? The bed was also surprisingly short, and was lying sort of diagonally across it with my knees bent to actually fit on the thing.

*Did I crash into the Upper Canada Village?*

The walls themselves were wood paneled and there was some rustic looking furniture in the room. The bed, a pair of side tables, a small desk with a simple chair, and a small dresser. It looked like rough timber, sanded down and stained a dark brown. It was simple furniture, but it had been made by someone that seemed to have some general idea of what they were doing. The corners were square and the surfaces were approximately level. It wouldn’t have looked out of place in an Elder Scrolls game. The floor was more sanded and stained timber, probably a good idea to walk around with shoes on though I don’t want any splinters in my feet.

There was a creak from the hallway, a light knock on the door, and a rather tall man stepped half into the room. It was hard to make out details without my glasses, but he seemed to have sharpish features and he seemed to have rather large eyes. His brown hair was pulled back into a short tail and just brushed the top of the doorway as he stepped in.

“Ah, you’re awake. I feared for sure that you’d be dead after I’d seen your carriage” said the tall man in a voice that made it sound like he was trying to talk around a mouthful of dirt.

I sat up in bed, which caused my head to throb again, and I realized for the first time that I was wearing only my boxers.

“I feel like I’m most of the way to being dead, where am I?”

“This is Essens, the nearest chapel is another town over so we brought you here to my tavern instead,” the man explained “You gave my daughter quite the fright, and she came running back shouting about a monster”

“I’m sorry about that, I thought I was still in the car and was trying to find the door handle. I must have knocked something off the end table and broke it.”

“Oh no, that’s not what I meant,” he replied “And it’s no trouble, we have plenty of mugs. No, Sila heard you crash last evening when she was heading back from mushroom picking. She ran back to us as we were just finishing up the harvest, she said she heard an ogre smashing through the forest. We found your carriage upside down in the brook, it looked all mashed up and there were bits of glass everywhere.”

“Last evening?” *Ogre? What?* “I hope you didn’t have to carry me far” *I’m either the subject of a really messed up prank or really far from home. I need to see the crash site.*

“Aye it’s about noon now, and the carriage was only about a mile-on up the hill,” he said “and yer quite a lot lighter than you look”

*Alright, as soon as I can stand up without passing out I need to get to the car. If this is a prank then I should be able to find something off about the scene. And if not… well I guess life just got much more interesting. Either way I want my stuff from the trunk, assuming it’s not all smashed to bits.*

“I’m Harpatro by the way,” he said while extending a hand “everybody just calls me Harp.”

I took the offered hand and shook it. The man’s hands were much smaller than I’d expected for someone of his size, and they were also somewhat cold despite the warm breeze blowing in through the window.

“Quinn,” I replied “And I appreciate the help”

At this point a young woman stepped into the room carrying a tray with a bowl of what smelled a lot like soup on it. At least she looked like a young woman, I had a hard time picking out her nose or eyes from the rest of her face even at this distance. She was only about half a head shorter than Harp.

“Here you are,” she said as she laid the tray on my lap. ”I thought you’d be hungry.” She seemed to have the same problem Harp did with actually pronouncing the words, but it was somewhat less noticeable with her.

I recognized the voice as the one that I had heard the previous… night? Either way, she was the same girl from earlier.

“Ah, this is Sila” Harp explained.

“Thank you Sila, for the food and for letting someone know where I was. And my name is Quinn by the way”

“You’re welcome,” she said in a quiet voice, brushing back her long brown hair “It was really no trouble.”

“Well you just relax Quinn, eat up and take your time resting,” said Harp in a gentle voice.

“Uhhh… shouldn’t I be paying you? It’s not fair to burden your family to take care of a stranger. If I can find my wallet I have some--”

“No no no,” he interrupted. “It’s no trouble, no trouble at all. We just brought in the harvest and it’s been a good year. You worry about getting better, if you really want to help out it can wait until you’re feeling better.”

“Um, is there anything you want me to bring you?” Sila asked in a near whisper

“I was wondering where the rest of the stuff I had on me was,” I said looking over at my phone and watch which were sitting on the side table. “And maybe a book or something? If it’s not too much trouble.”

“A book?” It was impossible to read her facial expression without my glasses, but from her voice she sounded somewhat surprised. She looked up at Harp, who I guessed was her father.

*I guess in this fictional medieval village no one can read.*

“Oh Pell keeps a few books on the shelf downstairs, why don’t you fetch a couple for him Sila. And the rest of your things are just under the table there,” he said, pointing under the side table to my left.

*One guy can read, Pell, he’s the designated smart guy.*

I thanked him and he left the room, his daughter scurrying after him, door remaining slightly ajar. I leaned down, which caused my head to throb in protest, and picked up my jeans and jacket from under the table. My shoes, shirt, and socks were all there as well. They’d been cleaned, no mud from my previous hike in the park or unintentional bath in a brook. I went through the pockets of my jeans and found my wallet, and got my tiny Swiss Army knife out of the pocket of my jacket. It was the one that had come with my watch so it contained only a knife, file, scissors, and tweezers. I had long since lost the toothpick.

I ate while digging though my wallet. It was a delicious vegetable stew, and my stomach growled audibly when I got the first proper whiff of the stuff. In the wallet there was 85$ in bills, nine something in change, and a bunch of cards. Library card, student ID, OHIP card, debit card, and driver’s licence. Also had a slim 16GB flash drive, and a bunch of business cards and buy 9 get 1 free cards for different stores. So I hadn’t been robbed, and I couldn’t feel any new scars on my lower back so they hadn’t helped themselves to a kidney.

*Seems like a lot of trouble to go through to prank someone. I really fucking hope this is a prank.*

I put everything back into my wallet and dropped it onto the side table and picked up my watch. It was a nice watch, Swiss Military, all titanium construction. It reported that it was currently 12:15 on Apr-10 and generally seemed to be in good shape.

*April 10th, that matches what they said. Yesterday was the 9th, though didn’t Harp say that they’d just brought in the harvest? I’m pretty sure that most crops get harvested in fall. Alright, moment of truth.*

I reached over and picked up my phone, and while the screen had apparently been cracked in the crash it still had 68% battery remaining.

“I’m sorry”

I looked up startled, to see Sila standing in the doorway with a couple of books.

“I shouldn’t have been going through your things, I’m sorry, and when that thing lit up it startled me and I dropped it. Did I break it?” she said almost too quickly to follow, in her demure half-whisper.

“Ah…,” I sighed “It’s okay, the screen is cracked but it looks like it still works, what have you got there?” I said, changing the subject.

“These are the books you wanted,” she said lamely.

*I can see that*

“I don’t know what they’re about but these are the ones I sometimes see Pell reading when he’s here”

*Right, she’s supposedly illiterate.*

“Thank’s,” I said as I took the books from her, reading the titles

“Um, what are they about?” she asked.

“This one,” I said, indicating the smaller of the two books “is titled ‘The Triumph of Tigoro’”

“I know that one, sometimes Moss tells the story on feast day” she said excitedly.

I nodded, and hefted the larger book “This one is titled ‘Local Elardian History’ which I’m guessing is a history book”

*A clever writer could throw together a convincing ancient legend. But putting together the history of a whole… city? Country? Continent? Would be a lot harder to do convincingly. Though this book was volunteered to me, so it might be a clever double bluff. Hand me a seeming consistent history of a fictional… whatever it was about, and let me convince myself that no one could fake this. Though why the hell bother? I’m a computer science student from Toronto. Someone with a lot of money must be very bored.*

“Oh, do you want me to get you a different one? That one sounds kinda boring,” she said, head bowed slightly.

“No, it’s fine. I’m interested in history anyway,” I replied.

“Oh of course, sorry, I should have realized,” she said quietly, turning a little pink.

I realized at this point that I was sitting in a bed, most of the way to being naked, in front of the girl. *I guess she’s trying to play the innocent village girl, and so she’s not supposed to be the sort of person that spends much time alone with half naked men in quiet bedrooms.* I reached down to where the rest of my clothes lay and pulled on my shirt. This seemed to settle her slightly, and she left after taking away the dinner tray.

Once she left I checked my phone. No messages, no missed calls, and no signal. No 4G, zero bars, no Wi-Fi hotspots nearby. And it was my phone, I had a utility on it that would let it boot into a second hidden OS. Even if someone had been looking for it they’d not be able to find it easily, and since you needed an encryption key to get into it they couldn’t simply make a copy with the same hidden OS. If they had done it my code wouldn’t have worked to unlock the hidden portion. This was my phone, and it hadn’t been tampered with. I could tell as much from the diagnostic tools I had hidden in my secret partition. No panicked texts or calls from anyone that should have been expecting me home, and no records of deletion. Technically nothing is hack-proof, but you can only take suspicion so far before you start to doubt your own sanity.

It didn’t look like anyone was using a phone jammer either, my tools should have picked that up. One trouble with jamming is that it’s ‘active’. In layman’s terms the jammer needs to be shouting louder than the nearest cell tower. This means that the phone is picking something up, it’s just not a very useful something. A normal phone would just register no signal and the battery would drain as it tried to get the cell tower back. My phone however is special, mostly because I like having gadgets and you can cram a surprising number of tools onto a rooted Android. I would have been able to tell if someone was jamming the phone.

I turned it off. It wouldn’t do any good anyway without a network connection. I resolved to check it occasionally to see if I’d gotten any messages and to see if I could get any signal, but for now it was an expensive brick.

-----------

It was a few days before I could really walk much further than the bathroom, which surprisingly was not just a hole in the ground. There was a sort of proto-toilet looking thing in an actual washroom, which was nice since chamber pots seemed a little undignified. It only took a few days for me to read every book in the whole village, which sounds impressive until you discover that there were only 5, and had come to some worrying conclusions.

I was still hesitant to accept anything I saw as given, I was ready for someone to jump out of the bushes with a camera shouting “PUNKD” with all the actors falling over themselves laughing about how I seemed convinced that I’d traveled back in time, but I was getting concerned. The Elardian History book seemed pretty realistic. Now I’m studying Computer Science at U of T, and not history, but I have taken several History courses. They take up the bulk of my electives, and it wouldn’t be too much work to graduate with History as a second major. Expecting the history book to be a fabrication, I had thought it would be the work of a few writers brainstorming something that would make an interesting history for a fantasy novel. Instead I got what looked and felt like an actual history book. It didn’t help that it seemed to be somewhat corroborated by ‘The Triumph of Tigoro’ and the rest of the books, all of which recounted local legends. Tigoro was mentioned in the history book as a great general, like Leonidas except with less kicking Persian dudes into pits and more sneaky Trojan horse type stuff. ‘The Triumph’ was essentially the same story, but told as a heroic epic, rather than as a summary of events and important dates. It was a similar situation with the other books I had read during those few days. They were either a heroic take on specific characters, or more kid friendly stories that seemed to have enough behind them to place them properly in the history I had read.

*I really need to get back to my car.*

------


I had reset the date function on my watch, I left the time as-is, but the morning I woke up after the crash would be Jan-01 and it works a hell of a lot better than making tally marks on the wall. Besides, I didn’t really want to upset Harp my gouging up his walls if this turns out not to be a big joke.

The watch read ‘Jan-04’ when Sila suggested we have supper downstairs instead of in my room. I’d gotten a little bored after finishing all the books and my head was feeling marginally better so I agreed to go make the arduous journey down the stairs.

I stood up, careful not to hit my head on the ceiling like I had the first couple times I’d gotten up to relieve myself. My initial assessment of Harp and Sila had been that they were near my height. With my vision still blurry without glasses, all I could see was that Harp brushed the top of the doorway. From this I guessed that he was a couple inches taller than me, putting him at 6’ 8” or 6’ 9”. Sila was about half a head shorter than Harp so I figured somewhere in the 6’ 2” to 6’ 4” range. I was wrong. By a lot.

The ceiling was only 6ft from the floor, which meant I couldn’t stand up straight. The doorway was only a little more than 5ft high which put Harp, apparently a ‘tall’ man, at 5’ 4” at most.

*It* ***is*** *like Upper Canada Village, I remember going there in elementary school. Even then I was tall enough that I’d needed to duck under doorways. This place seems built on the same scale.*

Sila herself only came up to a little above my elbow, and the height difference had surprised her the first time I had gotten out of bed. It had also added somewhat to her shyness, but she had been getting over it once we got to know each other better. She’d come up to talk to me occasionally over the past couple days, or she’d eat in with me when she took me my meal so we’d had time to talk. She told me about what the village was like, and asked plenty of questions about me that I couldn’t really decide how to answer. I was still trying to figure out whether this was all an elaborate scheme, or that I really did travel to some other world.

We entered the common room and she led me over to a table where Harp was sitting with two men I hadn’t met yet. One man seemed to have green hair, Moss I’m guessing? The other had the same brown hair that Sila and Harp shared, and seemed like the beefiest guy at the table. Harp and Moss, assuming it was Moss, both were pretty fit and had the sort of muscle tone you get if you work with your hands for a living. The third guy however looked like he could bench about 250lbs without a whole lot of trouble. I’m guessing blacksmith? Probably-Moss and Probably-Blacksmith were playing what I was sure had to be chess. Probably-Moss looked up from the game as we approached, and his eyes got rather wide when he saw me. At this reaction the other two turned to look over at Sila and I approach.

“Quinn was feeling a little better so I thought that it would be good to eat down here for a change” Sila explained to those at the table.

“Please, sit,” said Harp, pushing out the chair across from him with his foot “I knew you weren’t quite a small man, but you gotta have giant’s blood in you to be so tall. Pell, Moss, this is Quinn”

“Hello, it’s nice to meet the two of you,” I said, shaking hands with the two men “I believe I’ve been borrowing some of your books Pell.”

“Ah, someone else who appreciates them, which ones have you been reading?” Pell asked, in what sounded like a fairly normal voice.

*No dirt chewing for Pell, he’s definitely designated smart guy.*

“All of them’,” I replied, “I finished the last one this morning, I haven’t really had anything to do except sit and read.”

Pell raised his eyebrows, or at least, I think he did. I was really hoping my glasses would be in the car and not smashed to pieces. “You are quite the quick reader, though I guess it only makes sense.”

“Makes sense?” I asked, raising my own eyebrows.

“Well you must either be a Lord or a great Mage, it’s only sensible,” Explained Pell, in a tone of voice that seemed to indicate that he believed that what he’d said must be the absolute truth. “So, which is it?”

“Uh,” I hesitated, “Why would you say that?” I said slowly.

“Well you speak with more confidence and clarity than even the Baron,” he said, “and you apparently have a carriage made of tin and glass. I’m not even sure what the wheels are made of, they can only be the creation of a Mage. Your hands look like they’ve never seen a day of work. So either you are yourself a Mage, or you’re a Lord who’s paid a Mage to create such a splendid carriage for him.”

*Mage? This guy believes in magic? He’s definitely right about the hands thing though.*

“I’m afraid I’m neither of those things Pell, I am educated, but I’m no Lord and no Mage,” I explained. *What the hell am I supposed to tell these guys? To hell with it, let’s try the truth.* “I’m afraid what I really am, is lost. I don’t really know where I am or how I got here”

Moss harrumphed, and seemed to take pleasure in my statement. He jabbed a finger at Harp “Didn’t I tell you? But no, Moss is just a storyteller trying to make up a new story”

I looked over a Sila who had sat beside me and I gave her a questioning look. She sort of nodded towards Moss and I looked back towards him.

“Moss, just because-“started Harp, before Moss interrupted

“A man drops from the sky in a flying metal carriage and you think a Banestorm is out of the question?” Moss seemed to match Pell in diction, which only made sense if he was given to public speaking.

*What the hell is a Banestorm?*

“What the h- what is a Banestorm?” I said, doing my best not to swear in front of what was as far as I knew a very sheltered group of people.

Pell and Harp both opened their mouths to speak, but we’d gotten the storyteller started and he wasn’t about to stop.

Moss assumed a deeper voice, and when he spoke his words had a rhythm to them “A Banestorm is a mighty verdant thunderstorm; it seizes the heroes and champions of worlds beyond the Veil and ensures that they are brought to those with great need. If a Banestorm has brought you here, it is because here is where you are needed.”

It was kinda quiet after he finished speaking, and I was glad that no one else was in the common room yet. *Damn. Why is this guy working for some twisted prankster with too much time and too much money? He should have his own show.*

“I don’t think I really make a very good hero, I’m not all that brave. And I don’t think I’m the champion of anything other than procrastination. I wouldn’t even know where to start”

*Serpentine powder, 75% saltpeter, 15% charcoal, 10% sulphur.*

“I think that’s enough for now Moss, let the boy rest.” Harp said, trying to calm Moss who seemed rather caught up in himself.

“How about a game of Zatrikion,” Pell suggested “You said you were educated and Moss here has all but lost. Know how to play?”

I looked at the board, and yeah, I was pretty sure that this was Chess alright. Moss had indeed all but lost. He had only a pawn and his king and it looked like Pell was trying to chase the king around on the board with a horse and two rooks.

“Sure, why not. This game is called Chess where I come from. Could you just go over the pieces quickly, some parts of the game might be different from what I’m used to.”

Pell went over what each piece did briefly, and there were three rules that I knew were relatively modern inventions that I needed to know about. The first was the queen being able to move as she did, and the pawn being able to move two spaces if it hasn’t yet moved, and castling. In Zatrikion castling and the pawns first turn were out, but the queen could still move as she liked.

As minor as the changes were it still changed the game quite a bit. Without castling it was harder to protect the king, but with the restrictions on the pawn the game was slightly slower. I lost the first game, but not by a lot. The second game I managed to force a stalemate, though it was in Pell’s favour.

“A third game?” I asked

“Certainly,” said Pell, “but when I play with Moss and the others we generally play for money”

“Oh no you don’t, don’t go trying to take the boy’s money.” Harp chastised.

*That’s the second time he’s called me boy.*

I withdrew my wallet from my pocket, “How much money are we talking about here? I don’t even know if my coins are worth anything to you” and I dumped out the coins onto the table in front of me.

It wasn’t much. 9.35$ Four toonies, one loonie, a quarter, and a dime. Canadian coins are pretty much just steel with nickel plating.

“Oh my,” said Sila, picking up the quarter. She’d been quiet up till now, though she’d managed to work her chair over until it was nearly touching mine. “Is this?”

“Nay girl, it’s not silver,” said Pell and he inspected the toonie “Though I’m not quite sure what it is.”

*Damn, not the blacksmith. A blacksmith would recognize steel when he saw it.*

“It’s steel,” I said “All the coins are steel, the only difference is the type of metal used to plate them. The silver colour comes from nickel, and the gold colour from brass”

“Steel? I’ve not heard of that before”

*Bronze age medieval village?*

“Steel is an alloy of iron and carbon, it’s very much like iron except it’s a bit stronger and more flexible. Steel won’t shatter like iron will.”

“Tell you what, I’ll buy one of these ones from you,” he said, indicating the toonies “I’ll give you 5 drachm for it, the workmanship is amazing and it would be nice as a showpiece for my smithy”

*BLACKSMITH! Called it.*

“Deal,” I said, scooping the rest of the coins into the little pouch in my wallet “Now how much is 5 drachm?”

I got a strange look from Pell and Harp before Moss pointed at me and said “Bane. Storm.” He punctuated each syllable with a jab of the finger.

Harp waved a hand at Moss “I charge 1 drachm a night for a room and two meals here, it can be more in a city though”

I slid four of the coins across the table to Harp.

“Ay, I already said it was no trouble. People got to take care of each other and money doesn’t factor into it”

“Alright,” I said, and I made a neat stack of four coins and set them next to the ch-Zatrikion board.

“Now hold on Quinn, don’t go betting all that against Pell. He’s real good and that’s about 2 days pay for most people” chided Harp.

“Well if you insist on not taking my money I’ve got to give it to someone. Pell is the obvious choice”

Harp sighed, and sat back in his chair. Pell and I began our game, and I had my strategy ready. He relied mostly on trying to whittle down his opponents pieces, leaving him with more than his opponent. But from there it generally deteriorated into him trying to chase the opposing king around the board. He hadn’t learned any openings, or any closing moves. He was careful how he made each move and didn’t tend to make mistakes but he was really only thinking a move or two ahead. I had lost the first and tied the second trying to get one of the openings I knew of to work with the altered rules. The lack of castling and the double move for pawns were both changes that fouled up a lot of the openers I had learned, but I had remembered the opening I wanted to use for game three. Pell was a good player, and had clearly played quite a lot but he hadn’t actually practiced, and he didn’t have any chess books. Probably none had even yet been written, and he certainly didn’t have the internet.

One modified Kings Indian Attack heralded the beginning of a much more interesting game. A lot of the mid-games I’d learned relied on the missing rules at least in some way so I had to wing a lot of it, but I still had the knowledge of several hundred years of experienced players to draw upon. Pell probably learned from his father, and his strategies were likely ones picked up from the tiny population of Zatrikion players in this town and the ones around it. Thirty minutes later I was 4 drachm richer.

Moss hooted and some of the spectators that had filed in around dinner congratulated me, I got slapped on the back a lot and tried not to make my discomfort obvious. I’ve never really been a fan of people touching me. “I don’t think I’ve ever seen Pell beaten like that,” said Moss. “Well done, and you tried to tell the boy to keep his money”

“I don’t suppose anyone else wants to play?” I said, grinning

One of the spectators opened his mouth to agree, before the woman next to him speared him with a glare. Probably the wife.

I didn’t manage to get myself another mark, but Pell did want to play some more. We played three more games, all with a one drachm bet. Pell managed to force a stalemate on one of them, but I won the other two and went to bed that night with 10 shiny new drachm.

-----------------------------------------------------

It was a week after the crash that I decided I couldn’t wait any longer. I was still in pretty rough shape and my head hurt like hell, but I hadn’t died yet of internal bleeding or a brain haemorrhage so I figured I was going to recover. I pulled on my jeans and shoes, resolving to walk all the way to the car and back without passing out or vomiting everywhere. I had been surprisingly successful at the whole, not vomiting thing. I knew that nausea was one of the symptoms of a concussion, and hoped that the fact that I’d not yet thrown up was an indicator that the concussion was not that bad.

“Oh!” Came Sila’s voice, “Are you leaving? You can’t be leaving now, you still look like you’re about to fall over most of the time.”

“You don’t need to worry about me, I just want to go see if there’s any of my things left in the ca-uh, carriage” I replied, waiting for an excuse that would keep me away from it.

“Okay, why don’t I go with you? You might need help.” Sila said brightly.

Sila had been spending a lot of time around me lately. I was doing my best not to get drawn into something I wasn’t ready for, but she seemed like she was doing her best to be helpful so I acquiesced.

“Alright, do you know if anyone has been there yet to look around in the carriage?”

“I don’t think so, there’s glass everywhere and Pappa told them to leave it alone until you had a chance to go check on your things”

“Hmmm,” I said, thinking “That was nice of him, I do have some stuff in the car that I want to get to”

I followed her downstairs and could hear Harp and Pell talking in the common room. I heard my name mentioned, but they stopped talking and looked up when Sila and I got downstairs. The ceiling in the common room was just tall enough for me to stand properly.

“Ah Quinn, you’re looking a bit better. You here to steal away more of my hard earned money?” he said in a friendly manner.

“No, I wanted to go see if I can salvage anything from my carriage,” I responded.

“Ah, do you mind if I come with you?” Asked Pell as he stood, and I could see he was wearing a blacksmith’s apron. “I want to get a look at your carriage is made of.”

“Certainly, I’m not sure where it is anyway.”

-----------------------------------------------------

Pell, Sila, and I walked through the village towards a hill in the distance. We had been walking for a short while when Pell spoke up.

“You mentioned that steel was an alloy of iron and carbon, do you know much about metallurgy?”

“Ah, maybe?” I hedged, thinking to the many hours spent playing Dwarf Fortress. “I think where I’m from is somewhat farther along when it comes to metallurgy as a field of study, but I’m not an expert by any definition. Why do you ask?”

“Well I’ve been thinking that I could use some help around the forge. Maybe you can show me how it is that steel is made, maybe you can’t. But you seem like the smart sort and I’m without a son to pass my trade onto.”

*Blacksmith, not a bad profession if I have to pick one. Smiths were generally the more affluent people in town and their skills were always in demand. My last name, Angove, even means smith.*

“That sounds like a rather good offer, I don’t know what else I could really do here. I think I’m going to need to do quite a bit of learning though.” I replied, not really certain what I’d agreed to.

“Oh it will be fine Quinn,” said Sila excitedly, turning to face me “I’m sure you’ll be just fine at it”

----------

We left the town and they led me out to the remains of my mighty Subaru. I survived that? Damn. It was sitting wheels up in a shallow stream that ran down the hill into the town. The water was barely deep enough to dampen the upholstery on the inside of the roof. Sila hadn’t been kidding about the glass. Every single window had shattered into tiny cubes, and the cubes were spread all around the car and up the side of the hill that lead to the forest. The grass in a mostly straight line up into the woods had been mostly flattened from the car sliding down the hill, but in two spots the sod was all torn up.

*It looks like the car rolled a couple of times after I passed out.*

I found both of the wing mirrors as I walked up the hill, broken off when the car rolled. My head started to throb as I continued walking up towards the tree line, and the nausea started to come back. It wasn’t as bad as before, but it was definitely still there. I found the tree, trees actually, that I had hit. It looked like I came in about 30ft off the ground, which made sense considering the height of the overpass, and hit two younger and shorter trees before slamming into an older and taller pine tree. The first two trees were missing about the top five or six feet, with the smashed bits lying in the underbrush around. I hadn’t been so lucky with the third tree. Instead of smashing off the top of the tree and slowing down a bit I had hit about the midpoint of the tree’s height. The tree stayed exactly where it was and it was the car that got smashed. I could see the impression of the back bumper on the ground under where I must have hit the old tree.

There was one thing conspicuously absent. The overpass? Well that one was obvious, there was no big concrete bridge with cars screaming along at 100kph, but that wasn’t actually the most concerning thing missing. The ground around the crash site, actually all the ground I’d walked across to get here, was rather damp and the grass had the squishy feeling you get when the ground is really soft. Maybe they cut the first two trees and bashed them up a little to make it look like a car and not a saw had done it. Maybe they’d brought the car here to the top of the hill and pushed it down, causing it to roll and slide into the stream.

Maybe all of that happened, but where the hell were the tracks? They’d need a flatbed to bring in the car judging from the state it was in. Assuming it didn’t get bogged down in the soft earth there should be two big rents in the ground leading to and from the tree. The ground should be torn up a little from the people they’d need to help with this. Hell I could see clearly where I’d torn up the sod where I’d walked up the hill. Even a couple people moving around here, getting things into position should have left some evidence. Instead, no footprints, no tyre tracks, nothing. And no damn big overpass either.

I looked back down the hill. Pell’s blurry form was poking around the car, Sila standing nearby. I could see her looking up at me, and I could see some hopefulness in the way she was standing there with her hands clasped in front of her.

*Fuck.*

---

I started back down the hill.

*I’m going to drive myself crazy if I keep playing mind games with myself. This was no prank. And I can’t keep on hedging, waiting for someone to jump out and start laughing at me. Everything I see, everything I’ve worked out tells me that this is the real deal. Maybe I’m crazy, but doubting my sanity is going to get me nowhere. Either I am crazy and there’s not really anything I can do about it, or I’m perfectly sane and doubting that is just going to push me over the edge. I’m sane, I’m on a continent called Elardia, in the kingdom of Rhona, and I live in a tavern in a town called Essens. And this is my life now.*

I dug around in the front of the car until I found my glasses. Thankfully the lenses weren’t damaged, and I only needed to bend one of the arms a little to get them to sit properly on my head. I finally got my first good look around, vision sharp and clear. I saw Pell taking a pair of tin snips to a piece of the front left quarter panel that was warped and smashed. I noticed for the first time that his ears were pointed, it wasn’t World of Warcraft level pointiness, but they could have taken a mould of his ear for the Vulcans in the new Star Trek movie. He was about the same height as Harp, probably 5’ 3” or 5’ 4”. Brown hair like Harp’s, drawn back into a short tail. His eyes were quite a bit larger than any human’s eyes could be. He didn’t wear a beard, and his skin had the same smoothness you might see on someone who had shaved not an hour before. *Elf*. I became rather aware of the fact that I hadn’t shaved in over a week. I raised a hand to my jaw to rub at the stubble that had been accumulating there.

I turned to look at Sila. She had long brown hair that trailed down past her shoulders. She was wearing a linen dress that had probably been dyed light blue quite a long time ago and it had faded quite a lot. She had fine features and prominent cheekbones, her chin came to a delicate point. She had full lips, slightly parted, and the same huge eyes. They were brown like her hair. It was a deep brown, brown like pools of chocolate so deep you could drown in them. I could see the way she was looking at me, and I was pretty sure she’d been giving me the same look since I’d first spoken to her. It was a look I couldn’t ever remember being directed at myself, and it was a look that made me realize just what I lacked.

And it was exactly what I didn’t want.

*Is this what the rest of my life is going to be then? I’m going to learn Pell’s trade and work his smithy when he’s gone? Am I going to marry Sila and have a family, what the hell would I even tell any children I’d have? I could never relate to the world that they’d be growing up in. Am I supposed to live in a world where bloodletting is considered treatment and people think that it’s bad spirits that make people sick? I don’t want this, I’m not Moss’s damn hero. I’m a computer geek from Canada, I’m used to a level of luxury that’s probably even beyond what this world’s Kings can match. I’m used to a level of technology and constant entertainment that this world can never match. And there’s Sila standing there, looking at me like that. This might be the first time anyone has ever looked at me like that, but it just isn't enough. Fuck I’m a selfish bastard, but I can’t live like some medieval peasant for the rest of my life.*

“Sila, could you give me a hand here?” I said, trying to force down the angsty navel gazing and keep the bitterness out of my voice. “I want to gather my stuff and head back to the tavern, my head is killing me”

Sila and I gathered my things while Pell cut some pieces from the bodywork with his tinsnips, and we headed back. Once I was back in my room, Sila shadowing me still, I spread out what I had gathered on the bed.


# Chapter 3

I could see Quinn sitting with his back to one of the old oak trees just downhill from the village. The leaves had started to change their colours, and Quinn’s oak tree looked like it might have been burning with all the oranges and reds in its leaves. He was reading one of Pell’s books again and seemed lost in thought. He had his chin propped up on one hand and his brow was furrowed as he looked down at the book. He’d been recovering rather quickly, but ever since we had been to the remains of his carriage the previous week he had seemed more distant.

“I brought you something,” I said, which seemed to startle him. He jumped slightly and looked up.

“Oh sorry, I just thought you might be hungry,” And I held out the picnic basket. He seemed to hesitate slightly before answering. It was something he did a lot when talking to me, and I had noticed him doing it more and more often in the past week.

“Thank you Sila,” he said, placing one of those little paper cards into the book and closing it.

As I spoke I laid out the blanket that I’d kept folded under the basket’s handle “You’ve been reading that book a lot, what’s so special about it?”

“It’s the history book you brought me the first day after the crash, I read it the once to pass the time, but I didn’t know what I was looking for then. I’m trying to do a better job of actually studying it now.”

“How do you find something new in a book? You said that you’d read it already.” I asked, as I set out the lunch I had made for the two of us.

Auntie Crisa had been the one to teach me how to cook, and she told me that cooking a good meal for your betrothed was one of the best ways to spend time together without being improper. Auntie Crisa seemed to want to make sure that everything was ‘proper’, but it seemed like good advice even if Quinn and I weren’t betrothed. So I put together a picnic for the two of us and I’d made everything myself, I didn’t have much to work with but Quinn seemed to like the stew I’d made for him the first day we’d met. So I’d made some more of that and wrapped up the bowls in cloth to keep them warm. I also had made some rolls which were fresh out of the oven and kept warm by the stew. I brought along just a little bit of butter to go with them. This was the first time since he’d started taking his meals in the common room that’d we’d sat and eaten together without anyone else bothering us. Sure we’d have dinner in the common room, but it wasn’t the same. There were always people sitting at other tables, or he’d be playing Zatrikion with Pell. Pell was also stealing Quinn away, often when I went looking for Quinn when Pappa didn’t need my help I’d find that he was with Pell learning how to run the forge.

“Moss and Pell seemed to think that my being a Mage was entirely possible, and I can tell just from looking at the people in the village that I’m not the same species as the rest of you. Though it doesn’t seem to bother you, which seems to suggest that you’re used to seeing people like me, or at least people not like yourselves. I’m looking to see if I can find references to magic or to the different races. I’m still having a hard time reconciling everything I see around me and everything that’s happened with what I know. Or at least what I thought I knew. Only trouble is, this book reads more like a list of dates and important battles. There’s not a lot of detail given for any one event.” Quinn replied, as he started to eat.

Quinn spoke a lot differently than anyone I’d ever heard. He spoke even more precisely than the Baron or any of his sons, but unlike them he never seemed to raise his voice. Even to be heard in the common room when it was noisy at the table all he would do is repeat himself. Instead the others around the table would quiet down so they could hear what he was saying. The Baron and his sons seemed to try to control a group by being the one to shout the loudest. His voice was also deeper, and he seemed very deliberate about his wording, taking his time with each word. It gave his voice a low rumbling quality.

“Don’t they have Mages where you’re from? And haven’t you ever seen an elf or a dwarf or a gnome before?” I asked.

“No actually, I take it that you believe in magic? And I’m guessing you’re an, elf?” He said hesitantly “Which is not to say that I don’t believe you, it’s just where I’m from the only ‘magic’ is stage magic, sleight of hand, and trickery”

“Oh it’s alright,” I said brightly, happy that he was asking about me “I’ve never actually seen anyone do magic, but I’m an elf, and I’ve seen dwarves and gnomes sometimes when they pass through town. There’s even a gnome in town now, he’s probably going to be the last trader we’re going to get before the snow closes the pass out of the valley. What about you? You can’t be something like an orc, you’re the right size, but you’re the wrong colour and always very polite.”

“Thank you,” Quinn said, smiling, “Well I’m a human, but I don’t really know if that explains anything if you’ve never met a human before. What about these gnomes and dwarves, why do they sometimes come through the town?”

“Well dwarves have some of their mountain-homes north of here and I guess when they travel they sometimes come through the valley. Gnomes sometimes live in the foothills near dwarven mountains, and we always get a couple gnome traders in the fall as they’re heading back home. The valley is supposed to be one of the safer ways for them to get back, and they always like to trade for food from the farms”

Quinn finished his bite of roll and asked “What makes the valley here safer than the other options? I don’t even know really how this place is laid out”

“Well the valley is this strip between the two mountain ranges, you see the one over there?” I said pointing to the mountains to the east, ”and the ones over there?” I said pointing west, ”Well they stretch really far north, and they sort of meet up if you go far enough. Pell said that the dwarves have their mountain home up there somewhere in the north. There’s five villages all spread through the length of the valley, which means that the trader can stop and get supplies every night. The only people that really come to the tavern from outside the valley are the gnomes and dwarves passing through. There’s more mountains past the ones you can see, and there’s valleys and other ways through but none of the other valleys go the whole way north, and the passes are hard to get through even in summer. Especially if you’ve got a couple of horse drawn carts.”

There hadn’t really been anything I could help him with once he was able to get up and walk around, and he always asked someone else when he had a question. Usually it was Harp or Pell. It was nice to have him pay the same sort of attention to me for a change. It was a little frightening though, he always looked whoever he was talking to right in the eye and it was a very intense look. They were only half the size of an elf’s eyes and were shaded by a prominent brow. They were green like Moss's eyes, though Quinn's were a much darker shade.

“So there’s a trader in town, and he’s a gnome,” he said, seeming to think about it “Well I suppose I should go see what he has on offer. I might be able to get some of the materials I’ll need for a blast furnace”

I quickly started to gather the things, not wanting him to go without me “I hope you don’t mind if I come along?” I said as I cleaned up.

“Sure,” he said deliberately “I’ve not really had to try to trade for anything yet, Harp is still refusing to take my money. It would be good to have you along, I’m still not sure about the worth of these coins anyways”

I felt a little tightness in my chest, *Auntie Crisa always takes care of her husband’s money* “Y-es I can help you with that”

Quinn stood up, and up, and up from where he was sitting. He really was a giant, I don’t think I’ve ever seen anyone as tall as Quinn. He didn’t look quite like anyone else either. He had the sharp features of an elf, the of squareish face and jaw of a dwarf, and the close cut brown hair and stubble of a gnome. It should have made him look ugly with such a mix of different features, but the fine cheekbones and strong jaw darkened by his short beard blended together into something handsome and entirely unique. His skin was pale, like a dwarf’s or a Lord’s. No one could ever mistake him for a dwarf, towering head and shoulders over even her father who was the tallest man in the whole valley.

*I can see why Pell thought he was a Lord.*

Fair skin, soft hands, and absolutely perfect teeth. I’ve had always taken good care of my teeth, but I’d still cover them with my hand or bow my head when I smiled. Some were crooked, a one or two were missing, and those not missing were slightly yellowed. It was nothing terrible, but it seemed woefully inadequate compared to Quinn. Quinn’s looked like they might be made of marble, and they all stood straight like perfect little soldiers, not a single one out of place, and not a single one missing.

It’s why I’ve been trying so hard to get his notice, Quinn was amazing, and he was probably the only man in the entire valley other than Anthior that wasn’t already married or betrothed to someone else. I can remember the last time Auntie Crisa took me to meet Anthior, it had not gone well. Auntie had been taking me to see Antior every feast day, and I knew exactly what Auntie was thinking. The Baron trying to find a wife for his sixth and youngest son, and I was probably the only girl in the whole valley that hadn’t yet found someone. Anthior was a little shorter and that seemed to upset him a lot, when he wasn’t being cruel to me he was trying to put his greasy hands all over me. He tried to pull me down onto his lap last time and that’s when I finally slapped him, and I did it hard enough to leave a mark. Auntie was furious, she seemed to think it was ‘improper’, but it had made Anthior let go and I haven’t been made to go see him on any of the feast days since then. I just wish that Quinn would be half as interested in pulling me into his lap, I wouldn’t mind a little manhandling from him. The couple of times I had brushed against his hand or his chest had been a little exciting and I’ve been doing my best to come up with more excuses to do it. His hands were hot to the touch, and his jumper, a ‘hoodie’ he called it, was so soft. I just want to sit in his lap and bury my face in it.

*I wish I hadn’t told him about the trader, otherwise we might have been able to sit here for a while longer.*

Quinn helped me fold up the blanket and I tucked it back under the handle of the basket.

“What’s a blast furnace anyway? Is it something Pell needs for the forge?”

“Yes and no,” said Quinn “You remember the coins? They were all made of steel, and to make steel you need a blast furnace. Mostly, well if we want to make steel we need a blast furnace I guess. Pell can already work with bronze and the other softer metals just fine, he’s been doing it for longer than I’ve been alive. Iron however is apparently only worked by the forges in the larger cities, and even then it’s only made in very small batches. Steel is apparently unknown, though I’d be willing to bet that some of the larger city forges are actually turning out low grade steel, rather than iron, even if it’s only by accident. I need a blast furnace to have any hope of producing steel. Even if I can’t quite manage to get it perfect, whatever I do manage to assemble will probably give Pell what he needs to start working with iron. That could be a big help, since apparently it’s not really possible to get iron out this far. At least not for any economical price.”

Quinn continued his explanation and I did my best to understand what he was saying “I honestly can’t remember if it’s the higher airflow that the blast furnace provides that allows iron and carbon to alloy properly, or if it’s the higher temperature. I’m guessing it’s some combination of the two, probably the increased airflow mainly serves to raise the temperature in the forge. And it’s the high temperature that’s important for working iron, and hopefully, steel”

“Um, what does economical mean?” I asked, trying to make sense of the rest of what he’d said.

Quinn took a moment before responding, “In this case it means reasonable, it’s not possible to get iron out this far for any reasonable price. The city forges have a hard enough time making it, and they haven’t shared the secret with anyone outside their circle so barely anyone else is making it outside of that small group”

“Where did you learn about all of this then, if they’re keeping it a secret? Did you get taught about it by your teachers?”

“Ah,” he hesitated “Well I was taught metallurgy by a man named Tarn Adams. Then I did some more reading on the internet, it’s sort of like a really big library. It’s got books and articles on pretty much anything you want to know”

“Does it take a long time to learn all this?”

“Ah well kindergarten, which is the first sort of school most people go to starts when you’re about 5 years old. Most people my age are just about at the end of their schooling. It usually takes up about 8 months of the year, with the other 4 off for a break. Though sometimes people will use the break to work once they get older.”

He started school when he was 5 years old and has still been in school for all this time? The only time I ever went to a school was to learn maths so I could help Pappa at the tavern without getting cheated. What does he think about me? I can’t even read.

I bowed my head, clutching the basket and trying not to let Quinn see my face turn red with embarrassment.

“Do you think you’ll be able to make steel for Pell?” I asked, trying to move on to something else

“Probably not,” he said, matter-of-factly “I think I can remember everything I need, and how to assemble the furnace but I’m not sure. I doubt I can get any of it from the trader which means that Pell and I probably need to make the pieces by hand, and even then, the sort of furnace I’m familiar with is one that needs to be taken half apart to get the steel ingot back out. It’s not really economical, reasonable rather, for anything other than making weapons. Especially since you can really only make one ingot at a time. I don’t think Pell can really justify the cost, even if it would turn out a fantastic sword who would he sell it too? Who could even afford what its worth? The current plan is for an upgrade to his existing furnace, that I’m pretty sure I can do, and it should still let him work with iron.”

It surprised me. Whenever Quinn talked about anything it always seemed like he knew exactly what to do and how to do it. *Is this what’s had him distracted this past week, trying to figure out how to make steel for Pell? It didn’t seem like it, but I didn’t know what else might be bothering him* “I’m sure you can figure it out,” I said, trying to reassure him.

He smiled a little, “You’re probably right, it’s not like I don’t have the time to figure it out.”

-----

Sila continued to walk along beside me as we got into the town, which was really only about a dozen houses and some other buildings. I had been doing my best not to string her along since I realized what she had in mind. But did that even apply? Where the hell was I going to go? I had some ‘Lord Kalvan of Otherwhen’ like visions of total world domination though the liberal application of gunpowder, but it wasn’t really realistic. Calvin and I had both been injured when we first arrived in ‘Otherwhen’, but Calvin had been nursed to health in a castle. He’d been taken in by a Lord who was more than willing to provide the resources, funds, and manpower to back his inventions. I’d woken up in a village that lived mostly on subsistence farming and exported only some surplus foodstuffs. Calvin’s Otherwhen had even already gotten started with gunpowder and firearm production. All Calvin needed to do was tighten up the formula used and introduce rifled barrels. Instead I’d need to figure out where the hell to find sulphur, and try to make the tools I’d need to manufacture muskets or rifles to the proper tolerances.

It wasn’t as if Sila wasn’t pretty enough, I kept getting lost in her big brown eyes when I was talking to her. I’d been doing my best not to be obvious about it, though she’d probably noticed. While her education was somewhat lacking due to the environment she’d grown up in she wasn’t stupid. That’s one mistake people tend to make about historical civilizations. The average medieval peasant was no less intelligent than the average Canadian software developer, the only difference was the educational material and technology available. Sure, ask the peasant to solve an algebraic equation and he won’t give you anything close to an answer, but try teaching the peasant algebra? Well it’s very likely that he’d learn at a similar rate to a modern human in his age group.

Just like I’d needed to come to grips with the fact that I was indeed in some other world where Tim Horton’s and the internet didn’t exist, I needed to come to grips with the fact that there was a very good chance that the rest of my life was going to be spent in this valley. If that life was spent with Sila, maybe it wouldn’t be so bad, but I couldn’t quite shake the desire for more.

-----

We made our way to Harp’s tavern, the merchant had pulled up out front and he seemed to be wrapping up most of his business. There weren’t a whole lot of people in the town, and they didn’t have a whole lot of money to spend so the little gnome gotten through the crowd already. And oh yes, he was a gnome. There was no mistaking him for either a human or an elf, for starters he was only three feet tall. He seemed to be the first creature I’d met that kept his hair short, and he was the first one with any facial hair though that too was trimmed. His skin was an odd shade of brown. Don’t get me wrong, it’s not like I’ve never seen a brown guy before, I lived in Toronto, it’s about as multicultural as a city gets. This guy however didn’t match any of the dozens of skin tones I’d seen on the streets of Toronto, instead he was the same reddish brown colour as the clay soil around Prince Edward Island.

“Ah, it’s a pleasure to meet you,” said the gnome, extending a small hand. I had expected a tiny and high pitched voice, but instead his voice was more or less the same as anyone else I had met. He did speak very quickly, but his pronunciation was clear and I could understand what he was saying without too much trouble.

I shook the offered hand “Oh careful you, don’t carry me away,” said the gnome in his rapid fire voice.

He managed to get a smile out of me, despite me moping around about the possibility of spending the rest of my life as a smith. “I don’t suppose you’ve got a stack of bricks and some mortar somewhere in there,” I said, indicating the pair of wagons he had, each pulled by two horses.

“You know, no one has ever asked me for house building materials before,” he replied, not quite sure what to make of the question “I’m afraid I’m somewhat light on brick and mortar”

“What about some bellows?”

“I’m afraid not”

“What about springs?” I asked, enjoying the game, Sila starting to giggle beside me.

He frowned and his eyebrows drew together “Ah, possibly?” He showed me some metallic bits and bobs he’d collected, but none looked anywhere close to the size I’d need.

*Hell, I should check the car. I bet I can get most of what I need, masonry aside, from the wreck.*

“I guess it will have to be books then”

“Now books I can do, just over here,” he said, happy to have won the game. “Is there anything in particular?”

*How am I supposed to ask for books about magic, I going to seem like an idiot or a cra-*

“Magic!” provided Sila, “Do you have any books on magic? That is what you wanted, right Quinn?”

*Well there’s that sorted*

“Yes, anything on magic?” I said resignedly, though Sila seemed excited.

“Why I do have a book on magic,” He said, as he reached up and pulled out a book wrapped in brown paper “It even includes a couple spells that the beginner might learn”

*If magic is real,* ***AND I CAN LEARN IT-***

“It’s yours for only 50 drachm” he said, and Sila’s shoulders slumped.

*Nearly a month’s wages, so he’s trying to scam me then. Argghhh, I have to know! If I let this pass me by I’m never going to be able to put it out of my mind. I will forever be thinking about what might have been. I* ***need*** *that book*

“I don’t think you’re going to find anyone here with 50 drachm to give you before you get all the way home, would you consider a trade instead?” I asked.

“Well that depends, what do you have to offer me?” he said, crossing his arms and leaning against the wagon, package held in one hand.

I withdrew my wallet, and took out blue 5$ note, a red 10$ note, a green 20$ note, and a red 50$ note. All were of the new polymer type of bill, with a clear window forming a strip down one side. They were all also in very good shape, and despite the Royal Canadian Mint’s assertions, I still thought that they smelled slightly of maple syrup.

“I will trade for the book, in exchange for any two of these pieces.” I said, hoping that the strange material and artwork would be enough to catch the gnome’s eye. The twenty even has a picture of the queen on it, that’s got to be worth something.

The gnome leaned up inspecting the bills, and I worried for a moment that he’d recognize that what I was trying to sell him was useless plastic. “I’ll give you the book for all four of the notes.”

“Three notes of your choosing,” I countered

“All four notes, anddd… 5 drachm,” came his counter

“Deal,” I said, handing him the collection of ‘artwork’

He handed over the book, still wrapped in paper, and dug around in his coin pouch for the promised money. *Hmm, none of the other books are wrapped up.* I shook the package and heard something bump against the book inside the paper wrapping. He handed over the coins and we said our goodbyes, the gnome apperantly not having anything of interest to Sila.

*I’ve just bought a book that will allegedly teach me magic, for 85$ Canadian. Why do I feel like this makes perfect sense?*

-----

I ducked into the tavern to see if Pell was still here after eating lunch, since he was expecting me back at the forge at some point, and that was the last place I wanted to be right now. He was sitting talking to Harp over a game of Zatrikion at a table near the bar. The game was quickly wrapping up, Pell having learned some closing strategies from me. He looked up as the door opened.

“You got a new book.” he said knowingly.

“Yeah,” I said, grinning.

“Fine, we’re pretty much done at the forge,” he said in a tone of understanding, “I picked up a couple new ones myself”

“Alright, see you for supper then Pell,” I said waiting for Sila. She scurried into the back room to put the basket and dishes away before following me back outside

-----

I had thought better of taking the book up to my room, Sila would undoubtedly be interested and want to follow, and the less time we spent alone in bedrooms the better. *At least for now.*

Instead we made our way back to the Oak tree. As we scaled the hill I looked down at the paper wrapped package in my hand. I noticed that my hand was shaking, and I was leaving indentations on the cover of the book with my fingers.

*Calm, relax. Manage expectations, this probably* ***is*** *a book of fairy tales.* ***But if it isn’t.***

I kept my breathing under control and put the package into the front pocket of my hoodie.

“So, do you think it can really teach magic?” Sila asked, she had been totally quiet the whole way back to the tree. I think she recognized my apprehension.

“I don’t know,” I said, my voice coming out somewhat hoarse.

We walked the rest of the way up to the tree and I sat down against it. Sila took this opportunity to sit down as close to me as possible, any closer and she’d be in my lap. As it was, having her pressing lightly against my side was not unwelcome.

I pulled my folding knife out of the pocket of my jeans and flicked it open.

“Oh my, that’s quite the knife” commented Sila.

I cut the paper on the top of the package, careful not to nick the book. I turned over the package and shook it, and a small round crystal about the size of a pea dropped into my hand. I held it up to the light of the sun. It wasn’t glass, I was sure of that much at least. It was as clear and colourless as any modern glass, but it was much heavier than glass would be and was cut with several facets. *Magic rock?* I slid the book out of the package and put the paper wrapper in the pocket of my jeans. *Always good to have more note taking material.*

“What does it say?” Asked Sila, looking at the cover.

“‘An Introduction to Practical Magic’, by Lili Nidur,” I said “I really hope this is worth it” and I opened the book to the first page.

The first couple pages were an introduction by the author, and didn’t tell me anything that I didn’t already know. The first proper chapter however was titled ‘What makes a Mage’. *This is what I’ve been looking for.* I read on, and discovered something worrisome. According to the book not just anyone could be a Mage, you had to be born a mage. And according to the book only about 1 person in 50 had the ability to use magic and so the potential to be a Mage. *Great, an easy out. ‘It’s not my fault it didn’t work, this book is perfectly genuine, you’re just not a Mage.’* The book went on to explain that magical talent was apparently a quantifiable value determined at birth, and could only be raised through great effort. The distribution was apparently logarithmic. Those with the ability to use magic, but no talent were called ‘wizards’, and they made up 90% of the ‘1’ from the 1 in 50. The remaining 10% were mages, with varying levels of magical talent.

Soo, out of 5000 people, 90 are wizards, 10 are mages, and one of those 10 mages is of the next… level? dan? tier? up from the rest of his fellows. How the hell am I supposed to know if I’m in the lucky 2%?

The book went on to explain that there was a school dedicated to the study and practice of magic in the city of Nimre.

*Magical.* ***School.***

There was a map that appeared to cover the entire continent of Elardia, and it placed Nimre and its school on the western coast of the continent. I could see the mountain range that held the valley I was currently in. It was on the southern coast where it appeared an India-like sub-continent had collided with the larger Elardian tectonic plate, throwing up the mountain range. The mountain range was a rather uncomfortable distance away from the location of the school, about three quarters of the continent and a mountain range stood between myself and the school. But I knew, that there was no force on earth that would keep me from that school if I had even a flicker of magical power. There was no scale on the map, but I guessed that it wasn’t a short trip.

Almost all of the remaining pages were dedicated to five basic spells to get the neophyte Wizard or Mage started. Not the five most basic, but a selection that were supposed to be easy to learn. Ignite, Detect Magic, Light, Apportation, and Seek Water.

The last few pages explained the admittance policy, which appeared rather strict for Wizards, but rather lax for Mages. There was even a stipend for Mages studying at the school, based on their… *fine, ‘level’,* of magical talent. I was worried that I might be too old to enrol, I was 22 after all. I had an image in my head of a bunch of 11 year olds going to Hogwarts for the first time, with one six and a half foot tall giant walking down the Grand Hall to be sorted by the Sorting Hat. Thankfully this was not the case, the Nimre University apparently accepted students of any age. There was one problem however.

“Sila, what’s the current year?” I asked, concerned

“It’s 253, why?” She replied, confused.

“There’s apparently a magical school in Nimre, but they do student intake for people my age every four years. The next intake according to this is mid-spring, 254.”

*I had maybe five months to cross a continent. Less, since if I leave now I’m going to get caught in the mountains in the middle of winter. Three months, three months if I left at the very end of winter, to hit the mountains at the beginning of spring. I don’t even know if that’s smart, early spring is nearly as dangerous as winter in the mountains. And if I’m late to the party, then I’m going to be very late.*

“You said something about the levels, how are we supposed to know if we’re even mages?” she asked, resting her cheek against my shoulder and peering at the book.

*We?*

“That’s what this crystal is for apparently,” I said, holding it up “It’s called a ‘Mage Stone’ and can be used to measure someone’s magical talent”

“Can I try it?” She asked, turning her face up to look at me, her huge brown eyes hopeful.

“Hold on a moment, I still don’t know how it’s supposed to work.”

I read a little further and it explained that the stone would glow with a varying level of brightness depending on the magnitude of the talent being directed at the stone. It spent a few more pages explaining just how to ‘direct your talent’ which amounted essentially to some basic meditation techniques I was already familiar with, and then a ‘push’ on the stone with your Will.

“Why don’t I try this first, I’m already somewhat familiar with meditation and it might take a little while for me to teach you” I said quietly.

Sila seemed surprised at my comment about being familiar with meditation, but she nodded “Okay, do you need me to do anything?”

“Just be quiet, this might take a little while” I said shifting around to get comfortable, Sila nodding silently.

I adjusted the bezel on my watch to note the current position of the minute hand. Then I closed my eyes and focused on my breathing, the deliberate rhythm helping me keep stray thoughts from my mind. Once my mind was well and clear I began to imagine the inside of a watch. With this sort of meditation it was not enough to merely think ‘watch’ and be done with it. It also didn’t need to be a watch either, it could be whatever you wanted, flower, fire, sculpture, anything. But you had to be able to imagine it in every minute detail, you had to see it in your mind’s eye as clearly as if you were looking at it under a magnifying glass. It’s not a sort of meditation that works for anyone and it’s best for people that are visual and practical learners, but it’s very effective if you’re in that category. Visualization also takes quite some time, though this was an image I had used many times before so it was somewhat quicker than it would otherwise be. I was probably over doing it, the book only mentioned the breathing exercise, but I had to do this right the first time. I had no idea how any of this worked, but I had a hypothesis. I had guessed that even if someone was a mage they could block themselves off from their power by failing to succeed the first time they tried to use one of these stones. A failure the first time would colour all the attempts afterwards, and they wouldn’t be able to put the same force behind any subsequent attempt with each failure reinforcing the belief that they didn’t have any power.

Without opening my eyes, I pushed. The book suggested that you call up a strong memory, one that defined your desire for magic. Every want and need you would fulfill with magic, all distilled into a single memory. Instead I used just two words.

***I WILL***

-----

Immediately I could feel heat on my face, like the heat you’d feel lying in the sun, despite my spot in the shade. The heat on my hand was nearly unbearable but there was no way in hell that I was dropping this crystal. I opened my eyes, and the glare was blinding. I could just make out Sila beside me, face turned in to my shoulder to block the light. I closed my hand around the crystal and relaxed my mental hold on it, letting out a breath that I hadn’t realized I was holding. The heat in my hand disappeared, and the light winked out.

Sila looked up at me, rubbing at her eyes “It worked, it worked!” she exclaimed, unable to contain her excitement. She put a hand on the back of my neck and pulled herself up to kiss me. And damn, did she mean it. She pressed herself into me, wrapping both arms tightly around my neck. My right hand found her lower back, and my left cupped her face. We stayed like that for a while before she pulled away slightly. Her eyes were watering, her lips were a little puffy, and she had turned bright red. But she didn’t take her arms from around my neck, instead she put her head against my chest and let out a long sigh. I closed my eyes and bowed my head, nose nuzzling her hair as I pulled her in tighter.

*Oh man, I really needed that.*

A short time later I leaned back against the tree, Sila in my lap, and I adjusted my glasses slightly with one hand. They’d been pushed askew when she kissed me, I took a guilty look around, but didn’t see any potential observers. Most of the townsfolk would be working at this hour anyway, our little secret was safe. I looked down at my watch. 17 minutes. A damned eventful 17 minutes too. We sat there for a while longer with our arms around each other, before she decided that it was her turn.

I took my time and explained meditation to her, using the simplified version that the book recommended. Granted, I had used the more advanced meditation technique to get my results, but I didn’t want to make matters more complicated by trying to teach her how visualization worked. It took practice, and an error in the meditation method might translate to an error in the test. Best then to stick to as simple a meditation method as possible, which is probably why the book recommended the one that it did.

I finished my explanations and Sila slipped out of my lap and sat cross legged on the ground in front of me, crystal cupped in her hands. I could see her relaxing into it, head drooping, and her breaths became deeper and less frequent. She sat like that for nearly an hour, before I saw her steel herself, and **push.**

I could see her relaxing into it, head drooping, and her breaths became deeper and less frequent. She sat like that for nearly an hour, before I saw her steel herself, and **push.**

-----

Nothing. There wasn’t a flicker of light from the stone.

*Oh.*

Sila opened her eyes and looked at the stone, frowning. She met my eyes and froze. I think she saw something she didn’t like in the way that I was looking at her. She put a hand to her mouth and choked back a sob, tears forming in her eyes.

“H-here,” she said, half shoving the tiny crystal into my hands.

She stood up and turned away from me, covering her face with her hands and hunching her shoulders. Finally she couldn’t hold it back any longer, and she started sobbing as she ran off down the hill. I sat there quietly, watching her go.

*Good job Quinn. ‘No force on earth would keep me from that school’, not mountains or rivers, not bandits or soldiers, and not Sila. I was right, I am a selfish bastard.*

I let out a long breath, and looked down at the crystal in my hand.

*Well, I guess I got what I wanted didn’t I.*

I waited a while, sitting under the big oak tree. I didn’t really want to walk back into the tavern and face Sila or Harp right now. Hell, for all I knew Harp might think that a marriage between Sila and I was a forgone conclusion. Then he finds out that I’m going to drop Sila like a sack of potatoes and fuck off to Nimre? I’ll be lucky if I still have a bed to sleep in tonight.

*Well I might as well look over the spells I’ve got, and give Harp some time to cool off*

I flipped the book open to the section on spells. There were five collected in the book, Ignite, Detect Magic, Light, Apportation, and Dowsing. Ignite was what it sounded like, a little fire starter spell. At the end of the section on the spell was a table. It showed the amount of mana *Mana? Cool.* required to ignite various types of wood. It took one mana to ignite tinder, two for kindling, three for softwood, and four for hardwood.

*What the heck is that in Joules, or would it be Watts? How much mana do I have, is it related to the level of magical talent, or is it separate entirely? Even igniting tinder has got to be a decent amount of thermal energy, and is that all coming from me?*

It was somewhat hard to tell, but it seemed like the book had been put together in a rush. Like all the books I’d read so far it was handwritten, *Note to self: moveable type*, but the penmanship in it was far messier than the handwriting in any of Pell’s books. It explained the basics of all the spells, but seemed to skip over answering even the most obvious follow up questions that most people would want to ask. The description of admittance requirements and intake schedule was verbose by comparison.

Detect Magic was also pretty much what it said on the tin. Aside from telling me whether something was magical or not it would also tell me the type of magic, and whether or not it was permanent.

*Type of magic? I wonder if we’re talking a D&D style Evocation/Illusion/Abjuration system of classification, or is this an elemental Fire/Water/Earth/Air system? Another thing not explained.*

The Light spell seemed useful, though it still wasn’t very precise about the units and figures involved. A table like the one from the Ignite spell gave three rather unhelpful references for mana per brightness. One mana for candle equivalent, and two for torch equivalent. Both options would last for one minute.

*So 1 mana buys me 1 candela, but 2 mana buys me, what, 50 candela?*

The next paragraph explained how I could change the colour of the light. It went on to mention that coloured light in general and red light specifically wouldn’t interfere with dark-adaption, and recommended using coloured light when traveling at night.

*I wonder how the spell defines colour. Am I limited to the visual spectrum, or can I make an X-Ray ‘coloured’ light? Don’t know how useful that would be, but maybe I can find a use in something else from the electromagnetic spectrum. Assuming I can even create ‘lights’ that aren’t just visual light*

Finally I could also change the light’s shape. I could have an omni-directional light, or a beam. The book went on to describe how a narrower beam would use less energy than a wider beam, and a wide beam would use less energy than an omni-directional light.

*Does this spell have a cap on how much energy can be put into it? Because if there isn’t one I could narrow down the beam to one degree and dump a whole lot of energy in. That would definitely make an X-Ray light useful, pretty sure getting shot with an X-Ray laser would suck.*

The next spell was Apportation which was just a fancy way of saying Telekinesis. One unit of mana would let me lift 10lbs and move it around for a full minute. Two units would let me do 20lbs for one minute, or 10lbs for two minutes. Three units was 30lbs or three minutes, and so on.

*Ten pounds for one minute, for one mana. That meant that one mana bought me **at least** 60 seconds at 1g of acceleration against a 10lb weight, since at the very least the spell needs to counteract the pull of gravity. Uhh… F=MA, 10lbs is about 4.5kgs, and at 9.8m/s that’s…*

I pulled out the wrapper I’d saved from the package and scribbled the relevant equations on it. *I’m going to need a lot more paper if I’m really doing this mage thing*

*So 44.1 Newtons per second for sixty seconds, or 2646 Newtons per second for one second. That doesn’t even count any energy used to move the object from side to side. Doesn’t that mean I could get a 1kg object up to 2646m/s? To hell with lasers, magic-railgun is where it’s at.*

This gave me reason to pause, one mana was 44.1 Newtons per minute? But it was also either 1 or 25 candela for one minute? It shouldn’t be either 1 or 25 candela, what it should be is 44.1 Watts. I couldn’t remember how the conversion from candela to Watts might go, but I was pretty sure that I should be getting something like 50 to 250 candela per Watt.

*Maybe it’s a matter of efficiency? But you’d think that making a light would be a hell of a lot more efficient than trying to move something around.*

The last spell was Dowsing, which would give me a distance and heading to the nearest significant source of water.

“A human is what, 60% water? I wonder if I could finagle this into a tracking spell?”

I flipped back through the spells, trying to decide which one to start on first. I had no idea how long it would take to learn each one, but I wanted something immediately useful. That basically meant Light, or Apportation. Light seemed really useful, but the D-Cells in the Mag-Lite could last a long damn time. I went for Apportation.

“Use the force Quinn”

-----

By the time I got back to town the sun had started to go down and it was starting to get rather chilly. There were only a few leaves on the ground, it was still early Autumn, and they were blown around by the cool breeze.

It had taken some time to sort out how the book was trying to teach the spell. There were arcane symbols on the first several pages, and the book explained a few memorization exercises that you were meant to follow. I wasn’t sure how it was supposed to teach me how to cast the spell, but something about the symbols seemed to almost tickle my brain. I had the same feeling I’d get when a name was on the tip of my tongue. There were also gestures and incantations to go along with the spell, but the book didn’t just give me one set of gestures, and one set of incantations. There were multiple sets of diagrams, each one more complicated than the last. The gestures could be done one or two handed, and with our without either a wand or a staff.

*If this is anything like Harry Potter and 90% of people need wands to use magic then I need to learn wandless magic ASAP. I don’t want to carry around a big sign saying ‘Hey everybody, I’m a mage!’ and I also don’t want my power to be jeopardized if I accidentally lose a freaking stick.*

There were also some dance steps that the book said would help first timers and novices cast the spell if they were having difficulty.

There weren’t quite as many different combinations when it came to the incantations, really the only difference was the length and whether the incantation was sung or simply spoken.

*At least there’s no material costs, I’d go through bat guano by the ton*

-----

I steeled myself for the coming confrontation, and pushed open the door. It was rather busy, all the regulars were here, along with some people who had come in from their farms or other villages. They’d be staying at the tavern tonight to enjoy the feast day festivities tomorrow. I could see Harp sitting at a table with Moss, Pell, and some of the other people in town that played Zatrikion. He looked up when the little bell over the door rang.

*Here we go*

“Quinn!” He said loud enough to carry over the noise of the busy tavern, and spread his hands in an exasperated manner “How could you have done this?”

*Ah shit, I guess we’re having this out in front of everyone*

I walked over, and sat in the only empty chair remaining at the table. Moss was leaning back in his chair with a self-satisfied smile on his face some reason. *Has he been holding something against me and I didn’t notice?*

“What’s this Scholar’s Mate nonsense Moss is giggling about?” said Harp.

*What.*

“What?” I asked, really very confused.

“Moss bet me ten, **ten**, drachm that he could beat me at Zatrikion. The only one who ever bets against me is Pell, then Moss up and beats me in four moves!” he said with what I realized was feigned anger. The rest of the table seemed to find this pretty funny, with Moss especially pleased.

“Well, will you take my money now?” I asked, risking a smile.

“Fine,” said Harp, throwing his hands up “I’ve never had anyone fight so hard to *give* me money.”

*Maybe he’s waiting to have it out until after everyone’s gone to bed, but then you’d think that there’d be a little resentment there. It just seems like he’s joking around like always*

“That reminds me,” Said Pell, “I owe you for all the help around the forge, and Moss had been gracious enough to pay your wages so far”

“Oh, and how did that happen?” I asked with amusement, as Pell pushed across a small pouch.

“Well once he got done with me, he had the bright idea to try the little trick you taught him against Pell” Harp explained

“Maybe, but I still beat you,” Moss said, still grinning

“Well I might as well teach you all how it’s done so you don’t lose to it again, just let me get something to eat,” I motioned over one of the servers, both of them seemed to be daughters of some of the families in town. Though Sila was conspicuous by her absence.

“Alright, let me reset the board” said Harp, and he rearranged things while my food was brought over.

I explained the Scholar’s Mate to the table, which seemed to earn me some esteem from the little Zatrikion club. Most of the Zatrikion players were older village folk which meant they had some pull within the village. I’d been expecting some suspicion or xenophobia when I came here, but everyone seemed rather friendly. I wasn’t sure if that’s how they always were with visitors or if Pell and the other players had put in a good word, but so far I seemed to be accepted.

*You’d think that they’d be suspicious of a guy that claimed to be from another world*

I also showed them a few ways to counter the scholar’s mate, and went on to ask them about games that people in the village might play.

*If I am making the trip to Nimre I’m going to need money, and I’d much rather gamble for it than work for it if I need to get more along the way.*

Not only was gambling going to slow me down a lot less, but I also just generally didn’t like hard work. I could do it if I had to, I’d been helping Pell at the forge after all, I just didn’t like it. If 2 drachm a day was an average wage for a days work, then I certainly could make more than that in a night of gambling or Zatrikion. Especially since every night would be a new tavern with fresh marks, not yet out of gambling money. It just depended on the game. Purely chance based games are no good, I needed something like blackjack where I could get a net increase with the right strategy. On the other hand, if it’s something like Baccarat then I’ll need to stick to Zatrikion for earning money.

*Unless I can get Apportation working without needing words or gestures…*

They were apparently a couple of different card and dice games that people would play, but there were two that were particularly popular. There was a sort of card-based Yahtzee, and a dice game that basically amounted to ‘roll three dice, highest wins’. This actually worked out rather well for me, the skill based game used cards, and the chance based one used dice. Apportation would help much more if I was trying to fudge some die rolls, and even if I couldn’t get it working I knew a couple of ways to fiddle with dice. Hell, dice here probably aren’t that precise. I probably wouldn’t even need to fiddle with the dice to get them to favour one result over another. All I’d need to do is find some that preferred high rolls. If I made enough rolls in a night the law of averages would get me my profit most of the time.

We talked for a while more, and they ran me through the basics of Not-Zee and Moss showed me the set of dice he used for games. *Oh yeah, not precise at all, they’re hardly even cubes.* Eventually the conversation turned to the wreck of my car, still sitting belly up in the stream.

“I don’t even know how we’d move it,” said one of the other’s whose name I hadn’t learned “Even if we did move it, where would we put it?”

“Well we can probably take it apart,” I replied “Though it being smashed up will probably make that difficult. Nearly all of it can be useful in some way, even if it’s just as raw material. Did you have a chance to take a look at that piece of aluminum you cut off of it Pell?”

“Yeah it’s like tin, except lighter and softer and it melts more easily. I’m just not sure what I’d do with it.” Pell said.

“Where is it mined anyways?” asked one of the men at the table.

“Well native aluminum clusters do appear naturally, they’re just extremely rare. Rarer even than gold or platinum,” I explained, and this seemed to get the attention of the people at the table.

“You have a carriage that’s made of something more valuable than **gold?**” Moss asked, stunned.

“No, well… maybe? Most aluminum mines where I’m from actually mine bauxite ore. It’s then processed into raw aluminum and then they make carriages or drinking containers out of it. Bauxite can be found in large quantities, and aluminum is very simple to recycle. Reforge it as much as you like and it’s still just as good the thousandth time. Both those things make it very inexpensive, I don’t know off the top of my head but I think it’s the least expensive metal you can buy. At least where I’m from.”

“How do you process the ore?” Asked Pell, thoughtful.

“Again, I don’t know off the top of my head but I’m fairly sure that it’s mostly a matter of heat. Aluminum has a low melting point, but to get it from the bauxite takes way more, way more even than what it takes to make steel”

“So it is valuable then,” said Moss “since no one else can get any.”

“Well,” I hedged “That assumes anyone wants it. Pell and I will probably need to trade outside the valley to make any money off of it,” I looked to Pell “I guess we could try making some jewelry or trinkets? We’d probably need to find someone that already knows what aluminum is if we want to sell it to them.”

“I have some tools for fine detail work, why don’t we go take a look day after tomorrow.” Pell said, sitting back in his chair, taking a sip from his mug.

“Say, this’ll be the first feast day that’s been hosted here since you arrived Quinn,” Harp said, changing the subject. “You could show us all the dances from your homeland.”

*Oh fuck, oh fuck fuck fuck.*

“Uh, well we don’t really have this sort of thing in Canada.”

*The one downside to not getting thrown out on my ass, they still expect me to show up and dance, sing, play music, or whatever it is they do at these things. Maybe I can get into another car crash between now and then?*

“Well I’m sure Sila will be able to show you around, it’s great fun for everyone. Do you play any music? I’m sure we could find an instrument for you somewhere in town”

*So he’s not spoken to Sila then*

“I’m afraid not,” I said, with feigned disappointment.

Through sheer force of will I managed to get the conversation into less dangerous territory and we sat and chatted for a while. I stuck around and helped Pell clean up, I wanted to give him a chance to talk to me privately if I’d misjudged the situation, but he just said goodnight and went off to bed.

-----

I brushed my teeth with a willow twig, and washed up with cold water. I hadn’t had a proper shower or bath since the crash but I still washed every day. The others seemed to think this was somewhat excessive but I was used to a different standard of hygiene. At least the others didn’t smell too much. I heated up some water to shave with, and looked down at my folding knife. I had read somewhere that you could extend the life of a razor just by running it along the leg of your jeans. Something about it brushing away imperfections? I had no idea how that was supposed to help, but I’d been doing it with the folding knife and it was still sharp enough to shave with. I’m not really a beard guy so I try to shave as often as possible.

I was just putting out the lantern on my table when I heard a creak from the hall. There was a light tap on the door and I pulled it open. There was Sila standing there in her nightgown, her huge brown eyes a little red from crying.

*I am such an asshole.*

“Hi Sila,” I said quietly, stepping back from the door.

She stepped inside, and looked around a little awkwardly before sitting down in the chair by my desk.

“I’m sorry Sila, I should have been more careful”

“More careful? You mean that you should have been more careful letting me think for a even second that you’d be satisfied to stay here with me, instead of going to Nimre?” Sila said, keeping her voice quiet but obviously very upset.

*Yeah, exactly that*

“I’m sorry, it was selfish of me. I’m sorry I hurt you so badly”

“Can’t it be enough? In the spring when the traders start coming through we could send for some books on magic, I heard what you said about the aluminum, we could afford it” she pleaded with me.

“Sila,” I sighed, she wasn’t wrong “How long does an elf live for? And how old are you and your father?”

“Elves live for three or four hundred years, I’m sixteen and Pappa is almost 160, why does it matter?”

*Sixteen, good fucking job Quinn*

“In Canada the average life expectancy for men is 86. And that’s with all sorts of medical advances to lengthen a person’s lifespan. Here it’s probably going to be more like 65. I’m 22. I’m already a third of the way though my life Sila. I’m also not going to age nearly as gracefully as your father has. If he was human I’d think that he was in his thirties. 40 years from now you’ll still be young and beautiful and I’ll be an old man, another ten years after that and I’ll be dead and buried.”

Sila choked out a sob, “What? That’s not fair, I-” she buried her face in her hands

*Made her cry. Again.*

“Like I said Sila, I’m sorry.” My stomach wrenched watching her cry like that, knowing that this whole thing was entirely my fault.

She took a little time and calmed down. She wiped her eyes on the sleeve of her nightgown and looked up at me.

“Sorry,” I whispered, at a loss for words.

“What am I supposed to do Quinn? Anthior is going to be here tomorrow and he’s going to try to put his stupid hands on me again.”

“Wait, what? Who’s Anthior?”

“Auntie Crisa had been taking me to see him on feast days, she’s been trying to set us up together. Except I hate Anthior, he’s cruel and greasy and he tries to grab me whenever he gets the chance. He’s also the only other man in the whole valley that isn’t either too old or already promised to someone else.”

“And that’s why Auntie expects you to marry him,” I said, finally understanding “I wouldn’t want to spend a couple centuries with someone like that either.”

“Yes,” she said quietly, “Couldn’t you just… pretend? At least when we’re hosting feast days?”

“Sila,” I sighed *This is a terrible idea* “Isn’t that going to cause you some trouble once I leave? I’ll be going on my way come early spring. You and Anthior will still be here, and you’ll be left without an alternative. I’m not saying you should marry him, if he’s an asshole then he’s an asshole, but what will you do instead? People might get ideas if we seem close, and then I suddenly leave.”

 “A-ass-” she covered her mouth in shock but I could hear her giggle a little in the dark room “I don’t know Quinn, but I know that whatever I do I’m not going to be doing it with Anthior. Maybe we just stick together tomorrow, that should keep Anthior off of me.”

*I’ve fucked up most of this, but I can try to at least make it a bit better*

“I’m guessing that Elves don’t have children that often?” I asked, trying to put together a workable solution.

She turned a little pink “Well there’s only about one or two babies born all year in the whole valley. That’s why Auntie seems to think that its Anthior or nothing.”

“Hmmm, where’s the closest nearby city?” I asked, the plan forming.

“Colos is supposed to be a couple days south of the valley, it’s supposed to have nearly ten thousand people,” said Sila in a voice that suggested that she thought that ten thousand was a lot of people “but how would I ever find a husband there? I’m just a silly village girl, what kind of dowry could Harp offer to a man from the city?”

*Dowry, right. I’ll add feminism to my list of things this world needs*

“Don’t sell yourself short Sila, I lived in a city quite a lot larger and you still caught my eye.,” I reassured her, and she smiled a little sadly, “As for the dowry, well you could say that Harp deserves some… salvage, yeah, salvage rights on my Subaru.”

“Salvage? Subaru?”

“Salvage is a maritime term. Basically it means that Harp is owed a share of my vessel’s total value since he helped me, and Subaru is just the name of the company that built my carriage. Assuming Pell and I can get some people interested in our aluminum goods, we’re going to need to sell it somewhere. I don’t think we’d do much business if everyone was trying to get to the village, we’ll need to set up shop in Colos. We will need some people to help with the shop, people that Pell will know he can trust,” I said, looking at her pointedly

“Me? I wouldn’t even know what to do, and I’d have to leave Pappa and the tavern. I don’t know Quinn…” she trailed off, seeming unsure

“You’ll do fine, you’d do the same thing you do here for Harp. You already know your numbers and you’re polite and honest, just keep being you. There’s another benefit, if we can get this aluminum thing working then the shop is going to draw a lot of customers, and not just from within Colos. I bet people will travel just to see some of the rarest jewellery money can buy. And who will be the first person they see when they walk in? You won’t have to settle for the first man with a heartbeat, you’ll be able to pick for yourself.”

“You know, I did already pick for myself,” she said, in a whisper.

“I’m sorry Sila,” I said, letting out a long breath.

She came and sat down next to me on the bed, leaning against me.

“Thank you Quinn, for helping me figure this out I mean,”

I put my arm around her and we sat there for a while, before she got up and went to bed.

-----

I lay there, staring up at the ceiling unable to sleep. My back was aching, and I couldn’t stop thinking about Sila. I felt like the world’s biggest asshole. I had worked out a path to victory, and had tried to patch things up and salvage her feelings, but I still felt like a bastard. A better man would have taken her suggestion, sell the aluminum, buy the books. A better man would have waited the four years until the next time the school was taking more students, and brought Sila with him. A better man wouldn’t have cast around for something to convince her we weren’t compatible. A better man wouldn’t bribe her to go away so he could start learning magic a bit sooner.

*Yup, I’m an irredeemable son of a bitch. But at least I’ll be a mage.*

I lit the lantern with the striker on my Zippo and opened up ‘An Introduction to Practical Magic’ to the section on Apportation. I continued reading where I’d left off, memorizing the symbols it detailed. The book contained a couple different memorization exercises, though from what I understood I didn’t need to use these specific exercises to memorize the spell. It was the actual memorization that mattered, not the process of memorization. This meant I could draw upon some more advanced techniques than what was detailed in the book, just like I’d done with the meditation. No real person is going to be able to assemble a Sherlock style ‘memory palace’, but the concept had some foundation in reality. Learn how to design clever mnemonics and you could get pretty far without needing to hallucinate words hovering in the air. Some people had better memory than others, mine is probably pretty far to the right on the bell curve, but anyone could learn to augment their memory with a surprisingly small amount of practice.

In practical terms, this meant that by about midnight I was satisfied enough with my memorization of the symbols to try casting the spell. I didn’t have a wand or a staff *oh I’ll show you* **my** *staff* so I opted for the two handed gestures, with about a one sentence incantation. *I’m going to need to memorize the gestures and incantations too.* I sat up in bed and shook a loonie out of my wallet and onto the bed in front of me. *Moment of truth.* I made the gestures and whispered the incantation.

It rose off the bed and into the air.

*Well, there it is. I was expecting some incredible epiphany, but I feel kinda underwhelmed.*

I could direct it pretty much as I wanted. I could rotate or move it in three dimensions, and it seemed fairly precise. I experimented with moving the coin around. Imagining the spell as an invisible hand or pair of hands seemed to work well, and I could be about as precise as I could if I was trying to move something with my actual hands. I tried giving some more specific ‘instructions’ to the spell, but it didn’t really seem like the spell was built for it. I tried to move the coin a specific number of millimetres or rotate it by a specific number of degrees but in both cases the coin’s response was to not move at all.

*Oh well, let’s see what I can do if I wanted to mess around with some dice.*

I knew I couldn’t fake a naturally tumbling die roll. Imagine trying to move around a die with your hands to make it look like it was rolled naturally, not going to happen. Instead I wanted to see if I could just tap something with the spell, rather than grab hold of it. I ‘let go’ of the coin with Apportation and picked it up with my hands. I shook it around like it was a die and then cast it onto the bed. As it spun in the air I reached out and tapped it with Apportation. The coin responded exactly like I thought it would, though the effect was somewhat unnatural looking.

*This will take some practice if I want to cheat at dice and not get caught, but this is definitely a start. Assuming I can do it without waving both hands around and speaking arcane gibberish*

I was getting somewhat tired, but I only had a few more things to try. I recast the spell multiple times, each time I did it I’d go one step less complex with either the incantations or gestures. By the time I finally went to sleep I’d found that I could get away with only the bare minimum. I could do it either wordlessly with a few finger movements or without gestures and only a couple of words which I could whisper under my breath.

Satisfied and finally tired enough to get to sleep I dozed off.

# Chapter 5

I slept in the following morning, having stayed up quite late learning and experimenting with Apportation. According to my watch it was 10am by the time I got down to the common room, Sila had seemingly spent the morning serving breakfast and she seemed in a better mood than I had left her the night before. She brought over the same breakfast I always ordered, pancakes with peanut butter and fresh fruit on the side. I would have preferred maple syrup to peanut butter but as far as I knew no one cultivated maple trees to make syrup.

During my first week in the village Pell’s wife, Phelio, had asked me what sort of breakfast food Canadians ate. She seemed to think I was a little homesick, which maybe I was. I explained pancakes and maple syrup to her, the most Canadian of breakfast food. Unfortunately she hadn’t known what maple syrup was but pancakes were pretty easy to make, they were mostly just flour, milk, and eggs. Since then pancakes had apparently become fairly popular for breakfast at the tavern. She had asked me if I’d like anything else to go along with them, and I was tempted to ask for sausages or bacon but stopped myself. I knew that they had eggs, milk, and butter which were all animal products, but in the time I’d been there I’d never seen or smelled any meat being cooked or eaten. They did have plenty of fresh fruit though, so I asked for some of that.

*Maple syrup! It’s going on the list.*

Sila took a seat next to me, the only other table of people already having been brought their food. She wore a different dress today, normally it was a faded and well-worn linen dress in light blue or light green. This one was in much better condition, the hem was still a little ragged, but it was a perfect sky blue and had little yellow flowers on it. It was probably the nicest dress she owned.

“Fair warning Sila, I’m a terrible dancer. I can’t vouch for the safety of your toes,” I said seriously.

This got a little smile out of her “That’s okay, I’ve never been very good either. We don’t need to dance if you don’t want to. I thought you might like to go see what some of the people from the other villages have brought to trade since you’ve been through all the books in town already.”

“That’s not a bad idea, though I do still want to take a look at the couple of books Pell picked up from the gnome trader that came through.”

We chatted for a while as I at my food, and I was just finishing up as I heard the bell over the front door ring behind me. I could see Sila’s face grow much more serious as she looked past me at who came in.

*Foolish Quinn, no proper hero sits with his back to a door*

I twisted around in my chair to see that four boys about Sila’s age or a little older had come in. Anthior and three minions?

“Anthior is the doughy one,” I heard Sila whisper behind me.

The description fit rather well. Of the four he was the palest and most plump, the other three having the same sort of fitness I’d seen from the other boys old enough to start working the fields. They were lightly tanned, and while they weren’t muscular they were all rather trim. Even Anthior wasn’t that unfit, compared to most Comp Sci students at U of T he was about average, but when compared to people that worked for a living the slight chunkiness was obvious. This was compounded by his weak jaw, roundish face, and bowl cut. Most elves I’d seen were all sharp lines and elegant curves. Anthior’s face was just curves, and there wasn’t anything elegant about it. He was dressed in a shirt and trousers like the other three. His were nicer though and they didn’t have the same long worn and faded look that the other boys’ clothes had. I also noticed that he had a small dagger in a sheath on his belt, though his friends were unarmed.

The other three had hair like the rest of the men I’d seen, long but pulled back into a tail. Two of the three were probably brothers, and all were somewhat unremarkable. Blonde hair, brown eyes, lightly tanned and with the normal sharp look I’d been used to with elves. Anthior was probably the youngest at 16 or so, the older brother was maybe 18 or 19.

“Sila,” barked Anthior in a voice too loud for the cosy room “Go get us some breakfast, barley bread, figs, and eggs”

“Phelio’s already gone out to enjoy the feast day, I’m sure you can get some food from one of the tents,” said Sila in a quiet voice.

*I suppose it is a feast day after all, feasting is probably involved in some way.*

“How’d he get his breakfast then?” He said, jabbing his finger at me.

“I made it for him,” said Sila, confidence growing.

*That was rather nice of her, I didn’t know Phelio had already left.*

“You’re Quinn aren’t you,” he said, his ire directed at me now.

*Oh here we go.*

“You’d better stay away from her, you know she’s already promised to me don’t you?” he said in cocky voice.

“THAT’S NOT TRUE!” shouted Sila, “You’re an ugly greasy pig and I hate you.”

*Ah shit*

I heard one of the people sitting at another table get up and say something meant to defuse the situation. I didn’t quite hear what was said, and apparently neither did Anthior. He rushed towards Sila who was mostly behind me. I stood up, hands spread apart.

“Now just a moment,” I said in a reasonable tone.

Anthior did halt his charge when I first stood, suddenly discovering that I was most of a foot and a half taller than him, but I think he didn’t want to seem weak in front of his friends. He reached up and grabbed me by the front of my shirt.

Now I am by no means a skilled fighter, and I’m not that muscular either. To stay fit I tend to do a lot of cardio, biking, running, walking, that sort of thing. It does mean I cut a pretty good figure when my shirt’s off, but that’s more a matter of having 1% body fat and less about being super buff. I have some advantages though, foremost of which is my pretty incredible reach. I’m a tall guy compared to normal humans, and compared to elves the difference is immense. My other advantage was the same as always, better access to information and teachers. I never spent a whole lot of time learning how to fight, but like most things I’d made sure to learn a few tricks. It’s surprising how much of an advantage it is just to know how to throw a punch properly. Most school fights you’ll see two people swing at each other a whole lot, and at the end they’ll only be scuffed up, maybe one ends up with a bloody nose. But if you knew how to punch, using not just your arm but your legs and hips as well you had a massive advantage. Against someone who knew what they were doing I was boned. But against someone who didn’t, which accounted for 90% of the people that would go and start a fight like this, I was fairly confident.

Anthior’s other hand swung way back, as if he was trying to get something out of his back pocket, and I’m sure he thought it made him look cool in front of his friends. With my left hand I grabbed the hand holding the front of my shirt. As he brought his hand back to nail me in the face I jabbed forwards hard with my other hand against the shoulder he was punching with, and I leaned my head back. Instead of hitting me in the face he just brushed against my right shoulder, all the while I hadn’t let go of his other hand. I stepped forwards and jabbed him in the face with my right, no big telegraphing wave to the people behind me, just a short quick jab to the face. He tried to get away, but I still had his other hand and my much greater reach meant that he was out of luck. I jabbed him a couple more times in the face as I saw his friends come to the realization that they should probably be helping.

I let go of Anthior and he stumbled back onto his ass, hands to his bloodly nose. The three rushed forwards, middle one slowed down trying to get around Anthior. Whether I knew how to throw a punch or not, three on one were not odds that I liked. I knew what to do though, even if it was only academically. The solution was to reduce the number of opponents as quickly as possible, choose one and hit him as hard and as fast as possible before someone grabs you from behind. I took a step towards the one on the left, briefly cut off from his pals by Anthior who was in the way of the other two. I swung with all the strength I had, legs, hips, back, and arms. I briefly considered going for the throat but I didn’t want to kill anyone by accident so I settled on the face again. He put his hands up, but too slowly. His attention had been split, he was paying nearly as much attention to me as he was to his two friends to make sure they were charging along with him. I drove him right in the face and he went right down beside Anthior, a lot more blood coming from his nose than Anthior’s.

*Broken nose, whoops.*

That left me with two, which was a somewhat more manageable fight if you could position yourself well. I stepped to the left of the boy I’d just taken down, putting him between myself and the other two. This also left the boy who’d previously been on the far right directly behind middle guy. Middle guy got tripped up trying to step over his downed friend. *I think I just thrashed his younger brother, I think he might be mad at me.* He took a swing at me but didn’t quite have his feet planted and there was no power behind it. I took the hit on my left shoulder and grabbed his arm with my left. With my other hand I repeated the Anti-Anthior strategy and hit him repeatedly in the face until he stumbled on his younger brother who was still on the ground. The last minion had seen what had happened to his friends and adopted a different strategy. He made sure to step around everyone on the ground and then charged at me, trying to grab me with both hands.

Now this was actually fairly clever, I’m decent at striking if I’m fighting someone as equally unskilled as myself. I’m much worse in a grapple though, longer arms meaning I can’t properly apply my strength. I didn’t know any clever manoeuvres for a grapple either. I got pushed back into one of the wooden pillars that held up the ceiling, and while the strikes I was taking were rather ineffectual, they were all to the gut which was really not a good place to get hit after having eaten half a dozen pancakes not minutes before. I finally managed to push him off me and to the right, causing him to stumble backwards into a table, when saw Anthior out of the corner of my eye. Too late, Anthior had already pulled out his dagger and he slashed me across my left side. I felt the pain and sickening heat of the wound, and I might have let out a very unmanly yelp of pain. Getting a knife in the ribs tends to break up the whole 'clinical chess master shtick'. Getting stabbed was a new experience for me, and I looked up at Anthior in shock.

Anthior froze, and he looked almost as stunned as I was.

Finally one of the men I’d seen at the other table grabbed Anthior from behind and shook him.

“ANTHIOR ATOS POLEPHO,” thundered the man, “WHAT HAS POSSESED YOU TO DRAW A BLADE AGAINST THIS MAN?”

*Ah, this would be the Baron*

I pressed a hand to my side, trying to staunch the bleeding. I bit back a pained gasp, trying to focus.

“Sila is promised to me, and this man,” Anthior half shouted, half whined while stabbing a finger at me accusingly, “is making a whore out of her!”

Sila started to say something loud and mostly incoherent, she was mad as hell, but I cut her off. “**Enough!** You’re Baron Polepho I take it? I’m willing to call things even, knife wounds included, if your son apologizes to Sila and agrees to stay away from her in the future,” it took an effort to keep my voice from cracking, and hopefully I managed to disguise the fact that I was barely keeping it together.

The other boys were picking themselves up from the ground and the rest of the Baron’s posse tended to them and sat them down at one of the tables. The Baron hauled Anthior around behind him, tearing the knife from his hand and speaking quietly but forcefully. Sila ran to the bar to get a rag, and I pressed it to my side. The cut started at the bottom of my left pectoral, and curved down, ending on my back just above my left hip bone.

“I-I… What do I do?” she stammered.

“It’s alright, go get someone,” I told her as calmly as possible, and she nodded and ran out the front door.

The Baron finished the angry whispers to his son and pushed him forwards.

“Mister Quinn, I am very sorry for my behaviour just now. I beg your forgiveness and promise not to bother Sila anymore,” said Anthior, head down but eyes angry.

*Lamest ‘sorry-I-stabbed-you’ apology ever*

“I accept your apology, now if someone could grab some of the whiskey Harp keeps behind the bar and a pot of water I’d really appreciate it,” I got a funny look from the Baron and his men, but one of them went to do as I’d asked while I took a seat next to the fire. The things were brought over and I set the pot of water over the fire and waited for it to boil.

It didn’t take long for Sila to return with Phelio, but by the time she was laying out her medieval first aid kit on a nearby table, the rag was mostly soaked through with blood. Phelio took out a curved needle and some thread, and turned towards me.

“Hold on,” I said, “Put the needle and the thread into the pot, and wash your hands first”

“Now Quinn, if you think for a second-” she started to say indignantly.

*Add germ theory to the list Quinn*

I cut her off “Just do it!” I said, probably too loudly.

She was a little taken aback, but she did as I said. The needle and thread went in the pot which had started to boil, and she washed her hands. I don’t think she was really following proper decontamination procedure but it was better than nothing. Sila washed her hands as well, intent to help, and they both came back over. Phelio fished the needle and thread out of the pot with a spoon that I’d left in for that purpose and moved to pull the rag away. Sila stood by waiting to help, eyes wide with worry.

“Just a moment,” I said, grabbing the bottle of whiskey from where it sat on the table.

The whiskey wasn’t quite as strong as I would have liked, but it probably had a high enough alcohol content to do the trick. I pulled the rag away and it adhered slightly to my skin, sticky with blood, but the cut had mostly stopped bleeding. I ripped the cork out of the bottle with my teeth and poured out the whiskey over the wound. I inhaled sharply as the alcohol ran down my side. One I was satisfied I nodded to Phelio, not trusting myself to speak. Sila pressed the wound together and Phelio set to work stitching it up as I did my best to be stoic and manly about the whole process. It was all well and good to have an academic knowledge of what to do in a situation like this, but no book or website really did a good job of explaining just how much it hurt. I set the bottle on the mantle as they worked, leaving a bloody handprint on the label. With Sila’s help Phelio was thankfully pretty quick about getting the wound closed, and I could finally breathe without it coming out as a gasp.

I took a look at my hands, finally noticing the pain in my right hand. Both palms were bloody, but the knuckles on my right hand were cut up and I was pretty sure I had a fracture in that hand. I’d probably cut them on someone’s teeth. That was the one downside to going for the face. People think that boxers and MMA fighters wear the gloves to protect their opponents. In fact they’re there to protect the hands from the sorts of fractures and cuts I’d manage to collect in the short fight.

I relaxed back into the chair, and looked up to see Harp, Pell, and some others from the town looking at me sitting by the fire. They all seemed pretty surprised. I was sitting there shirtless and bloody with a long line of stiches down my side. Sila was standing there seemingly in shock, her hands were bloody and she’d also gotten some on the front of her feast day dress and on her face where she’s evidently brushed her hair aside with her hand. Phelio was somewhat more collected but had also gotten blood on her hands and dress. We all looked at each other for a silent moment before I broke the silence.

“So,” I said blithely, trying not to let the pain creep into my voice, “How much do I owe you for the whiskey?”

“For the love of,” Harp started, taken aback, “Quinn, what happened here?”

“Well I think you should ask Baron Polepho about that,” I said, nodding to the Baron who Harp hadn’t noticed when he’d first come in.

I couldn’t tell if Baron Polepho was glad or irritated that I’d left the responsibility of explaining the situation to the gathering crowd inside the tavern, but I figured that I’d rather know the Baron’s position ahead of time before giving my own account of events.

“My son felt slighted by your daughter, and stepped forwards to chastise her,” the Baron began to explain.

*Chastise, oh is that what he was going to do?*

“Quinn interceded between the two of them and my son attempted to strike Quinn. Quinn, my son, and his friends fought. At the end my son drew a knife and slashed Quinn across the side while he was contending with one of the others,” he explained, loudly enough to be heard by all those that had pushed into the tavern, “I had gotten up from my breakfast by this point and managed to restrain my son.”

*I guess he doesn’t want to go into detail about how badly I kicked their asses.*

Harp looked over at me questioningly. I nodded, “That’s how it happened, the Baron and I have also already come to an agreement settling the situation.”

The Baron nodded, and I could see something in the way he was looking at me. *Kinda disappointing actually. I was expecting a ferocious outburst not a reasonable, if face saving, response.*

“If you wish to discuss this further Mister Harp, might I suggest some privacy?” said the Baron, tilting his head towards the crowd clustered around the door.

Harp shooed the people out of the tavern and looked over at Sila, concern clear in his eyes.

“It’s my blood not hers, we’ll be fine,” I said, nodding towards the Baron.

Harp went over to speak to the Baron while the Baron’s men tended to the injuries I’d inflicted on the four boys. Sila had boiled another rag, *she picked up on that quickly,* and helped me clean up. She was very gentle, careful around the gash and with my damaged hand. I got her to splash a little of the whiskey over the knuckles on the one hand and Phelio wrapped it up. Phelio also wrapped a bandage around my chest, covering the gash in my side. The two women helped each other clean up before Sila went off to change out of her bloodied dress.

The Baron approached the two of us, and Phelio retreated. Harp had apparently finished his conversation with the Baron and gone to check on his daughter. I looked him in the eye, and waited for him to speak. I like to think I looked pretty good sitting there. Despite the daylight the windows in the tavern were small, and so it was rather dim. I was stripped to the waist, wearing only blue jeans, and I was lit by the flickering light of the fire next to me. He was quiet, and it seemed like he was waiting for me to say something. I didn’t oblige him and eventually he spoke.

“I appreciate your assistance in resolving this incident quickly.”

“Neither of us stands to gain anything by drawing it out, and I’m satisfied as long as Anthior keeps to the agreement.”

“I take it then that you’ve decided to marry the girl yourself?”

“Nope,” I said, matter-of-factly, “I’m leaving for Nimre as soon as the mountains are clear enough to travel through.”

The Baron blinked. “Oh, and why would you do that?” he said slowly “Nimre is quite some distance from here.”

“Why does anyone travel long distances to Nimre,” I asked, raising my eyebrows.

“Is that so?” He said, thinking, “Why the fight then? Why insist that Anthior stay away if you don’t want her, and then why bargain away your one piece of leverage to no profit for yourself?”

“The fight? That was because I wasn’t about to allow Anthior to strike Sila, whether I want her or not some things just aren’t done. As for Anthior staying away from Sila, it’s not a question of whether I want her or not, it’s whether Sila wants Anthior or not. She’s made it clear to me that she’s not interested in him.”

“Interested or not, sometimes people must compromise their individual desires in favour of their duty to their family. Sila’s aunt Crisa has certain expectations of her, and Misses Crisa has made certain promises to us.”

“I’ve been told before that I can be a rather uncompromising person. Crisa should have considered whether Sila would be inclined to cooperate before making any promises. Has Harp made you any such promises? I’ve seen him around the village plenty, I’ve yet to meet Sila’s aunt.

“Perhaps these matters are handled differently where you come from, but here it is traditional for the mother to have the marriages of her daughters arranged by the time the daughters reach marrying age. With the death of Sila’s mother that responsibility falls to Sila’s aunt. This was something arranged nearly two years ago to be conducted once they both came of age. My son’s sixteenth birthday was several months ago, and only Sila’s lack of cooperation has postponed the marriage. I had hoped that the date of the marriage could be announced today, to be carried out next time I host a feast day.”

“You are quite right, they are handled differently. For me it is a straightforward matter, Sila does not want to marry Anthior, therefore she doesn’t have to marry Anthior.”

“That is rather a simplistic view of things, while such a viewpoint might seem sensible to a common man such as yourself,” he said ‘common man’ as if it was a slight against me, “I must take a rather more complex view of matters, I will go to some lengths to ensure that my family is provided for. That includes providing a suitable bride,”

*Oh, I think he’s threatening me,* I stood. The Baron was not easily intimidated, but despite his lack of obvious reaction I hoped that I made some impression.

“There are what, twelve houses in town? Four other villages, let’s say 12 houses in each of them as well. Maybe some have a little more, or a little less, but on average let’s call it 12. That gives us 60 houses in the villages of the valley. Say, 2 adults per house, that’s 120 people spread between the villages. There’s the farms too to consider, it’s just a guess, but I’d put your urbanization rate at about 20%. That means another 480 persons living in the countryside of the valley on farms. So all told, there are probably about 600 people in the whole valley, am I right?” I asked, still speaking quietly enough not to be heard by anyone else.

The Baron hesitated, and I could see from his expression that I’d gotten fairly close, “Your point?”

“My point is that in the city I’m from, Toronto, there are individual buildings that hold more people than this valley. I respect you Baron Polepho, but I do not fear you. You asked about leverage? There is one other thing I’ll need aside from Anthior’s continued non-interference with Sila.”

“And that is?” he asked calmly, though the situation was getting a little tense.

“A map, or collection of maps, so I can plan my route to Nimre.”

He raised an eyebrow, “And after you’ve left…?” he asked, trailing off.

“No, you can’t possibly be suggesting that you might not hold up the deal once I’d left, say it isn’t so,” I said with feigned shock, “Baron Polepho, by the time I leave either Sila will have a suitable alternative, or you can go ahead and try to strong-arm her into the marriage. Is that an acceptable compromise?”

The Baron didn’t seem sure what to make of this, “You are aware that there are no alternatives in the village, or even the whole valley?”

“If you find the deal unacceptable then we can reach an alternative arrangement,” I said, as graciously as possible.

“If that’s the deal you want to make, then I’ll have some suitable maps delivered here. Now excuse me, I must see to my son.”

The baron went off to check on his son, and I went upstairs to get my other shirt, having ruined the one I’d had on when I got slashed. At least I hadn’t been wearing my hoodie at the time, I only had one of those and I’d need it for the journey to Nimre. As I was walking back upstairs I heard some shouting in Sila’s room, and saw Harp come back down the stairs with a warning expression. Despite this warning, I was thinking of taking a look in before I’d realized that I was still not wearing a shirt.

*Probably not the best idea to step into her room with whoever she was arguing with while half naked.*

I got my spare shirt, now my only shirt, out of the dresser and pulled it over my head. I could still hear shouting, it sounded like just one voice, and it wasn’t Sila’s. The door to her room was open a crack, and I pushed it the rest of the way open and stepped inside. I could see Sila sitting on her bed, bloody dress clutched to her chest, wearing only a linen shift. She had her head bowed and seemed to be doing her best to endure the verbal abuse. The small older woman that had been shouting, *Auntie Crisa I presume?* stopped suddenly at the sound of the door opening, and she opened her mouth to say something indignant about men barging into ladies rooms while they were changing.

“You’re Sila’s Aunt Crisa?” I asked, pointing at her rudely.

“Yes,” she said angrily. She was about to continue her tirade but I cut her off.

“Get out.” I said calmly, jabbing a thumb over my shoulder.

“What? You Barge-“

“Get out!” I said, loudly enough to startle her. “Out!”

She left in a huff, chin up, trying to do her best to look down her nose at me. She did not succeed, the one and a half foot difference in height made it rather difficult. I let out a long breath, and looked over at Sila.

“What was she going on about?” I asked, bleary eyed and tired, as I leaned against the doorframe.

The adrenaline rush had worn off, I hadn’t gotten a whole lot of sleep last night despite sleeping in, and it’s surprising how tired even a short fight will make you.

“I told her that I wasn’t going to marry Anthior, no matter what. She didn’t like that.”

“Well, she’ll just have to deal with it. And I’m sorry ruining your dress,” I said, nodding at the dress still clutched to her chest.

“Don’t be silly it’s not your fault, and I can get the blood out of it. I just can’t believe what Anthior did, and you! That was amazing, I’ve never seen anything like what you did,” she said, standing up and touching my side gently, “Even after Anthior slashed you, you were so calm. I was mostly useless, all I could do was run off and get Phelio. Are you gonna be alright? That was such a nasty wound, what if it gets infected?”

It looked like she was trying to decide whether or not to wrap her arms around me. *That’s over and done with Quinn.*

“I’ll be fine Sila, that’s what the business about the whiskey and the boiling water was about. Cleaning the wound site and the needle and thread like that should prevent any infection. I’ll just need to keep it clean and I’ll be fine. Besides,” I said, “it worked out in the end. Sure I got cut up, but now you’ve got a promise from Anthior to leave you alone and I’ll have the maps I need to plan my trip.”

*And it gives me a very good excuse to get out of dancing.*

“Trip, right,” she said sadly, her arm dropping away from my side.

“Why don’t you put something on before your father comes up here to find me in his daughter’s room while she’s changing?” I said, trying to avoid a repeat of the incident under the oak tree.

“Alright,” she said, stepping back, “I, um-”

“I’ll be in my room,” I said reassuringly.

-----

I flopped back on the bed, and stared up at the ceiling. *Hey, maybe if I milk this I can get out of the more menial work with Pell. Now there’s an idea.* I rolled over and looked at ‘An Introduction to Practical Magic’ which was sitting on one of the side tables. It was just out of reach, and I really didn’t want to start moving around again. *Well I can do this whole magic thing.* I cast Apportation with a whispered word and pulled the book into my hand. I also pulled out my notepad and pen from where I kept them in my pocket.

*I’m going to need some things for my trip to Nimre, and before that I need to get my affairs in order here in Essens*

First is what can be done with the car, that’s step 1. The body is pretty much entirely Aluminum, which if we spin this right will be very valuable. I’ll need to get Pell started with working the stuff before I leave. The battery could be useful for electroplating if it’s still intact. I guess I could try to charge my phone off of it, but the voltages would be all wrong. If it’s not intact then I guess it still is about 5lbs of lead and whatever acid didn’t leak out. Alternator too could be useful for power generation if it still works. Rubber on the tires could be useful, nearest source of natural rubber is going to be the jungle, which could be very far away from here. We could also strip the tread off the tires ‘Dies the Fire’ style and use it for making the soles of shoes. The rims are all alloys, *what the hell sort of alloy?* which might be useful, unless they have too high a melting point to work with. The space saver in the trunk though uses a steel rim I think? Again, melting point becomes the issue. Frame of the car might also be steel, the car is old enough for the frame to be separate I think. Springs and shocks could be useful, assuming they’re not bent up from the crash and multiple rolls. Seats are full of that weird orangey-beige foam stuff. I bet that could make a very warm blanket. The upholstery could be used for clothes I guess? Same can be said for the floor carpeting, or we can just use it for actual carpeting. There’s also the registration and user manual in the glove box, I guess that’s some more paper for my notes. Though it’s all been written on already, maybe I can figure something out for that. Snow brush in the trunk, maybe Pell can do something with it. There’s going to be about a mile of copper wire running through the car, maybe even some bits of gold in the computer. The copper wire will be useful if I want to play with electricity, and the gold has obvious value without needing to explain what the hell aluminum is to anyone.

I looked up from my note taking, I could hear Sila and Harp talking in her room.

Step two is figure out what the hell I’ll need to cross a mountain range and most of a continent. Well the first thing I’d need is a proper accounting of the distances involved. I still had no idea what kind of pace I needed to set. Aside from that I need, water, food, shelter, and proper clothing for the weather I’ll be facing. Money as well, since it can get me most of those things. For money I could bring some aluminum, and save up the wages Pell is giving me. It’s not like there’s a whole lot to spend it on anyway, and aluminum is light. I also need to get the hang of Not-Zee and refine my dice cheating technique. I guess I’ll also need dice. Actually, I bet I could make myself some aluminum dice. That would give me something else to sell if I needed to. On the topic of aluminum, I should get the mage stone set into a ring, an aluminum ring would be pretty easy to make.

I pulled out the mage stone, I hadn’t actually tried to light it up since the first time I’d used it. I’d been keeping it in my wallet’s coin pouch until now. I tried clearing my mind and pushing my Will into it again, skipping any sort of meditation this time. I wanted to see how much work it actually took to light it up. It was fairly easy, and the stone lit as soon as I put any weight behind my though to make it light up. I didn’t get the unbearable heat or blinding light, but it was probably a bit brighter than a candle. *I guess once the mage switch is flipped it stays flipped.* I could feel a slight exertion as I left the light lit. It was a very odd sensation, it wasn’t a physical exertion, it felt more like I was concentrating on answering a math problem. I put it away, adding ‘aluminum mage ring’ to my list.

Water, food, and shelter are going to depend a lot on whether or not I can just pay for everything. If this place is anything like medieval Europe then there should be a town every 8 to 12 hours of walking distance. That is some distance apart, but it’s also close enough that a traveler isn’t spending most nights in a tent. I can fill my canteen with quite a lot of water, I didn’t even go through all of it on my hike. Food, well I’ve got that MRE which is one proper meal. I could stretch it to last a day if I needed to, it was a three course meal. It would also keep for basically eternity and was in a waterproof package, I’d save it for emergencies. Pemmican should be my normal camping food, it can also keep for a long damn time and actually tastes pretty good. It’s also pretty good for calories per pound. Native Americans knew what they were doing apparently. I will need some meat and animal fat though, and I still don’t know if these elves butcher any of their farm animals. Shelter, well I could make a tarp out of the carpets from the Subaru. They were made of synthetic fibres and were built specifically to be sturdy. Throw that over a branch with one end propped up on a tree and I had an instant tent. I could use a second carpet-tarp for the groundsheet. I could even see about making an aluminum pot to boil water with on the road. It would be light and I’d be able to sell it if I needed to.

Proper clothing was mostly covered already, I had just been on my way back from a hike after all. I had my hiking shoes, they were Gore-Tex and were quite possibly the sturdiest pair of shoes on the entire planet at this point. I picked them up from where I’d kicked them off, using Apportation again to get used to using the spell, and looked them over. They were in very good nick, all the stitching was in good shape, the soles weren’t worn down. They’d last me to Nimre and further if I took good care of them, and they’d keep my feet dry the whole way there. I had the hoodie still, and between it and the coat I might be covered for even winter weather in this part of the world. I’d gotten a sort of Mediterranean vibe from the place, despite being up in the mountains, and assuming I waited out winter the two would probably have me covered for any cold or wet weather. The coat wasn’t Gore-Tex like my shoes, but it had some sort of aqua-phobic coating and would keep the rain off. I was somewhat worried about the hoodie though, it was very soft. I might end up wearing through the elbows if I had it on the whole way to Nimre, but it would keep me warm either way.

Step three was arguably the most important though. I needed a weapon. Beating up four village boys was one thing, but I might run into bandits or other ne'er-do-wells on the road. I might even get myself in trouble if I wasn’t careful at dice or cards. Hell, I didn’t even need to cheat, I might just piss someone off enough by winning enough. I can be an arrogant prick sometimes. It wouldn’t be enough to know how to throw a punch and position myself correctly, if I did run into a bandit they’d know what the hell they were doing, and know better than me. Maybe a gun, but that might go very poorly. I probably could put together a musket or a pistol or two over the winter, but anything I made was going to be a bitch to reload. That assumed it didn’t blow up in my hand, and that I could carry enough powder. *Functionally a musket would be a lot like a crossbow.* Thing was, I knew how to use a crossbow, or even a standard bow. That was more to my liking, and I could make arrows in the field if I really needed to. I might even be able to just buy them if I found a fletcher. A bow was probably the way to do it, since reload time would be a problem with a crossbow.

I’d also need some sort of backup weapon, a bow would work at fairly close range but it was risky. An axe of some sort would probably do the trick. When I had to build a melee fighter for an RPG, I always preferred wizards, I pretty much always picked something with reach. A halberd was my favourite, but any polearm would do. My problem was concealability, I had a sneaking suspicion that a giant with a 6 foot halberd slung on his back might be the object of some suspicion. Local laws might prohibit me from carrying weapons that were meant for military use. An axe though could work quite well, either a hatchet which I might need anyway for chopping wood, or a felling axe. The felling axe would also give me pretty good reach, and the hatchet could sit in my bag if I was somewhere that took issue with even basic weapons. Even with the felling axe, I could get the axe head off and throw it in my bag if I really needed to. It wouldn’t be too hard to make a new haft later down the line.

*I do like to play the Archer after all.*

# Chapter 6

I was still scribbling notes on what I’d need for the trip when I heard a knock at the door.

“Come in,” I said, expecting Sila.

Instead it was Harp who stepped through the door, and he seemed angry about something, “What’s this Sila and the Baron are telling me about you leaving?”

*Ah shit, here we go*

“The Baron said that you two had worked out a deal and as part of it you had to leave? When I asked Sila about it she seemed to know, but told me to ask you,” he continued.

I could see Sila standing shyly in the doorway behind her father.

“Sorry, I just didn’t know what to say,” she said.

“It’s fine Sila, I understand,” I picked up ‘An Introduction to Practical Magic’ from where it sat on the bed and held it in my lap, and looked down at it. “I bought this book from the trader that passed through here yesterday. It details how to find out if someone is able to use magic, and also teaches a few spells. As it turns out, I’m a mage. I’ve even learned one of the spells from the book already. It also tells of a magical school in Nimre, and how you get admitted. I need to leave some time in the spring to make it there for the next admittance period. The one after that is in another four years. The deal wasn’t for me to leave, though the Baron might be framing it that way to save face. The deal is for him to have some maps sent over so I can plan my trip.”

I looked up at Harp, and it seemed like he didn’t know what to believe “Boy, are you sure about this? Magic? You yourself seemed sceptical about it, and now you’re going to travel across the world on the word of a book?”

*Third time he’s called me boy*

I spoke the words to Apportation and lifted the book from my hands, and sent it hovering towards him. “I was sceptical of the book too, even as I bought it. But the results are clear to see. If it was right about magic, it’s a small thing to believe it when it says there’s a school in Nimre dedicated to teaching it. Especially since the Baron seemed to know what I was talking about.”

He brushed at the book with his hand, in a way that suggested he though his hand ought to pass right through it. Instead the book dropped to the ground as soon as he touched it. *Wasn’t expecting that.* He jumped back, looking down at the book.

“And the Baron isn’t forcing you to leave?” he asked, still unsure, anger dying away.

“No, I guess that’s what he’s going to tell people to save face, but I’m leaving of my own accord,” I explained.

“Well, I guess there’s that then,” he said, “I’d thought the Baron had threatened you or something. He’s got no business throwing people out of my town,” he paused, and seemed to gather his thoughts “You’re really doing this? Who else have you told already?”

“Sila was the first to know, I also told the Baron since I wanted the maps from him, and now you know.” I said, “I’d planned to tell Pell today since I’ve been helping him with the forge.”

“Well,” he said, quietly, “We’ll be sad to see you go.” Sila, who was still standing behind him turned her face away when he said this.

*No kidding.*

“I do plan to leave things better than when I started though,” I said, trying to brighten the mood, “I want to get Pell set up to work with iron at the very least, that alone should give Essens a leg up on things. The other thing I want to do is get some aluminum goods made for sale outside the valley. Done right this could bring in a lot of money for the village. Between the two I’ll have hopefully paid my debt to you for helping me.”

“Oh, that was nothing,” he said immediately, picking up the fallen book, “It was just the right thing to do.”

“All the same though, I appreciate it. I’ve got a couple months, and that should be enough to do what I’m planning.”

“Well,” he said, handing me back the book, “I ought to let you rest.”

Harp left, leaving me alone with Sila again. She slipped into the room and sat in the chair at my desk.

“I’m sorry you won’t get the chance to go and dance Quinn, thank you again for protecting me though,” she said quietly, with less of the energy that she’d had when I talked to her in her room.

*I’m not sorry.*

“It’s alright Sila, you can still show me around the rest of the festival if you want. I don’t want to bust open the stitches dancing but I can walk around a bit,” I said, trying to be open minded about this whole ‘festival’ thing.

“No, it’s okay Quinn. Everyone would be looking at us or asking questions. I just want to be left alone right now,” she said.

*I can certainly get behind that sentiment.*

“I hope I didn’t complicate matters for you Sila, if Harp heard it from the Baron I take it that the Baron isn’t being quiet about me leaving?”

“I don’t know, I haven’t been back downstairs since I came up to change. But it seems like something he’d do, just mention it here or there and let it get around. Especially if he could make it seem like you leaving was his idea. It’s not fair, you’re leaving because you want to, not because he’s kicking you out.”

“It’s fine Sila,” I said, sighing, “It would have been very easy for things to get complicated if the Baron forced the issue. As long as he holds to our deal in private he can say whatever he wants in public.”

Sila sighed, wrapping her arms around herself and drawing her knees up to her chest, “I get it, it’s just not fair.”

*Do I ask her for help with testing Apportation? Magic might be a rather sore spot for her.*

“Um, is there anything I can do to help with, that?” she said hesitantly, gesturing vaguely at the book held in my hands.

I looked down at the book, “Sure, I was actually wondering why the book dropped as soon as Harp touched it. I couldn’t just pick it back up again either, I lost the spell entirely once Harp touched the book,”

“Maybe the spell doesn’t work on things held by other people? Here, try sending it over to me and I’ll grab it.”

“Alright,” I said, nodding.

I cast the spell and sent the book on its way over to Sila, and she reached out and grabbed it. Just like with Harp, as soon as she touched the book I lost the spell entirely. I didn’t just lose my grip on the book with my Apportation ‘hands’, the spell as a whole collapsed.

“It happened again that time, I’m going to try to take the book from you, let me know if you feel me tugging on it,” I said. Sila seemed excited, even doing something so mundane as this.

*Well I suppose it is* ***magic*** *I was also pretty thrilled with the concept being real.*

I cast the spell again, trying to take it from Sila. I felt some sort of resistance when I did it, and the spell failed.

“Feel anything?” I asked, I’d definitely felt something.

“No, I guess it didn’t work?” she said, unsure.

“I have an idea, I’ll try that again.”

I cast the spell again, this time putting some Will behind it like I had with the Mage Stone. I felt the same resistance as before, but this time it felt like the spell was pushing through it instead of folding immediately. It took only an instant and I was through, and I could tell that I had the book in my ‘grip’.

“Feel anything?” I asked, not yet exerting any force on the book.

“No, am I doing something wrong Quinn?”

“You’re doing fine Sila, what about now?” I asked, giving the book a tug.

It seemed to startle her and she jumped a little, loosening her grip on the book enough for it to slip free of her hands.

“Oh, it worked! Why wasn’t it working before?” She asked, surprised but also excited.

“I think that if I want to interact with something someone else is holding I actually need to make an effort to get the spell to work. I’ve got a couple more things to try, do you mind?” I asked, already adding more tests to my mental list.

“Sure,” she said, as she got up from the chair and sat down on the bed next to me. *Proceed very carefully Quinn.* “I don’t really want to go out right now anyway. Anthior has other friends and they’ll probably want to impress Anthior by pushing me around or trying to start another fight with you.”

“Sorry about that,” I said, feeling slightly short sighted. Even if Anthior was kept away from Sila, she still had to live here.

“It’s okay, it’s worth it just to keep Anthior away,” she giggled, “And to see the way you beat him and the rest of his little gang.”

“Well, if I run into people like Anthior on the road they’re probably going to be much better armed. I’m trying to figure out if any of the spells in this book,” I said, lifting the book, “can be used to protect myself. That’s why I’m doing the testing.”

She nodded, suddenly serious, and maybe a little concerned, “Okay, what do you want to try next?”

I spent some more time with Sila testing out some theories I had on just how Apportation would work when interacting with another person. Hopefully the ‘rules’ for Apportation would carry over to the other spells in the book. It wasn’t just Apportation I was trying to get a handle on, but magic in general.

The first thing I tried once I knew I could actually effect another person was whether or not someone could ‘harden’ their defences against someone using magic on them. So I got Sila to focus very hard on not letting me take the book, and then I tried the spell again. I still managed to get through her, *Will, I guess?* but it was noticeably more difficult. We repeated that a couple times and it got a little harder each time to take the book. I wasn’t sure if that was me wearing out, or Sila getting better, but I hadn’t felt a drain even after casting the spell so many times. I’d felt the pressure when trying to get through Sila’s will, but not any drain when actually casting the spell. *I hope that I’ve actually got tons of mana, and that I’m not one spell away from dropping dead due to mana-exertion. Maybe I’m recovering my mana as fast as I spend it? I do a hell of a lot of cardio after all, my endurance and recuperation time are pretty good when it comes to physical tasks. Maybe that carries over to magic? But that doesn’t seem very in-theme to me.* I was fairly sure that the effects I was seeing were due to Sila actually putting up additional defences on top of the apperantly passive defence that anyone had, so I moved on.

The second test was basically the opposite of the first, I wanted to see if Sila could let me take the book. It looked like she could, I had her focus on letting me have the book, and I didn’t feel any resistance when trying to take it from her.

I’d wanted to test my magic-railgun idea but that didn’t really seem feasible today. The fair was on, people were everywhere and it would be hard to find a quiet spot outside. And if it did work I might end up drawing attention if it did work and the projectile went supersonic. So instead I came up with an alternative that could be tested safely indoors. Rather than throw something at an attacker, I’d pick up the attacker. Sila couldn’t be more than 100lbs, and was probably more like 90lbs. That came to 9 or 10 mana. Granted, I had no clue how much mana I had, but I figured I’d give it a shot.

It didn’t work. At all.

I tried again, using both hands to gesture and speaking the longer incantation. I think I frightened Sila a little with the display, but nothing happened. I didn’t feel any resistance from Sila, actually I didn’t feel anything at all. When I usually cast the spell I could feel something like a little ‘pop’, and I could tell that I had the spell active. When I lost a spell I could also feel a little ‘pop’ and I’d know that something had ended the spell. It was a hard feeling to describe, it was almost like a barely noticeable hum in a quiet room. You’d notice it when it first turned on, but you’d become accustomed to it quickly and it would fade into the background. Then you’d notice it again when it disappeared, the sudden silence very different from what you’d been hearing a moment ago. But when I tried to lift Sila I didn’t get anything, no ‘noise’, no resistance, nothing. It just didn’t work.

*So I guess I’ve got between 1 and 9 mana.*

“Is something wrong Quinn?” asked Sila, still a little unnerved by my big swoopy hand motions and then the extended silence as I consulted my notes.

“I’m trying to get an idea of how much mana I have, that’s what the book calls a Mage’s magic reserve,” I explained, “I apparently don’t have enough to lift you up, the spell just isn’t working.”

“Well, I’m not a Mage,” she trailed off, unsure. I nodded, encouraging her to continue, “Well couldn’t you try to only lift me up a little bit? Like only use a little bit of mana and see what happens?”

*That’s a good idea.*

“That’s a good idea,” I said, “let me know if you feel anything.”

I gave it another attempt, this time using only as much power into it as I put into lifting the book. *Where to put my hands? The hand Quinn, the hand.*

“Oh!” Sila exclaimed, holding up her left hand, “I felt that, are you able to pick me up now?”

“I’ll try, let me know if it hurts and I’ll stop right away.”

“Okay,” she said, nodding. She seemed a bit more relaxed now that I wasn’t chanting and making weird hand gestures.

I slowly increased the upward pressure until I hit the upper limit of what the spell could do, and I could see Sila being pulled up and to the side as her hand lifted up. She didn’t seem to be trying to fight it either physically, or with her Will.

“Sila, can you try to pull your arm back down?”

“Okay,” she said, this time clearly exerting herself, “It’s hard, like I’m pushing down on an overstuffed chest.”

I could feel the pressure against the spell, and while it didn’t fail she was able to get her hand back down. *Even if she is only 90 or 100 pounds, 10 pounds of force is not too much trouble when gravity is on your side.* I let go of the spell, and definitely felt the ‘pop’ as it ended.

“Anything else?” she asked, still seeming eager to help with my magical research.

I did have some more ideas, though they mainly focused around trying to get some idea of my mana capacity. I didn’t really want to keep manhandling Sila to do that.

“I think we’re fine for now,” I said, stretching and letting out a large yawn, “I do have some ideas more tests, but those will need to be done outside. Do you know if Pell left any of the new books downstairs?”

“I’ll go check,” she said, hopping up, “You stay here, you need your rest.”

I raised my hands in defeat, she scurried out of the room and I could hear her pitter-patter down the stairs. She came up a while later with one of the books.

“Here, I don’t recognize the cover, this is a new one right?” She asked, still unsure.

“’Enmelos and the Beetle’,” I read, “Yeah, this is a new one.”

“Um,” she started, unsure, “Would you read it to me?” There was another awkward hesitation, “It’s just there’s not a whole lot to do.”

*Be careful Quinn.*

“Sure,” I said, finding myself a more comfortable position.

It was early afternoon when she finished helping me with my tests, and I read to her until long after we both should have gone to bed.

# Chapter 7

As it turned out I was right about my injury getting me out of work for a couple days. Pell and I had planned to start stripping the car a day or two after the feast day festivities, but Pell had insisted that I rest. It’s always nice when people cooperate with my plans to slack off. This gave me a few more days to experiment with Apportation and to learn the other spells in the book. Sila also had some free time now that the last big feast day before winter was over. There wasn’t going to be any more traffic from outside of the valley, and as winter came closer people traveled between the villages much less frequently. This abundance of free time on her part meant that she’d decided to appoint herself as my assistant and had insisted on helping with my experiments.

I had two tests in mind for today, the first test was to get a specific figure for my mana capacity, and the second was to see if I’d be able to use Apportation to protect myself. *Small stones would work in a pinch, but I bet I could make some lead bullets at Pell’s forge.*

“What are we trying first Quinn?” Sila asked as we were finishing a late breakfast.

The first test was fairly simple, especially since Apportation seemed to have a linear cost progression. All I needed was an accurate estimate of the weight I was trying to lift. Unfortunately Essens was rather short on weight sets and the only scales I knew of were the merchant scales that Harp kept behind the bar. There was plenty of water though, which was nearly as good. Water, conveniently, weighs exactly 1kg per litre. Harp did have a few 1 and 2 gallon jugs, with each gallon being roughly 4.54 litres. Convert 4.54 litres to pounds and you’d get almost exactly 10lbs.

“I want to get an idea of how much mana I have, my plan for that is pretty simple, I’ll just see how much weight I can lift with my telekinesis spell. It takes 1 mana per 10lbs. I know that I’ve got at least 1 mana because I can cast the spell at all, but it can’t be more than 9 or 10 since I wasn’t able to lift you up when I tried. My experiment should tell me where I fall in that range,” I explained.

“Oh, and how much do you think I weigh?” she asked, in a tone that made me realize that I’d just ventured into very dangerous territory.

“Nint- Eighty five pounds?” I said, hesitantly.

“I guess that’s fair,” she said with a small self-satisfied smile, “what are you going to try instead? We buy things for the tavern by weight, but it’s never really very precise. Sacks of potatoes maybe?”

“Water, 1 gallon of water weighs almost exactly 10lbs. I count the number of gallons I can lift and that’s my total mana reserve. I just need to go down to the pump to fill up some of Harp’s jugs.”

“Oh, I can do that,” she said hopping up.

“Now hold on a second,” I said, my natural inclination towards chivalry overruling my desire to avoid work as much as possible.

“You sit down,” she said tersely, “I already fetch water all the time for Pappa, and you’ll break open those stitches.”

I raised my hands in defeat, “Alright, alright, but for now just get the one 2 gallon jug. I’m going to need to rest between attempts anyway, and there’s no point in you exhausting yourself if I only end up needing a couple of jugs.”

“Fine,” she said, seeming pleased with her victory, “I’ll bring it to the back room.”

“Oh I don’t know, are you going to tackle me if I try to get up?” I asked, “It’s an awfully long way to walk, I don’t know if-“

She swatted me on the shoulder and went off to fill the jug.

-----

I had my little spellbook open and was flipping through the symbols for Light when Sila pushed open the back door, carrying the large jug. I stood up to give her a hand, she was breathing heavily and her hair was sticking to her sweaty face.

“You sit down,” she said forcefully, “I can do this Quinn.”

She heaved the jug onto the table next to the one gallon jug I’d snagged from behind the bar, and collapsed into a chair across from me.

“That’s perfect, thanks Sila,” I said, feeling guilty. Whatever Sila might say about the stitches, the jug wouldn’t have been any trouble for me, but it weighed nearly a quarter of what Sila did. I was pretty sure Sila knew that as well. She’d been doing her best to impress me and make herself useful, and I’d been doing my best not to let on that I’d been appreciating her attention.

I hauled the jug across the table to sit in front of me, and glanced up at Sila. She was looking at me with that look again, the same one I’d first seen when I finally got my glasses back, but she cast her eyes down as soon as she saw me notice.

*Dammit Quinn.*

I sat there for a moment, quiet, looking down at the book on the table next to the jug. Without looking up, I motioned Sila over, “Come here Sila,”

I didn’t look up, but I saw her out of the corner of my eye as she walked around the table to stand next to me. I reached out and slipped an arm around her waist, pulling her close. She didn’t need much prompting, she slipped her arms around my neck and rested her chin on my head. We were both quiet for quite a while, me siting, her standing next to me, arms around eachother.

“Thank you Sila.”

“You’re welcome Quinn.”

“I still have to go.”

“I know.”

After a while Sila straightened a little, and seemed to consider returning to her seat. Instead she sat across my lap, resting her head against my shoulder.

“What now?” she asked, nodding towards the jug and the book.

I slipped my arm around her back to steady her, “Well I guess I cast the spell”

I made the gestures with my free hand, and cast the spell to lift up the jug.

Or at least I tried to. It didn’t work.

Sila looked up at me, question clear in her huge brown eyes.

“It didn’t work. I didn’t feel any resistance, I didn’t feel anything at all. It’s the same as when I tried to pick you up. The spell just failed altogether. One moment,” I said, and I cast the spell again, this time to lift the one gallon jug.

This time it worked just fine, I could pick it up and make it float around. I set the jug back down.

“So I can pick up a 1 gallon jug, which is 1 mana. But I can’t pick up at 2 gallon jug, which is 2 mana. Do I only have 1 mana?” I asked, as much to Sila as to myself.

She slipped her arm behind my back, “Could you try casting the spell twice? Combine the spells to pick up the jug?”

“Makes sense, I’ll try again in a bit though. I want to make sure I’ve fully recovered my mana before I try this again. No point in doing this if I end up with the wrong figures at the end.”

“It must come back pretty quickly though, right?” She asked, “We spent lots of time yesterday trying things, and you kept casting it over and over.”

“That’s true,” I said, nuzzling her curly brown hair with my nose, “But something is keeping me from putting any more power into the spell. It seems odd that I’d only have the one mana, there must be something else I’m missing here.”

“I’m sure you’ll get it Quinn.”

We sat quietly for a bit, and then I tried the spell again. This time though I cast the lower powered version of the spell twice, imagining each copy of the spell as a single hand. This did work, and I moved the hands to grab the handle of the jug. As soon as the two ‘hands’ got anywhere close to eachother I felt a disruption, I tried to keep the spells from collapsing but I just couldn’t hold them. I tried again immediately, getting two more copies. *So I can’t cast a spell for two mana, but I can cast four spells for one mana in quick succession?* I gave it another try, keeping the hands on opposite sides of the jug, but as soon as the hands got within a metre of eachother I could feel the disruption. By the time they were within half a metre the disruption was overwhelming and I lost the spell again. I tried a few more times, trying to do a better job of holding the spells, but it just wouldn’t work. I took off my glasses and set them on the table. I rubbed at my eyes with my free hand and leaned back in my chair.

“None of this makes any sense. Either I’m doing something badly wrong, or I’m the magical equivalent of a tiny Asian karate master.”

“Tiny Asian what?” Asked Sila, clearly very confused.

“Ah, well according to the Mage stone I’ve got a lot of talent, we both saw that. I can also memorize one of these spells fairly quickly. But on the other hand I might only have one mana, so magically speaking I’m talented but very weak. Though it looks like the one mana I do have is recovered nearly immediately. I just don’t know, maybe I’m doing something wrong with Apportation.”

She leaned up and gave me a reassuring peck on the cheek, “Well then what about the other spells in the book?”

“Yeah, I’ll need to learn Light. Apportation might be failing due to something about the stuff I’m trying to lift, but Light’s result should be entirely independent. I’ll just need to sit down and study the spell for a few hours.”

“What about the other test in the mean time? You said you wanted to use Apportation to protect yourself, how would that work?” she asked, picking up my glasses from the table.

Sila had been asking more questions recently, asking me to explain what I was doing and how I was doing it. She might have been genuinely interested, but I was pretty sure the main reason for all the questions was that she’d realized how much I enjoyed having someone to explain my ideas to. Especially when that someone was quite pretty and liked to sit in my lap.

“Well Apportation is designed to pick up something weighing 10lbs, and hold it there for sixty seconds. That’s actually quite a lot of energy, my plan is to use that energy in a much shorter time frame to throw something small and dense. Probably lead or steel balls, though stones would do in a pinch.”

She stopped with my glasses halfway to her face, “So like a magic bow then?”

I blinked. *Damn, exactly like that.*

She thwacked me on the chest, “Why do you look so surprised. You’re trying to do the same thing that a bow does, it’s a way to turn strength that’s normally used over a long period, and use it all at once.”

I smiled, catching her hand in mine, “I’m just impressed, you’re pretty clever to make connections like that.”

“You don’t need to say things just to make me feel good Quinn, I know I’m not as smart as someone who’s gone to as much school as you have,” she said, taking her hand away and putting on my glasses.

“Don’t sell yourself short. Education is not the same as intelligence, you might not be educated but don’t think that you’re not intelligent. Ah, Sila, are you alright?”

“Everything is so blurry, I it’s giving me a headache,” she said, squinting and blinking a lot.

I gently took the glasses from her face, and slipped them back on.

“Is that what it’s like for you without them?” She asked, rubbing at her eyes.

“Not quite, but it should give you a rough idea of how bad my vision is.”

I rather liked the look of Sila when she was wearing my glasses.

“Oh!” She exclaimed, hand held to her mouth, concern clear in her voice, “What if they break? There’s no way that anyone in the valley could ever make something like this.”

“Trust me, the thought has occurred to me. Without them I’m mostly blind, and it’s only a matter of time before something happens to them, no matter how careful I am. I’m hoping that I can find something in Nimre to solve the problem. Either some spell to fix the glasses if they break, or hopefully a spell to correct my vision permanently.”

“I’ll miss you Quinn,” she said sadly.

*Foot, meet mouth. Maybe find other ways to bring up your plans to leave at every oppritunity.*

I sighed, “I know.”

I could tell that there was a question she wanted to ask, *Probably something along the lines of ‘will you come back?’*, but she didn’t seem to find the nerve. Instead she got up after a moment.

“Why don’t I put together a picnic for the two of us, we can try the other test out under your tree,” she said, changing the subject.

“Alright, just as long as I have your permission. The tree is awfully fa- Alright, alright!“ I said, laughing and fending off the vicious slaps.

-----

Sila and I walked up the hill towards the old oak tree that I’d apparently been granted ownership of. It had lost many of its leaves, and they were spread across the hilltop. It looked like the tree was ablaze, scattering glowing embers across the hillside. Sila laid down the blanket she’d brought along with the basket, again she’d insisted that she be the one to carry everything, and we sat down. I’d collected a few roundish stones on our walk out of the village, and I spread them out on the blanket before me. Sila set out the lunch she’d prepared for the two of us, and I got to work trying to abuse the limits of Apportation.

I failed miserably.

Sila did her best to cheer me up while I was grappling with the spell. She snuggled up next to me and fed me tasty food, but I just could not get Apportation to throw the stones any faster or further than I could by hand. I stood up, despite Sila’s protests, and tried walking around to see what would happen. From what I could tell Apportation moved the object relative to my body, just as if I was holding it with my hand, but this discovery didn’t really solve my problem. I could wind up for the throw with a bit of a run, just like I could if I was going to throw it by hand. Unfortunately it was also about as effective as doing it by hand. I was not going to scare off crusty old bandits by pitching rocks at them.

I looked over at Sila, who was still sitting on the blanket. She was looking at me like she thought that I’d absolutely lost my mind. In fairness, I probably looked pretty goofy. I was a giant by the standards of anyone in the valley, and I was running back and forth across the hilltop throwing rocks and swearing.

“It’s not working,” I said, as I threw myself down on the blanket and looked up at the sky, “It turns out that this whole magic thing is kinda difficult. I can’t get the stones moving any faster than a strong man could throw them.”

“Oh, I know!” She said excitedly, “You could throw spears or knives, just like Enmelos!”

“Well sure but that’s something I can do already. I’m pretty sure I can throw something nearly as fast by hand as I can with the spell. I might as well just bring along a bow. Throwing knives are all well and good in stories but aren’t very effective in real life, and spears are too heavy to carry more than two or three.”

Sila didn’t say anything, and I twisted around to look at her. She was sitting with her legs pulled up to her chest and her arms wrapped around her knees, eyes downcast.

*Good job Quinn, snap at your only friend on probably the entire planet and make her feel foolish for saying anything.*

“I’m sorry Sila, I didn’t mean it like that. I’m just frustrated, and I shouldn’t be taking it out on you.”

“It’s alright Quinn,” she said, “What about the other spells? Couldn’t you do something with them?”

“I don’t think so. If I’m right I’ve only got the one mana. The only other spell I might be able to use for defence is Ignite, but for 1 mana the only thing I can light is tinder. So I can throw either rocks or matches. Neither is really going to be very effective.”

“Are you sure you’re going to be safe? I know you mentioned bringing the bow, but it’s an awfully long way to travel. I worry about you, what if you run into bandits or slavers on the road?”

“Slavers? Pardon me?” *Because this was too easy already.*

“I heard one of the Baron’s men talking to Moss before, in Adympia they capture travelers and make them work on their farms or in the mines. I think even one or two of the people living in the valley are runaway slaves.”

“And Adympia is the kingdom right over the mountains isn’t it?” *Fantastic.* “What about to the south? Do you think I could find passage on a ship to Nimre? Or at least one to get me past Adympia?”

“I don’t know Quinn, I guess? The capital of Rhona is supposed to be on the sea, I bet they’d have lots of ships.”

“That might be the way to do it then,” I said thoughtfully, “The pass south will clear well before the pass north, and a ship is going to get me there much faster than walking. I might even be able to make it through the pass south now, even with the snow that’s already fallen in the mountains.”

“What?” Sila asked, voice a little higher than normal.

“Don’t worry,” I said quickly “I’m not leaving yet Sila. I’ve still got plans for Pell’s forge, and that will last me into midwinter at least. But if I can find a boat headed to Nimre I’ll have a lot more room for error. I don’t want to arrive in Nimre, only to find out that I’m a few days late and need to wait four more years before I can get in.”

I picked myself up of the ground, and sat back down with my back against the tree.

“Come on, sit down. I’m going to teach myself Light and I require your assistance.”

“Okay, but how am I going to be able to help? I don’t know anything about magic,” she said, as she sat down next to me.

She took a seat next to me and I wrapped and arm around her.

“You task is actually the most important,” I explained seriously, “Your task is to provide moral support so I don’t tear my hair out trying memorize the spell.”

Sila giggled a little, and I set to work learning the spell.

*This isn’t so bad, is it?*

# Chapter 8

The days went by excruciatingly slowly as I waited for the pass south to clear. From what I’d found out from the Baron’s maps and speaking with some of the better traveled folk in the village I might have been waiting until early summer if I’d tried going north. Not only was that about a month after the acceptance deadline in Nimre, it would have also driven me crazy, sitting there in the village bored out of my mind. As it was, waiting for the beginning of spring was bad enough. According to my watch I’d spent nearly 150 days in the village by the time that I left for Nimre, and the last 120 or so had been some of the most boring days of my life. In the first month spent in the village I’d read every book, learnt all the spells, and run every experiment I could think of. I continued to test things with the spells just to entertain myself, but I quickly discovered that the spells were incredibly limited in what they could do. My additional experiments were really only slight variations on what I’d tried before, and they hadn’t taught me anything new.

I spent many days working with Pell in the forge trying to reinvent some of the modern crafting methods I was familiar with. I’d like to think that I did a pretty good job, but it was astounding how much time everything took. I basically knew which ideas would work and what wouldn’t work by the end of the first month, but actually implementing those ideas took ages. I eventually got him working with iron but to do it we’d needed to rebuild the entire forge. *I can see why everyone spends so much time drinking and gambling at the tavern, there’s nothing else to do here. Simple life? To hell with that.*

We’d spent a couple of weeks stripping the car of everything even slightly useful. Every single scrap of aluminum was melted down and made into ingots which were stacked in a shed behind Pell’s forge. We’d tried aluminum pots, but it didn’t really work, they required a lot of careful handling to ensure they didn’t just melt on the fire. We had much more luck with jewellery and trinkets, I even made myself a few sets of aluminum dice. We gave thermite a shot, but we both realized quickly that it wasn’t really feasible. Not only was is a waste of aluminum, but getting enough iron oxide together was a slow and tedious process especially since it wasn’t till midwinter that the forge was ready for making iron. Even if we were willing to spend the time and materials, thermite has such a high ignition point that it wasn’t really possible to light it outside of the forge.

We’d pulled apart the engine, which was in really terrible shape. The battery was cracked and smashed open, Pell salvaged some of the lead, but nearly all of the acid had all leaked out onto the ground. The alternator had fared a similar fate, the wires and coils were recoverable but it wasn’t ever going to work again. I did hit the tree head on at highway speed, so most of the engine was under the front seats and smashed to pieces. We got some use out of the tires by partnering with the Baron’s cobbler, apparently the only proper cobbler in the whole valley. We stripped the treads off the tires and the cobbler used it to sole shoes. They weren’t as nice as what I was wearing, but they were a far sight better than anything else in the valley.

Pell and I tried to melt down the rims, but I had no idea what they were actually made of and we just couldn’t get the forge hot enough. As far as I know they still sit in his shed next to what’s left of the aluminum. Just for fun we made a siege crossbow from the car’s leaf springs. Damn it was powerful, but it wasn’t anything I’d be able to take with me on the road. It took the two of us in turns to load the thing and it weighted nearly as much as Sila. I think Pell ended up selling it to the Baron. Pell was surprised at just how much copper wiring was in the car. There probably **was** about a mile of it all together, which Pell promptly recycled. I had some dreams about power generation, but there wasn’t much I could really do in only a few months. I might have tried charging my phone, but I could just as easily have blown out the thing if I’d given it the wrong voltage or amperage. We also dug the little bits of gold out of the car’s computer, but it was such a tiny amount that it was barely worth the effort.

Some of the women in the village took the seat upholstery off our hands. I found it rather entertaining when I first saw Sila wearing my Subaru’s front seat as a dress, though she seemed a little hurt after I started laughing. I was right about the seat filler as well, I have no idea what the orange foam stuff is but the village got a couple of winter coats out of the deal. With the help of Phelio I made myself a tarp using the carpets from the Subaru. We stripped off the fuzz, just as if we were preparing a hide to be tanned, and we were basically left with a plastic sheet. I experimented with recycling the paper from the car’s manual. I wasn’t terribly impressed with the results, but it did leave me with another notebook.

But even all that work didn’t take very long. When I’d first agreed to help Pell at the forge I was interested in the idea, it was a chance to make use of the knowledge I’d gained wasting time playing Dwarf Fortress and Cataclysm, but I was also dreading the work. It turned out that I need not have bothered, there was barely any work to do once the snows started to fall. There’s only so many horses that need shoeing, and so many pots to mend. Even if the regular work week in the village was six days on, one day off, by winter it was often the opposite. I think the only thing that kept me sane was all the experimentation I was doing with bows. Unlike my magical testing I could always find something new and interesting to try and I’d often go off stomping around the woods, Sila shadowing me, as I looked for appropriate pieces of timber.

I did experiment with decurve bows, purely since I liked the idea of a bow that could be left strung all the time, but I eventually discarded the idea. They were less powerful even than the simplest straight bow, and I had come up with some very clever designs over the winter. It’s amazing what a person can do with the right tools, materials, and about a hundred straight days of mind numbing boredom.

The bow I finally came up with was monstrous, both in power and in appearance. I’d combined the techniques and designs used by half a dozen different cultures, leaving me with the Franken-bow. I’d started building it centre out, since I decided early on that I wanted an arrow shelf. It was more precise and allowed the arrow to pass through the centre line of the bow instead of being slightly offset. I’d also grown used to it from shooting modern compounds bows. From the Mongols *always the exception* I took the reflex design, and from the Native Americans the recurve design. Both were techniques to get more power out of a shorter bow, and it was possible to use both methods in a single design. For the final version of the bow I even made the trip to the north end of the valley to get my hands on both sinew and horn, making my final design a composite bow in the style of medieval China. Horn and sinew weren’t quite as good as fiberglass when it came to energy storage, but they were superior to any wood I might find. A ‘composite reflex recurve shortbow’ is a hell of a mouthful, but this was one hell of a bow. The weakest of the English longbows had at least a 100 pound draw weight, and were still 6 feet tall. I was fairly sure that I’d gotten this bow damn close to 100 pounds, and this was out of a 4ft package. The Franken-bow can probably be described as overkill, but this was also going to be my primary means of self-defence out on the road. I did also pack both a hatchet and a dagger, but those were weapons I had no experience with. A bow on the other hand? That I could use.

It took me some time to work up to the 100 pound draw weight. Before being dropped, literally, into Essens I’d had a 60 pound compound bow. Nearly doubling the strength required was quite a jump, but I’d had plenty of time to work up to it. Early on in the design process I tried my best to replicate the cams and levers of a compound bow with bits from the car, but it simply wasn’t feasible. Thankfully I’d played plenty of Age of Empires, and I knew how important it was to research thumb rings as soon as they became available. Rather than the English two fingered draw I could instead use the thumb ring to basically grab the string in my fist and use all of the strength in my hand to draw the bow. A modern quick release would probably let me use even more strength, but the thumb ring would be a great deal faster on the draw and it was something I could make with the tools available to me.

-----

It was the eve of the spring equinox, and the rain outside fell in sheets. I could hear it beating against the window shutters and crashing against the clay roof tiles. Pell, Sila, Moss, and myself were gathered around the fireplace, wood crackling and popping, preparing for the journey south. We had all of our things spread out on the floor in front of the fire, and were checking over what we’d prepared. The plan was for the four of us to travel together to Colos which was a city, at least by medieval standards, only a couple of days south of the valley. The others would stay in Colos and locate a building to set up shop in. Pell and Harp had some small amount of money stored away, and between the two of them Moss seemed confident that they’d be able to rent the space they’d need. Harp would stay in Essens to man the tavern, and instead Sila would handle her father’s share of the business. Pell would turn the aluminum into jewellery and various trinkets, and Sila would do her best to charm wealthy customers into buying Pell’s goods. Moss would be on hand to make sure that things run smoothly, since he was one of the only people in the village that had really spent any time in Colos.

If I’d set things up properly the village should see a nice influx of funds, which should make life there a little easier. Sila would be out of the Baron’s reach, and would have her pick of the merchant class’s unmarried sons. Harp should even have the money to hire on a proper apprentice to pass on his trade. From Colos, I’d continue on for another couple of days to arrive in Myra where I’d hopefully find a ship headed in the right direction that wasn’t too expensive to afford. I had been saving up though, Pell paid me two drachm a day, and Harp only charged me one. Combine that with my almost **magical** luck at dice and I had about 200 drachm saved up. Hopefully that would be enough to buy me passage if not to Nimre, at least past Adympia.

The floor in front of the fire was covered mostly in my own belongings and aluminum ingots. The others only had to plan for at most 5 days travel, while I might have to be prepared for three months on the road if my plan to hop a ship fell through. Each of them had a spare set of clothes, and enough food for a couple days. The plan was to stop just south of the pass out of the valley at an inn Moss had been to before. From there we’d continue inn-hopping, this meant that they wouldn’t need to carry much in the way of emergency rations since we’d never be more than a few hours from civilization. They each had some miscellanea, wineskins, and Harp had brought a couple of his books. Most of the weight they’d be carrying was the extra aluminum, and some of the trinkets that Harp and I had already made.

I on the other hand, had quite a sizeable inventory. I’d already planned to bring along everything I’d been keeping in my room, though I’d be leaving the jack with Pell once we got to Colos. I also had the Franken-bow, 50 iron tipped broad heads, and about a week’s worth of pemmican. The pemmican I’d prepared when I went to the north end of the valley to get materials for my bow. I also had three sets of three aluminum dice which I could either gamble with or sell. Finally I’d also made myself a rope hammock, and packed the tarp that I’d made from the Subaru’s carpeting. I’d actually given my hammock tent a test on a rainy autumn night, and it worked very well. The tarp kept the rain off, even with the autumn winds blowing the rain nearly sideways, and the hammock kept me clear of the wet ground. It was actually more comfortable than my bed in the tavern, since I’d made the hammock specifically to fit me. The beds in the tavern on the other hand were about a foot short of long enough, and the footboard was an integral part of the frame so I couldn’t remove it to make room. I’d been sleeping with my legs pulled up for months, and the chance to finally stretch out felt amazing. After that first test I actually slept outside most nights that autumn, only returning to my bed in the tavern once it became too cold.

“You really think that’s all you’ll need to get all the way to Nimre? What if you can’t find a ship? It’s quite a ways Quinn and it’s rather harsh country.” Moss said to me.

“Well you said that it’s about 8 hours between towns for a person on foot right?”, and Moss nodded at this, “Well I went over the Baron’s maps, and I’m pretty sure I can cover the same distance in 6 hours.”

“That’s quite the pace to set Quinn, you sure you can do that?” Pell said, seeming concerned and somewhat skeptical.

“When you travel to one of the Baron’s feast days, how does that trip usually go?” I asked, smiling a little.

“Well, usually we’ll leave just after breakfast and we’ll get there an hour or two before dinner. We usually sup on the road, why?” Moss supplied.

“I can get there in time to have lunch, and then be back in time for dinner,” Moss and Pell both seemed surprised at this, “And I’ve been actually doing the trip once or twice a week to keep up my endurance since I knew I’d be making the trek to Nimre.”

Sila was smiling a little, “Sila, did you know Quinn’s been doing this?” Pell asked, noticing her expression.

“Yeah, he’s been bringing the Baron some of the bows he’s been making. But why bother running yourself so hard Quinn? You always seem to want to take your time with everything, you’ll still end up sleeping in the inn overnight when you get there. Why exhaust yourself?”

I opened my mouth to speak, and then hesitated, “Are you casting aspersions on my work ethic?”

“I’m not casting anything Quinn, you’re the Mage. But you do seem kinda lazy sometimes.”

“Now I’m not agreeing with her Quinn-“ Began Pell, big stupid grin on his face.

“I helped rebuild your entire forge!” I said, a little indignantly.

“Well sure, but that doesn’t count-“

“Doesn’t count?”

“That was one of your **projects**,” and he emphasized the word, “Like making the bow. When it’s one of your projects you do nothing but eat, sleep, and work. But if it’s not one of your projects, well, you’re very leisurely.”

I raised my hands in surrender, “Fine, you win. But I’m not planning to stop to sleep at the first inn I reach every night. If I did, I wouldn’t be able to make it. It would take about 160 days at that rate, not including days lost to bad weather or other issues that might crop up on the road. I’ve got precisely 110 days starting tomorrow morning when we leave, not nearly enough. So instead I’ll stop for lunch and rest for an hour, then continue on to the next village,” Sila and the others raised their eyebrows, seeming surprised, “I’ll get there in the middle of dinner, an hour or two after the sun’s gone down. I’ll spend the day resting on feast days. Should only take me about 95 days that way, and I’ll have two weeks’ worth of room for error.”

“By the-- do you really think you can keep that pace?” Moss asked, “I’ve been through a lot of the land you’re planning on crossing Quinn, I had a hard enough time covering the distance I did in 8 hours. You want to do twice that in only 12?”

“Well the average elf can do, what, four miles an hour? From what I can tell most villages are near enough 30 miles apart, and you could cover 32 miles in eight hours so that makes sense. The average human on the other hand can do at least five, and soldiers in a forced march are expected to do six or seven. I can keep up forced march speed, so potentially I could even do 30 miles in five hours. Spending another five or six to get another 30 miles further on is not that far of a stretch.”

“But you’re going to do that for nearly a hundred days!” Sila said, and I wasn’t sure if she was worried or impressed.

“I’m not saying it’s going to be fun, in fact it’s going to be damn hard, but it’s doable. Though, I am **really** hoping that I do find a ship, even if it only gets me part of the way it’s going to make my life much easier.”

“I don’t know if there’s gonna be any passenger ships heading to Nimre, but you might find a mail carrier or cargo ship. If you can, try to find a ship owned by one of the big merchant families, they’ll usually be flying the family crest on a banner from the top of the mainmast. Most of their captains are paid by the milion, not on shares. They’ll welcome the chance to make some money on the side,” explained Moss.

I’d been picking his brain over the past several months as I’d been planning my trip. He was much better traveled than I’d first thought, and I’d been starting to think that he might have once been in the military. It wasn’t that he stood straight as a board and marched around giving orders, because he didn’t. Instead he had the sort of quiet confidence of a man that was comfortable in his own body.

Moss and I checked over all of our gear, and finally the four of us had a chance to eat dinner, and go to bed.

-----

I’d already put myself to bed and was just drifting off to sleep when I heard the door to my room open. It was absolutely pitch black. There was not a single light on in the whole of the tiny village, and the heavy cloud cover and rain blocked out any light from the moon or stars. I could hear them slip into the room, bare feet on the lightly creaking floorboards. I heard them shut the door, making very little sound, and they stepped towards the bed. I felt the mattress move slightly as they laid a small hand on it, feeling their way along. They were breathing quickly and shallowly, clearly very nervous. If not for the sound of the rain still beating against the roof and shutters I thought that I might have heard their heart hammering away. I could feel the mattress sink down, as they eased their weight onto it. I felt Sila’s small form as she laid a hand on my chest and pulled herself on top of me. I felt her lean down and touch the side of my face with a soft hand, kissing me. I raised a hand to her waist, and felt bare skin.

*Oh. I think I’m skipping a couple of bases here.*

I’d been doing my best over the winter to keep things from getting too heated between the two of us and she hadn’t kissed me, **really** kissed me, since that first time under the Oak tree. Since then she might plop herself down in my lap when the two of us were alone, but that was as far as it ever got. We both knew that we’d be separated for some indefinitely long period of time, but we were also rather alone and we enjoyed taking comfort in having someone close. I was one of the only people near her age in the whole valley, the lengthy elf generational cycle meaning that there were very few children born at the same time. And I’d been separated from everyone and everything I’d ever known, excepting the contents of one wrecked car.

The last time I’d found myself in a situation like this, things had not gone well. It had been clumsy, unsatisfying, short, and a frustratingly long time ago. The lack of internet access had added to my frustration, and I was having a hard time thinking of reasons not to just throw her lithe form down on the bed and relieve a little stress.

“mmmmphhh,” I tried to speak, though Sila was making that rather difficult.

I felt her pull the rough linen covers down to my waist, and she slipped her hands up under my shirt. I could feel her delicate nails dragging along my skin. I brought one of my hands up to her face, and pushed her gently away, giving me a chance to breath and allowing me to speak.

“Sila,” I said warningly.

“Shut up. Just shut up,” she said forcefully, and I could hear her voice quaver with both need and frustration.

She slapped my hand away, and dug her fingers into my hair, angling my head back. She kissed me hard, and with her other hand she grabbed me rather firmly between the legs.

*Alright, decision made, this is a terrible idea.*

I got my hands around both of her wrists, and I wrestled her off of me. She was careful not to make any noise to wake the few other people in the tavern, but she wriggled around and fought me until I pinned her to the bed beside me. I spoke the words to cast Light, and a cold white light illuminated the scene. I could see her huge brown eyes as they reflected the light, and her thick brown hair was spread out around her. There was both anger and hurt in those eyes, her jaw was set stubbornly and her slightly crooked teeth were bared. She was, as I thought, completely naked. She was lightly muscled from honest work helping at the tavern, but her slim form and small breasts suddenly seemed much less appealing in the cold light. It made me realize just how young she was. Even if Sila was past marrying age for elves her short stature, slim build, and flat chest made her look childlike. I felt guilty for having let my thoughts wander in this direction on more than one occasion, and the thought of continuing made me feel sick. Worse still I’d led her on to believe that this was something I wanted from her.

“Sila, we can’t do this, and especially not before I’m about to leave,” I said gently.

“Why won’t you just give me what I want?” she half pleaded, half demanded, though she stopped trying to tear herself free.

I let go of her wrists, “I can’t Sila, not when I’m about to leave, not when I think of the consequences that I might end up leaving you to deal with.”

She started to cry quietly, and sat up to bury her face in my chest. Seeing her tiny, slim, naked form clinging to my chest only made me feel worse and I put out the Light. She pulled herself together a short while later. Without a word she pulled away from me, and slipped out of the room.

*Good job Quinn, that’s one hell of a goodbye.*

-----

# Chapter 9

I woke up an hour or two before dawn, and I could still hear the rain crashing against the window shutters. I cast Light to help me navigate the small room as I prepared for the day. I shaved, not sure how often I’d be able to while out on the road. Pell and I had managed to make some fairly good straight razor blades, but even if I sharpened them with the multitool I wasn’t sure how long they’d last. Steel straight razor blades could last a long damn time, but these ones were bronze, and it wasn’t like I had a proper sharpener.

I could hear the floor creak as Moss left his room and headed down for breakfast, I followed a short time later. I came down to see Moss and Pell speaking quietly at one of the tables, and I could hear Phelio moving around in the kitchen. She had come along to see off her husband, and she’d join him in Colos once the business was in decent shape. I took a seat at the table and Phelio brought breakfast out to us before taking a seat in the chair next to her husband.

As we ate we went over our travel plans for today. We’d leave a bit before the sunrise and make our way towards Letea, the most southerly village in the valley, arriving an hour or so before dinner. I’d tried to push for a faster pace, eating lunch in Letea instead of on the road, to arrive at a small way station just on the other side of the pass leading out of the valley just before nightfall.

“Not everyone has got your super-elven endurance Quinn, and it’s going to be a hard enough to get to Letea carrying all of this,” Said Pell, gesturing at the supplies and aluminum ingots that the others were bringing along, “Without trying to sprint the whole way.”

“Alright,” I said, raising my hands in surrender.

One thing I’d noticed over the past several months was that elves seem disproportionally strong for their size. It wasn’t an ant like strength to mass ratio, but it was noticeable. Despite their slim builds and shorter stature the average elf seemed stronger than the average human. Pell was probably an above average example of elfin strength, but I was pretty sure that even Harp was a bit stronger than me, despite being more than a foot shorter and quite a bit lighter. I’d noticed rather early on though that my endurance seemed to be much higher than that of anyone I’d met so far. Even despite my laziness I could keep working at the forge far longer than Pell could, and I needed to take far fewer breaks. To some extent that was due to my heavy focus on cardio training prior to ending up here, but he seemed to have less endurance even than your average slightly pudgy office worker. If humans were persistence hunters descended from plains apes then my guess was that elves were descended from forest apes and were either ambushers or trappers. They’d be optimized for quick bursts of strength but would be unable to keep going for very long after that. Though from what I could tell the elves had stopped eating meat long ago and had restricted themselves to a mostly vegetable diet, eating only the animal products that could be taken without killing the animal.

Sila came down a little while later, dressed for travel, and she set her pack down next to her chair. The others had been so kind as to leave the chair next to me empty for Sila, and she pulled herself onto it. Phelio had already left a plate there for Sila and she ate quietly while the others chatted, clearly excited for the journey ahead. As far as I knew even Moss hadn’t been out of the valley for a while and was looking forward to traveling again. I’d realized that for the rest of the people at the table Colos was an incredible distance away, and that despite their long lifespans it was entirely possible that save for this trip they might live their entire lives in the valley. *It’s what, 90 miles from here to Colos? Less even as the crow flies. It was nearly 160 miles to get from Algonquin Park back to Toronto.*

Judging from Phelio’s expression I think that she noticed the awkwardness between Sila and I, though she didn’t say anything. I was guessing that she attributed the silence to the imminent separation of two close friends, rather than the aborted attempt to get it on. Phelio didn’t push the issue, and thankfully Moss and Pell seemed oblivious to the situation. Sila and I finished our breakfast in silence, and a short time later the lot of us gathered our things and set out for Letea.

-----

By noon it was still pretty cold and the weather hadn’t cleared, this had made me very thankful for my modern clothing and equipment. The others were wearing coats made out of a sort of coarse plant fibre and coated with some sort of plant based wax. It was fine if you were a farmer and were already ducking into your house to take frequent breaks, it was less good if you were traveling long distances without anywhere to stop to dry off and warm up. The others were already complaining of the cold when we set off, and in the time since then they’d been soaked through to the skin. I on the other hand was doing just fine. My jacket had held up through the winter and the hydrophobic coating hadn’t worn off like I feared it would. I’d already been through the whole of winter with only it and my hoodie, so a brisk spring day was no problem. My Gore-Tex shoes kept my feet dry and the only bit of me that was a little wet were the bottoms of my jeans. All the same I needed to get them dry and warm, it wasn’t cold enough for them to freeze, but hypothermia was still a risk.

I found a suitable spot on the side of the road at the crest of a hill, the ground was still rather wet but the water wasn’t going to pool here so it was about as dry as it was going to get. I pointed it out to the others, it being rather hard to hear over the pounding rain, and Moss gave me a hand stringing up my tarp. It wasn’t fantastic at keeping the water off a campsite, I’d originally designed it as a sort of one man tent, but it was waterproof and was better than nothing.

“Quinn!” Pell shouted over the rain.

“What?”

“You’re insane!” he shouted, “I thought you were going to exhaust yourself trying to get to Nimre, now I know the truth. You’ll drown long before then!”

I laughed, and it was a big belly laugh. I was glad just to be on the road, finally on my way to Nimre, finally leaving the excruciating boredom of this tiny valley. I probably had a big stupid grin on my face since I’d left the tavern, even as the others were wet and miserable from the weather and the cold.

“Back home, I did this for fun, aren’t you having fun Pell?”

“Pell’s right, you’re insane,” said Moss, barely audible over the rain.

We set up a fire, though it took some time to get the tinder to light. If I’d been able to pump more power into ignite I bet I could have gotten it blazing much more quickly, but as it was I simply cast several copies of the spell and gave the tinder a little time to dry out. I’d found out early on that I could maintain about five spells at once before I started to have difficulty, and it could be any combination of the spells I had. I could sometimes get a sixth spell going but it was tricky to hold the other five in my mind and cast the sixth, so it didn’t always work. Sometimes when it failed it would even disrupt my other spells and I’d lose one or two of the ones I already had going, so I tended to stick to five or fewer.

Pell setup his little wire stand and hung a pot over the fire. We weren’t short on water so Moss started a nice vegetable soup. We sat around the fire and ate, the hearty soup doing a lot to warm everyone up. They weren’t going to be able to dry off all the way, but the chance to rest was as refreshing psychologically as it was physically. It gave the others the energy to slog through the next dozen or so miles to Letea.

-----

We got into town a bit later than we’d planned, and I could see that the others were right at the limit of their endurance. Their eyes were a little wild, breath ragged, and they were all somewhat unsteady on their feet. I was also getting a little sore, but between the frequent breaks and slower pace I knew that when it came time to head out on my own I’d be able to keep to my schedule. I followed them through the village as they stumbled to the local tavern and when we got there Sila nearly fell through the front door into the common room. Thankfully we were expected, and there were warm baths and dry clothes waiting for us when we arrived. None of us needed to be told twice, and we made our way upstairs to the rooms that had been prepared for us.

The inn in Letea was rather nicer than I’d been expecting, I’d thought that there’d be two rooms with a couple of tubs each like Harp had at his tavern, but here they’d been brought into the individual rooms we’d be staying in for the night. I was rather glad for the privacy, back at Harp’s tavern I’d always taken my baths very late to avoid others walking in, but it wasn’t a foolproof solution. The elves didn’t seem to have the same privacy standards as I was used to, and it had been jarring in the first few weeks. The sheets also looked nicer than the ones in Essens, it wasn’t as soft as cotton might be but it was better than the linen sheets I’d gotten used to. *I suppose Letea has an easier time getting products and visitors from outside of the valley.* The tub unfortunately, like the bed, was really quite undersized for someone my height, but it didn’t matter. I luxuriated in the warmth, and I didn’t leave until well after the water had cooled to room temperature.

-----

I’d gotten dressed and just stepped out my room and into the hallway, when Sila opened the door across the hall from me. I could see that she had a bundle of dark blue cloth clutched in one hand. We hadn’t spoken to each other at all since the previous night, not at breakfast, and not on the road. She stood in the doorway to her room, long brown hair was still wet from the bath. Her jaw was set, though her huge brown eyes were looking down at the floor.

“Here,” she said quietly, holding out the bundle of cloth.

I took it, shaking it out. It was my shirt, the one I’d been wearing during the fight with Anthior and his friends all those months ago. The long gash in the side had been mended with a patch of linen, though it was a much lighter blue than the rest of the shirt. It looked like it had been stuck in place, rather than sewn. I felt inside the shirt, and could feel at another patch of linen holding the other side of the cut together. Phelio had tried to mend it for me after the fight, it was one of only two shirts I had after all, but the cotton-spandex blend didn’t really cooperate. I eventually told her not to bother, and I got myself a couple of linen shirts. I’d assumed that my shirt had been recycled in some way, though it looked like Sila had taken it and figured out a way to mend it.

“I tried to sew it back together, but the fabric just kept pulling apart,” she explained quietly, “I hope the way I did it is okay. I kept trying to dye it to match and make it look neater, but I couldn’t get the blue to be any darker than this.”

“It’s perfect Sila, thank you.” I said softly.

She looked like she was about to say something more, but decided against it. She pulled the door to her room closed and scampered off down to the common room, leaving me there holding my newly repaired shirt and feeling awful.

-----

I came downstairs for dinner after putting the shirt away, and I could hear Moss’s voice as I walked down the creaky steps.

“And the whole damned time, there’s Quinn, big stupid grin on his face stomping along like some sort of mad giant. Today was bad enough, and he says he’s gonna do twice that, every day! Ah, there he is,” he said, noticing me enter, “and he’s **still** smiling like a lunatic.”

“Aw, that’s just because I like hearing such nice things said about me. You’re Atis right?” I asked, offering my hand to the only unfamiliar face at the table.

He took it and we traded grips, “Yeah, and damn you’re a big one. What are you, part giant?”

“Human,” I said, “We’re sort of like elves, just bigger, and no pointy ears.”

“Human, that’s a new one for me. Where abouts do humans come from?” He asked, the question giving me reason to pause.

“Banestorm,” Moss supplied, “He’s on a quest to Nimre to discover the arcane secrets that will give him the power to save the world.”

*Well. I guess that’s one way to put it.*

I looked over at Moss, hands spread apart and an exasperated look on my face.

“What?” He asked, “Oh come now, I know you don’t like to brag about it but it’s the truth.”

I looked over at Atis, who had a wide-eyed expression, “He’s not telling stories?” He asked.

“It’s true, all except for the saving the world part. I’m mostly in this for myself. I’m going to try for the sort of pragmatic anti-hero though, rather than a legendary virtuous hero.”

Atis just blinked.

“It’s not that important, don’t worry about it,” I said, waving a hand, “I have a question though, it looks like you get more traffic through here than the rest of the village, am I right?”

It took him a moment to process what must have been gibberish to him, I guess antiheros weren’t really a subject of local legend, but he answered, “Yeah, yeah, both the dwarves and the city folk tend to come by here to trade. Dwarves don’t want to go too far from their mountains, and the city folk don’t want to make the trek all the way up the valley and through a second mountain pass. Come summer and Athes’s shop will be stocked with plenty of goods from both sides.”

*Greetings from the mountainhome. Your efforts are legend there. Let us trade!*

“And you’ve never seen any humans come through to see what the dwarves have left?” I asked.

“Never, never even heard the word until late last fall when Moss came by.”

“So no other humans, but there are,” I said, counting off on my fingers, “Elves, dwarves, gnomes, orcs, giants… anything else?”

“Well city folk’ll try to tell you that high elves is a different sort of elf than us,” he explained, *Hey, fantasy racism, hooray!* “and there’s some of the minor races, nymphs, dryads, goblins, that sorta thing. But there’s not a lot of them around.”

“Rhona, Adympia, and Nimre, those are all elf kingdoms right?”

“Uh,” Atis looked over at Moss.

“Yeah, it’s not till you go pretty far north that you start to find lands controlled by orcs or giants,” Moss supplied, “Adympia likes to take orc and giant slaves though, you’ll want to be careful if you end up passing through there Quinn. They might think you’re a funny coloured orc or a short giant.”

*Note to self, do not become slave.*

“What do they usually use orc or giant slaves for?” I asked, I wanted to get an idea of the risks I’d be taking if sea travel wasn’t an option.

“Well it depends, but it’s usually hard labour, sometimes they’ll offer freedom in exchange for military service though. Pretty sure most farmers in Adympia are orcs or giants,” *Manual labour, my only weakness.* “You though might catch some lordling’s eye. I hear some of them collect freaks and, sorry, I don’t mean it like that Quinn.”

“Its fine, go on,” I said, interested.

“Well some lords collect unique specimens. When there’s a Banestorm in Admypia there’s always a race between the noble houses to get men to the site to collect whatever comes though. One thing though Quinn, don’t let them know you’re a Mage, not ever. Better to work in the mines, yeah even for you,” he said, noting my expression at that last remark, “They don’t abide free Mages. I heard they even test their nobles for magic, and if they do have magic even they end up as slaves. Usually their family’ll buy them back, but that’s no life Quinn.”

“I don’t know. Enslaving someone seems about the worst thing you can do to someone. Is it that much worse to be a slave with magic?”

“Yeah, there’s rules Quinn, rights even slaves have. From what I heard a bookkeeping slave or scribe doesn’t have it that bad, even farmers and miners got a life and there’s rules on how they can be treated. Can’t break up families, can’t force yourself on any of the women slaves, can’t kill them without reason. Mages and Wizards though? There’s no rules, nobles will do as they like.” Moss said solemnly, and Atis was nodding along with an almost sick expression on his face.

“Well, I really hope I can find a ship then. I don’t want to run into an enterprising Admypian looking for a quick buck. I don’t want to try crossing the kingdom through the bush either. It would delay me far too long, and I have no idea if I’d even be able to find enough food.”

We chatted for a while longer, though Sila went up to bed early. She hadn’t said much of anything while we were talking. The rest of us played a couple games of Zatrikion, and Moss got the Scholar’s Mate off on Atis once before we all went off to bed.

# Chapter 10

Despite the nicer rooms here in Letea, I still had a hard time sleeping. Even after several months of living in the valley I hadn’t quite gotten used to sleeping in what passed for a bed here. Linen sheets and mattresses stuffed with straw were quite a downgrade from 900 thread count cotton sheets and a memory foam mattress. It was a little nicer here in Letea, the sheets were some sort of almost-cotton and the mattress seemed like they were stuffed with down, but the bed was still over a foot too short. Maybe I was being a bit of a diva, but even with all the time I’d had to get used to life in the village, sleeping was still a problem for me.

According to my watch it was 4:30 when I woke up. I tried to get back to sleep, but it just wasn’t happening. I had some time to kill, so I pulled out one of the maps the Baron gave me and cast Light a couple of times. It would be another hour and a half before the others woke so I thought I might as well do something productive. I had a couple of maps, but the ones that stretched as far as Nimre did not have the same level of detail. They’d show cities and towns of at least 1000 people, but the villages and way-stations that connected them were not shown. I could still see the main roads though and if I had to walk to Nimre I’d probably be fine if I stuck to them, at least until I got to Adympia.

The particular map I had pulled out was the one which showed the entire continent of Elardia, it looked like someone with a poor understanding of geography had tried to sketch out Europe. I was currently in the kingdom of Rhona which occupied sort of the same area as Italy. Though it looked like someone had hacked off the boot of Italy a bit above the knee, and the resulting landmass looked sort of like India had been dropped into Italy’s place. France was still there, looking roughly France shaped. Germany was somewhat recognizable as well, though it had gotten a haircut and Denmark was missing entirely. Adympia covered all of what I thought of as France, along with a decent portion of south western ‘Germany’. England and Scandinavia were gone, and eastern Europe mostly faded out into an unspecific mass. The portions of ‘Germany’ not under Adympian control, along with eastern Europe, were labeled ‘Goblinoid Tribal Lands’. *Someone mentioned Orc tribes to the north, I guess Orcs are Goblinoids?* The Spain and Portugal equivalents existed, though they’d been relocated. Instead of jutting out of the south-western corner of France, the Iberian Peninsula jutted out of the north-western corner. Nimre was roughly Portugal sized, and in about the same place. The rest of ‘Spain’ was split between two kingdoms, Karka and Ashur. Ashur was about the same size as Nimre, and was spread across the southern coast of ‘Spain’. Karka occupied the whole of the remaining portion, though that still left it smaller than Adympia.

From what I could tell though, a lot of Adympia’s land wasn’t doing a whole lot. The map didn’t show the villages, but nearly the entire northern half of what Adympia claimed seemed mostly uninhabited. Judging by the number of cities, it actually looked like Adympia wasn’t a whole lot more powerful than any of the other Kingdoms on the continent. Ashur especially seemed very urbanized, at least for a Bronze age civilization. All of the kingdoms seemed to have most of their cities along the southern coast of the continent, and the few large inland cities were all on rivers large enough to be marked on the continent scale map. Much like Classical Greece, naval power was definitely the focus here in Elardia. Though that did leave Karka as the odd man out, since its coastline was all rather northerly. I didn’t know if they were far enough north for their ports to freeze in the winter, but judging from the map that wasn’t a concern that any other kingdom had to contend with. Indeed, while the capital cities of the other kingdoms were all coastal, Karka’s was on one of the large rivers. Not only that, the river in question only reached the sea by passing through Nimre. *These guys are either going to be close allies, or they’ll be trying to kill each other constantly*

The other major difference between Elardia and Europe was the scale. On earth the trip from eastern Italy to south west Portugal couldn’t have been much more than a thousand miles. Here though the trip was more like *five* thousand miles, which was borne out both by the scale on the map, and by my estimated travel time. *Hold on a second, that means… Adympia has got to be what, the size of Russia? It’s not just five times the size of France, it’s twenty five times the size. How the hell do they keep such large kingdoms together?*

I did not have an answer, so bored with the map I pulled out the little spell book that had started me on my journey. I’d need to figure out what to do with it if I couldn’t find a ship to Nimre. Getting caught in Adympia would be bad enough, but I didn’t want to deal with whatever worse fate faced Mages that were captured and carrying around a spellbook would kind of be a giveaway. Hopefully my mage stone ring wasn’t quite as obvious, though the thought of the stone brought something to mind. I’d had to work for it to get the stone to light up, it hadn’t just lit up the second I’d touched the stone. But if what Moss said about the Adympians testing nobles for magic was true then they must have some alternative way to detect it. Otherwise the noble just wouldn’t put the required effort in, and the stone would stay dark. I’d be in really bad shape if they tested every potential slave for magic as a matter of course.

I put the spell book in an outside pocket where it would be easy to reach. If worst came to worst and I was going to get captured I’d want to be able to ditch the book before they found me with it. My notebook would need to go too since it’s full of my magical notes, such as they are.

I flipped through the book, recalling much of the testing I’d done. I’d had visions of becoming some sort of techno-mage, blasting my foes with X-Ray lasers and hyper-sonic projectiles. Unfortunately the spells were just too limited to do anything like that. I had a high school chemistry set, not a nuclear physics lab. I hadn’t been able to make sense of the symbols either. Once I’d run through all the tests to see what the spells could do I tried to test *how* the spells did what they did, but I had even less luck there. I figured that the symbols that ‘taught’ the spell must have had some sort of structure, so I tried looking for patterns or similarities. I’d guessed that Dowsing and Detect Magic might have some common themes, since one looked for magic, and the other looked for water. I was hoping for something to jump off the page, maybe a symbol that the two spells shared that I could label ‘Detect’, but I had no such luck. It wasn’t going to be as simple as taking Detect Magic or Dowsing, cutting out the reference to Magic or Water, and pasting in a bit of the Ignite spell to get a Detect Fire spell. *Trouble is, I just don’t know what I don’t know. Hell, I’ll probably sit down in ‘how to Mage, 101’ and the first class will explain what each of these symbols do and how they do them.*

I had eventually gotten some combat utility out of Apportation though. I’d tried floating knives and such, but they had so little force behind them that it was ultimately useless. I could drag the blade across someone and hope to nick an artery, but 10lbs of force is not a lot. All it would take is for someone to try to bat the knife aside and I’d lose my grip on it. It might scare people to see a man with a bunch of flying knives, but that wasn’t going to help if someone was really out for blood. Instead I’d worked out how to use Apportation to augment my archery. Apportation essentially gave me an extra set of hands, and I intended to take advantage of that. Rather than reach over my shoulder to grab a new arrow after every shot, I’d use Apportation to grab the arrow. This meant that I could leave both hands on the bow, and redraw as soon as the arrow was loosed. Not only did this bump up my rate of fire, but it was also meant that I was a bit steadier when nocking the arrow since Apportation let me do it with two hands, instead of just one.

After procrastinating for long enough I started to hear people moving around in the hallway outside my room, and I took that as my cue to go down for breakfast.

-----

It was about noon when we arrived at the pass between the mountains, and we stopped to eat before braving the pass. It had finished raining at some point last night, but the others were still having a rough time of it. Nearly all the ground we’d covered since leaving Letea had been uphill, and the rough terrain had taken its toll on the rest of the group. Their shoes left much to be desired, in fact they could only be loosely considered shoes. One downside to not using any animal parts was that you didn’t really have anything comparable to leather for shoemaking materials. They all had the tire-tread shoes that had been made after taking apart the car, but they were still very basic. My shoes had been sized properly, I had insoles, and the left and right shoes were matched to the shape of the foot. As far as I knew the shoes were either in “men’s” size or “women’s” size which meant they fit poorly, and worse than that there was no difference between right and left. Insoles were entirely out of the question, I think that they best they had was a bit of cloth padding inside the shoe.

*Yeah. I have the best shoes on the planet.*

Even with my much greater endurance, I knew that there was no way I’d be able to make the trip on foot with shoes like they were wearing. I had some general notion that you could get used to walking barefoot and have it be as comfortable as a decent pair of shoes, but it would take too long to adapt to the change. My success was going to be as much about my shoes and coat, as it was going to be about any ‘super-elven’ endurance.

Pell collapsed onto a suitable tree stump, as Moss started up a fire. Moss had been foraging as we were going along, and by the time we’d stopped he had quite the collection of vegetables. I’d not been terribly interested in learning what could and could not be eaten, I’d decided that if I got to the point where I needed to forage for food then I had bigger problems, but I’d kept an eye on what he was doing. Some of what he’d collected I could actually recognize, but the rest were roots and tubers that I would never have looked at as edible. I suppose that was one downside to having plenty of academic knowledge, but very little practical knowledge. The food was pretty decent though, I’d been expecting something awful tasting but technically good for you, and instead the roots and tubers mostly just tasted like carrots and potatoes.

“How bad is the pass going to be Moss?” Asked Pell, who had never left the valley before.

“It’s probably not too bad, there is a proper road that leads out of the valley. Parts might be washed out from the spring melt, but it should be clear most of the way now that nearly all of the snow’s melted.”

 We cleaned up after ourselves, elves could put boy scouts to shame when it came to ‘leaving nothing but footprints’, and we headed into the pass. The road was a narrow gravel strip, about wide enough for a single cart to pass. On the left rose one of the mountains that made up the border between the valley and the rest of Rhona. On the right the ground dropped away sharply to meet a river that flowed down from the mountains, fed by the melting snow. The river was flowing very quickly, and the water that wasn’t white from the rapids was brown from all the silt and grit collected from the water’s trip down the side of the mountain.

We were about an hour from the end of the pass, and two hours from our way-station when we found a rather substantial problem. It looked like the water from the melting snow or the earlier rain storm had washed out part of the road. The cliff had collapsed into the river in a wide arc leaving only a strip about a foot wide, with the rubble from the collapsed road slopping down into the river at a very steep angle.

“Well, it could be worse,” I said.

“How could it be worse? The road’s gone!” said Pell.

“I can still see a bit of road there,” Moss said, gesturing towards the narrow strip that remained, “that’s plenty of road, we’ll need to let someone in Colos know though. We won’t be getting any traders in the valley until the road is fixed.”

“I think I’ve got to go first, actually, probably best if I go last.” I said, thinking of how much I hated heights.

“Wait, what do you mean?” Asked Sila.

“Well either I go first because I’m the heaviest, and if it’s going to collapse it’s going to collapse when I cross. Or I go last because if it collapses at least no one will be stuck on the wrong side.”

“Oh I do not need to think about that right now,” said Pell.

“You’re last I think Quinn, I’ll go, then Sila, then Pell, then you,” said Moss, and he looked to the others, “Don’t take your time, don’t creep across. Just walk straight across as if we’re still just walking down the road, the less time you spend out there the better.”

Sila and Pell nodded, suddenly very serious, they seemed glad to defer to the more experienced traveler. Moss, calm as ever, took a deep breath and walked right across the ledge. Sila seemed very reluctant to cross, and Pell didn’t seem like he was in too much of a hurry either.

“Come on, you’ll be fine girl, just walk right over to me,” said Moss, motioning her over.

I could see Sila centre herself, hesitate, and then sprint across the ledge. She nearly bowled Moss over when she got to the other side, but she’d made it. Pell followed shortly after, though at a calmer pace. Then it was my turn. I’m honestly terrified of heights, but there was no way in hell I was going to let anyone else know about that, so before I could convince myself that this was a terrible idea I walked out onto the ledge.

And it was a terrible idea.

I was about halfway across, and had just put my weight down on my right foot when I felt the ground underneath start to fall away. I was committed to the step and couldn’t pull back, so I threw myself forwards with my hands outstretched. I didn’t quite have the leverage I needed as the ground fell away under me, but I managed to throw myself far enough forwards to land with my upper body on the road. I couldn’t get purchase on anything with my hands, and pushing against the rubble as it slid into the river was not helping. Sila ran forwards to try to try to help, but Moss grabbed her around the waist and hauled her back. Right before the cliff around me collapsed, and I fell into the gorge.

-----

I was totally going to end it here for tonight, but that just felt cruel.

-----

I heard Sila scream my name, “QUINN!”, as I tumbled down the scree like slope. It wasn’t quite vertical, and I managed to slow my fall slightly, though I probably collected a lot of bruises in the process. I was able to avoid hitting my head on anything on the way down, but I landed in the river head first. I plunged into the water and with one arm I just barely managed to keep my head from hitting any of the rocks jutting up out of the river bed. I felt the impact all the way up to my shoulder and my arm went numb.

Damn it was cold, and it took me a second to work out which way was up. It was impossible to see anything in the murky brown water, and I only found my bearings when I was slammed into one of the rocks protruding from the river bed. I was able to get my head above water, and I took a gasping breath. I looked around, clinging to the rock with my one good arm, and trying to figure out how the hell to get out of the freezing water. The fall and the sudden introduction to freezing water had rattled me and made it really hard to think. It looked like the current would at least carry me away from the valley, and no opportunity to escape the river presented itself as I looked around. Both sides were sheer, and even if I managed to pull myself to a stop on the side of the cliff there was no way in hell I’d be able to climb, and not with only one good arm. I was going to have to do my best to avoid drowning or breaking anything else while I let the river carried me out of the mountains. It was not going to be a short swim, it would have taken us another hour to get clear of the mountains if we’d been walking, and while the river was moving along a whole lot quicker than walking speed even a single minute was going to feel like an eternity. Especially when I’d be swimming with only one arm, I bit the bullet though, and pushed off of the rock.

 I managed not to bash my brains out against anything while going through the rest of the rapids, and about a year later I was finally out of the pass. I managed to drag myself out of the water at a bend in the river, and I collapsed onto the rough pebbles at the riverbank. I might have been in the river for fewer than five minutes, but I was absolutely spent. I tried to push myself up, but even if both arms had worked, I just did not have the strength. I knew I needed to get warm and dry as soon as possible, but I was finding that difficult at the moment. Instead I started with simple things, like checking on the state of my arm. I managed to pull off my sodden hoodie, thankfully it zipped in the front so I wasn’t tweaking my shoulder too much. I took a look at the arm, and I had a tingly, buzzing sensation as I started to regain feeling in my arm. I felt very carefully along it, and it didn’t feel like anything was broken. Granted, I was going to have a hard time knowing for sure without obvious signs like bloody shards of bone sticking up out of my skin. I massaged the arm, trying to regain feeling, and as I did I felt more and more pain in my right shoulder. It seemed like I’d jammed the joint, rather than breaking any of my bones.

Finally I felt strong enough to stand, and I made the lengthy and arduous trek from the river bank, to the road a short distance away. Exhausted from my journey I collapsed back down onto the road, breath coming in ragged gasps. I took a look in my bag, dreading what I might find. Sure enough the contents were ruined. The spellbook was a sodden heap, the maps had basically flaked apart, the drink powders I’d been saving for a special occasion made the inside of the bag stick, and the stupid packet of Cepacol only made that worse, my phone *Fuck* was full of water, and the pemmican was unrecognizable. All ruined. The Maglite at least still lit up, and the phone could probably be dried out if I was careful with it. I looked over Franken-Bow, I was terrified that I might have crushed it in the tumble down the cliff or in the lengthy swim, but it seemed okay.

*1 hour’s walk to the way-station, 1 hour to wait for the group, assuming they don’t wait around trying to find me near where I fell. This has not gone well.*

An hour was too long to wait, I was already shivering, and if I waited I was going to get hypothermic well before they arrived. I could get out of my wet clothes, but into what? Aside from having nothing dry to wear I also had nothing to dry off with. Trying to collect enough wood for a fire would be damn near impossible as well.

I looked around and I could count the number of nearby trees on half the fingers on one hand. I could see the smoke from the way-station though, far off in the distance.

*1 hour to walk, at least at the speed the elves walk. So it’s maybe 4 miles away? This is going to suck.*

I threw everything that had been ruined out of my bag and onto the road, saving only my phone. I did not want to be carrying useless weight, and hopefully the others would see this here and get the idea that I wasn’t dead, and had in fact gone to the way-station.

I stood up, already well past the point of exhaustion, and started running.

*Five minute mile, 4 miles, 20 minutes. I am so gonna die.*

-----



# Chapter 11

I didn’t die. Which was nice.

By the time I got to the way-station I was delirious and could barely run in a straight line. The runner’s high did a lot to dampen my feeling that my heart was about to burst, but it also made me loopy. I collapsed against the door frame, still soaked from the dunk in the river, and it took me a minute to figure out how to work the door handle. I pushed open the door to find the room empty except for a tiny, compared to me, woman cleaning one of the tables. She looked up from her task upon hearing the door, and I could see a combination of confusion and shock on her face.

“Hi,” I said, right before I passed out.

-----

My head hurt like hell when I woke up, but I was warm and dry at least. Feeling had returned to my arm as well. It was a really unpleasant feeling since my shoulder hurt like hell, but I wasn’t crippled. I lifted my other hand to my head, and felt at it. I could feel a lump on my forehead, I’d probably bounced my head off the floor when I passed out. The rest of me was also very sore, which was not helped by the fact that the bed, again, was too short. I was kind of crumpled up to fit in the small bed, I guess whoever dragged me up here hadn’t really known what else to do with me. I sat up against the headboard to try to stretch out my legs, which helped with the soreness a little, and I noticed for the first time that I was naked. I took a look around the room, hopefully my clothes were somewhere in here. I could see wan sunlight coming in through the window, it looked like it was evening of the same day, I couldn’t have been out for more than an hour or two. The furnishings were rustic, rougher even than the furnishings in Harp’s tavern. My watch and glasses were on the side table, and I could see that the glasses looked a little crooked. I suppose I’d fallen face first onto them when I passed out, and I suddenly realized how lucky I was not to lose them in the river. There were also some clothes piled next to my belongings, though they weren’t mine.

*If it’s only been a couple hours then mine are probably still soaked.*

The clothes were definitely too short, but they were workable. The shirt was a bit tight in the shoulders and the arms were too short, but my waist isn’t that wide and the pants fit, even if they did look like capris on someone my height. I rolled the sleeves up on the shirt and stood up, careful not to hit my head on the low ceiling. I was barefoot, which wasn’t great on the rough wood floor. I took the opportunity to confirm that I hadn’t lost any toes, and I could see that I still had all my fingers as well. I’d already checked on the most important of my appendages when I’d first sat up.

I opened the door, ducking further under the door frame, and stepped out into the hall to look around. There were several more doors along the hall, presumably leading to more rooms, and I could hear what sounded like Pell’s voice on my left. The hall opened up into the common room, just a bit behind and to the side of the bar. The others were seated at one of the tables and were talking to the woman from earlier, it sounded like they were explaining what had happened. Pell looked up sharply when he saw me.

“Quinn,” he exclaimed, looked concerned “You should be in bed!”

I waved one hand dismissively, “I’m fine. I’m warmed up now and I’ll be rested enough to travel by morning.”

“You could have told me,” said the woman from earlier, “I thought a giant’d walked in and dropped dead on my floor. You looked frozen and half drowned.”

“Well, you were basically right except for the being dead thing. Thank you for all the help, and also the clothes,” I said, gesturing down at myself. I could see the clothes from my pack hanging near the fire to dry.

She opened her mouth to respond, but Sila interrupted her, “What happened? We thought you’d died! I thought for sure you’d break your neck and drown, I was terrified that we’d come upon your body washed up on the side of the river! Why didn’t you come back to tell us you were alright? When we saw your things in the road I thought a bandit had taken all your things!” Sila was taking quickly, and she was on the verge of tears.

I took a seat at the table, “Would you like something to eat?” the innkeeper cut in before I began.

“Certainly, thank you very much,” and she went off to the woodstove behind the bar to put something together, “Well I didn’t fall right into the river, I sort of slid down the slope which helped to slowed me down. That and the water meant that I didn’t hit the river bottom and break anything. I did jam my shoulder though,” I said, rolling my injured shoulder, “I managed to get out of the river once I was free of the pass. I would have waited for you, but I was wet and freezing. You guys were still an hour away, so I ran as fast as I could to the inn. The run kept me warm enough to not freeze, and it got me here in time to warm up and get dry. I hoped you’d get the idea that I was alive from the stuff I left on the trail, but I didn’t really have time to stick around.”

This did not seem like a satisfactory explanation to Sila, and she still looked like she was going to cry. *I guess we’re still not quite finished with each other, are we.*

Moss shook his head slowly, “I thought for sure that you were dead Quinn, for all that Sila was hoping you weren’t,” at this Sila glanced towards Moss and turned a little pink, “The fall or the cold would have killed any elf, even an orc wouldn’t have the strength to swim for that long.”

“Well to be fair, I was mostly just treading water. The river did most of the moving and I kinda got dragged along with it, most of the difficulty was from trying not to smash my head open against the cliff or any of the boulders in the river.”

It turned out that it was not the right thing to say. I could tell that it was not the right thing to say because Sila immediately burst into tears.

Maybe I just lack empathy, but I find it annoying when people near me start crying. I don’t know what the hell I’m supposed to do with myself in that situation, and I usually end up standing or sitting there awkwardly waiting for them to stop. Am I supposed to say something comforting? Should I give them a hug? It’s damned inconvenient, and somehow the whole thing ends up being my fault. Thankfully Sila solved my predicament for me by running off down the hall, presumably to her own room to cry some more.

Pell and Moss looked at me like I’d just kicked a puppy, and I could feel the innkeepers disapproving eyes on my back.

“So I guess that was the wrong thing to say?”

Pell put his head in his hands and Moss rolled his eyes. I threw up my hands, and the innkeeper *inkeepress?* brought over stew for everyone. She gave me a look that said *You are a stupid, stupid man, squandering the attentions of a beautiful woman.*

I just sat there and ate my damn stew.

-----

I managed to browbeat the others into continuing on the following morning, despite the fact that they seemed to think I’d drop dead if I walked one more step. I did take the opportunity to sleep in a little though, I had been exhausted enough to pass right out despite the bed being uncomfortably small. We ended up leaving for Colos at around 8am, and I was glad to finally be on my way to what passed for civilization here in Rhona.

Sila had fortunately calmed down from the previous evening, though she’d gone back to not talking to me. The others were pretty quiet as well, saving their breath for the day’s journey. Hiking with elves was quite a lot quieter than hiking with other humans. When I was in Algonquin Park all those months ago with my friends we had chatted nearly the whole way, pointing out interesting sights or animals, but elves seemed much less talkative. They seemed to have a hard enough time just covering the distance in a reasonable amount of time, so they avoided getting thirsty and out of breath from talking the whole way.

Instead as I walked I thought about my plans for Colos. Ideally I was going to stay in the city for the one night, gamble a little, and then the following morning I’d start out for Myra. If I kept to my schedule I’d stop that night in a village just outside of Myra, and I’d be able to get to Myra around noon the day after that. The rest of the day in Myra would be spent looking for a ship to Nimre, and if I was lucky I’d have found a ship and be on my way by the fourth or fifth day. I’d accounted for a week spent looking for transportation. In theory I could push that further, but then I’d be cutting into the days I’d set aside for resting. Granted, if I found a ship then I’d potentially be weeks ahead of schedule, but it could just as easily be the case that there weren’t going to be any suitable ships for some time. I couldn’t waste time waiting for a ship that would never come. Another potential delay that might cut into my week looking for ships would be if Moss and Pell expected me to help them get set up in Colos. I liked both of them, but I wanted to get the hell on my way.

Honestly, the others were probably right. If I was smart I would have spent a day or two resting after the ordeal in the river, but spending one more day sitting still would have driven me crazy. Fortunately the day’s travel was uneventful, and we arrived at Colos just as the sun was reaching the horizon.

-----

Surprisingly, the city didn’t stink. I’d been expecting medieval cities to be awful smelling trash heaps with terrible sanitation, but it seemed like elves had the whole thing sorted out. *Well I suppose they’d need to have things sorted out. I don’t think it was until the late Victorian era that more people would be born than died in cities. Elves have children so infrequently that they couldn’t maintain the city’s population with immigrants from the countryside like humans had historically.*

Pell and Sila were both looking around in awe as we approached the city ‘wall’, “This place is a fortress,” said Pell.

I looked over at Moss with a sceptical expression, and he shrugged. The ‘fortress’ was only a simple wooden palisade. Earth had been piled up against the inside to lend stability and to give the defenders a place to stand, but it was not terribly impressive. The gatehouse we were approaching was at least made of stone, and there were a few soldiers guarding the open gates. I’d been expecting some sort of challenge from the guards *Be yee friend or foe?* but we breezed right through, though I did get quite a few odd looks from the men at the gate. That was something that I should have spent more time considering, I was going to stick out like a six and a half foot sore thumb, and I didn’t have enough experience with elves to know if that was a good thing or a bad thing.

“Hey Moss, how do elves usually feel about strangers?” I inquired.

“You don’t mean strangers that look like freakish half-giant half-elf hybrids do you?”

“No, of course not.”

“Well I don’t really know how elves compare to humans, what are you worried about? How would a human respond to such a stranger?”

“Well that depends a lot on the society and time period,” I explained, “The only two obvious differences between me and an elf are the ears and the height difference. If a giant stranger passed through a town like this, but of humans rather than elves, then the stranger might be shunned or feared. Or the villagers might just think that the stranger was a little odd and carry on, as long as the giant didn’t make a nuisance of himself.”

“It’s much the same with elves I suppose, best thing to do is probably to avoid drawing attention to yourself,” I gave him a pointed look, “Well, don’t draw any more attention to yourself, and otherwise avoid trouble. Some elves will just take a dislike to you, but there’s not much you can do to please people like that.”

I nodded, thoughtful, “Alright, well where are we staying for the night then? I think this is the first place where we’ve had a choice of places to stay.”

“There’s an inn named The Dancing Stone near the Count’s manor, it’s where the merchants and nobles too unimportant to stay at the manor itself spend their time while waiting for the Count to see them.”

“Isn’t that going to be expensive?” Asked Pell, “I thought we needed to save our money to get ourselves started here in the city.”

“We *are* going to use the money to get ourselves started. We don’t have the money to buy a place to set up a workshop, and if we try to find a building to rent, our money might drain away before we get enough customers coming through. What we want to do is find a patron, someone who’s interested enough in what you’ve made to support us. And no one throws money around like bored merchants and nobles.”

“Bored merchants and nobles you say?” I said, grinning, “I wonder if they also like to waste time drinking and playing cards?”

-----

As it turns out, bored merchants and nobles do like to waste time drinking and playing cards.

We got in to The Dancing Stone right in the middle of dinner, and the inn was doing a rather good trade. My only concern going in had been that we weren’t really dressed for a fancy hotel, but I need not have worried. I’d been expecting a Bronze Age Marriott, but I hadn’t considered the realities of traveling in a Bronze Age society. Whether you walk, ride, or sail, most people aren’t going to be traveling around in a suit and tie. *Or would that be a doublet and cravat?* either way, we didn’t stand out. At least, the others didn’t. I drew attention immediately, though as it happened, that wasn’t a bad thing. While Moss was chatting up the owner, who was apparently an old friend, I was invited to take a seat with a group of the aforementioned bored noblemen after they noticed me looking over their game of dice with interest.

They seemed very curious, and while they were distracted asking their questions about my strange clothes and round ears, I managed to get Apportation in place to start fiddling with the dice. I’d noticed early on that I seemed to have no trouble keeping a spell up once it was cast. According to the book most of the spells took 1 mana every minute to maintain, but I seemed to maintain them with no difficulty. This further reinforced my hypothesis that I had one mana, or at least less than two, but with a really high recovery rate. Especially since I could have five such spells on at once, each taking one mana every minute.

Once I cast Apportation I didn’t have much trouble coming out ahead. The difficulty then was not about being careful enough to alter the dice in a way that looked natural, instead the trick was to carefully choose **when** to do it. I had plenty of practice making the altered rolls look natural, but winning too much will tip people off regardless, even if they come to the false assumption that it’s the dice that are fixed. Instead I’d only fix rolls in my favour on every tenth roll or so, I’d lose some, but I did it enough to win slightly more. In fact, most times when I altered a roll it was in someone else’s favour. If I got the impression that someone was running low on funds, or were about to leave, they’d get a suddenly lucky streak. I didn’t want any one person doing so poorly that they left, or so well that they quit while they were ahead. The longer they played the more I made. My strategy worked quite well, and by the end of the night I was 12 drachm richer.

-----

I woke up around seven the next morning, I was planning on saying goodbye, but I also wanted to get on my way as soon as possible. I had ships to catch and magic to learn. I came down to the common room to find it about half full. The actual travelers were already up and eating breakfast, while the noblemen were still in bed since they didn’t really have anywhere to be today. Even if the Count, *still don’t know what the Count’s name is,* called upon them today it wouldn’t be so early in the morning. I came down with my backpack over one shoulder, ready to travel. Hopefully Moss and Pell would get the idea, and not ask me to stick around to help them set up the business. I did feel slightly guilty, after all it had been my idea for Pell to setup here in Colos, but that didn’t make it my responsibility.

Moss, Pell, and Sila were sitting at a table with a couple other people. Pell had some of his goods sitting on the table, though Moss seemed to be leading the conversation, and Pell was not saying much. I ordered breakfast from one of the girls serving customers in the tavern, and then I sat at the table with my traveling companions. I nodded to Moss and the others as I sat, but did not interrupt his sales pitch.

“…As you know,” Moss was saying, and I was sure from the expressions of the other two men that they did not know, “Aluminum is very easy to work, which means that the costs to set up a proper workshop are a fraction the price of even what it takes to outfit a tinsmith. When compared to the potential profit it’s obvious that in very short order it would be possible for the Count to recoup his costs. Think of the prestige as well that could be earned for your uncle, while a Duke might pay patron to a personal goldsmith, Aluminum would be even more impressive.”

*I guess Moss skipped right to the Count himself, damn, he doesn’t waste time.*

The two men, teenagers really, seemed to consider this carefully for a moment. Or at least they tried to put on the expression of someone carefully considering something.

“What about when you run out though? You’ve only brought so much,” The kids were young, but evidently not stupid.

“Don’t worry,” Moss soothed, “We have more supplies than what we’ve brought along, we are not so foolish as to risk our whole supply traveling the roads. Not only that, but consider this. By the time the supplies run out, not only will your Uncle already be very wealthy, but Pell here will have had far more experience with Aluminum than any other smith in Rhona. Perhaps all of Elardia. If other nobles and royalty have aluminum, and wish for goods to be made of it then they might instead look to Pell, rather than take it to a local smith. They would of course want the greatest craftsman working such a rare material, it’s not something you would waste on an amateur. We could of course purchase more Aluminum with the money made selling our initial stock.”

 “Well,” said the other of the two nephews, the one who hadn’t asked the question. He looked over at his brother, unsure.

“I believe you make a very interesting case, I think we will relay this information to our Uncle, so that he may decide,” said the first brother, eager to pass the buck.

“Well, good day then,” said the second brother, a little awkwardly, and the two left.

I looked over at Moss and Pell, “Well that seems to have gone well.”

“It’s a good thing Moss came along with us to Colos. I’d have no idea how to try to sell my goods to men like that,” Pell said, seeming relieved that the two boys had left.

The *wench?* set my food in front of me, and I thanked her.

“Men, pah,” Said Moss, “Boys, on an errand for their Uncle. Hopefully the Count will find what they tell him interesting enough that he’ll consider meeting us in person.”

“We’re going to meet the count?” asked Sila, both excited and a little worried, “Oh no, I left my feast day dress at home, and I can’t wear this to meet him,” she said, worrying over her faded linen dress.

Pell seemed to have a similar concern, and looked to Moss, wide-eyed, “It will be fine, I know a tailor in town. She’ll be more than willing to get you some proper clothes to meet the Count, and she’ll let us pay her back afterwards.”

This did not seem to put their concerns entirely to rest, but they did relax a little. Sila and Pell were definitely out of their comfort zone. Not only were they many dozens of miles further from home than they’d ever been, but they were –hopefully- going to meet what they probably considered to be a higher class of person.

*There aren’t six million people in all of Rhona, maybe not even all of Elardia. There’s no way in hell I’d be this awestruck upon meeting the mayor of Toronto.*

“Planning on leaving today then Quinn?” asked Pell.

“Yeah, I need to get on my way. I should be in Myra by noon tomorrow, and from there I’ll have about a week to find a ship to Nimre.”

“What if you don’t find one?” Asked Sila, seeming a little conflicted.

“Well I could risk staying, waiting longer to find a ship. But if I can’t find a ship then I need to walk to Nimre, and every day I do stay cuts into time I’ve set aside for resting along the way. It’s a gamble, so hopefully I find something in the first week.”

“You remember what I said before Quinn?” Asked Moss.

“About the sort of ship to look for? Yeah, captains running ships for large merchant families. I was thinking that I’d try to find one running perishable goods, something that doesn’t keep too long.”

Moss raised his eyebrows at this, and I elaborated, “I don’t really want to be on a ship that stops in Adympia. So I figure I find a ship that’s either not going to stop until it arrives at its destination, or one that’s not going to be stopping for very long. That probably means a ship running perishable goods, or possibly mail.”

Moss nodded approvingly, “That’s quite a good plan. Mail carriers work for the crown, but they’re in much the same situation as the merchant captains. They’re paid by the mile, and less even than the merchants are. They’ll also have even more space than the merchants will. You should have better luck finding a mail carrier than a cargo ship. It’s still early in the year yet for shipping, but that just means that there’s going to be a lot of mail that needs to get on its way.”

We chatted for a little longer as we ate our meals, and then it came time to say our goodbyes. Sort of like the crying thing, I have a hard time with goodbyes. I’m perfectly content to say “Goodbye,” and then get the hell on my way. Other people though seem to get a little emotional, and it can take forever to finally get out the door without offending anyone. I resolved to get this over with as quickly as possible.

I waved over the, *wench? I’m going with wench,* and paid for my room and board, leaving a decent tip. I’m pretty sure elves tipped, so I tipped.

I stood, extending a hand towards Moss, “Well, I appreciate all the advice you’ve given me Moss.”

He seemed a little surprised at how abruptly I was leaving, but he shook, “We’ll be sad to see you go.”

I extended my hand to Pell, “Thanks for giving me a place to work while I was in Essens.”

He shook as well, “You helped me far more than I helped you Quinn, not just the forge, but this as well,” he said, gesturing towards the Aluminum jewellery and trinkets still on the table.

“You’re quite welcome,” and I extended my hand to Sila, “Goodbye Sila.”

She took my hand, “Goodbye Quinn.”

I raised a hand in farewell, and I left the inn.

-----

As soon as I heard the door close behind me I let out a breath that I hadn’t realized I’d been holding. It wasn’t that I disliked the people I’d spent the last several months with, and I had no idea how I felt about Sila, but I was still glad to be leaving.

Then I heard the door open behind me, and I turned to see Sila running out.

*Oh for fuck’s sake.*

She ran right into me, and wrapped her arms around me, “You will come back won’t you?” She asked.

*Nope.*

“Maybe? I don’t know how much free time I’ll have once I’ve started classes. Probably once my studies are done.”

“Well, I supposed that’s going to have to be good enough then,” she said, her voice muffled by my sweater.

I felt rather awkward, it was still early morning which meant that there weren’t many people around, but I still felt very self-conscious at the public display of affection. I sort of patted her on the shoulder, waiting for her to let go of me, and she finally stepped back. Her eyes were a little red, but she wasn’t quite crying.

“Bye Quinn.”

“Bye Sila.”

And I left, without looking back.

# Chapter 12

Without the others along I covered the distance to Myra quite a lot faster than I would have otherwise. Aside from just being able to walk more quickly, I was also carrying a lot less weight. Not only had I left the aluminum I’d been carrying with Pell, but I also didn’t need to carry as much food and water since I’d be stopping in villages and towns for lunch, rather than bringing along the food to eat on the road. I also hadn’t yet replaced my ruined pemmican, and I decided to wait until I reached Myra to try to find something suitable. After all, if I found a ship I probably wasn’t going to need it quite as much.

The journey to Myra passed rather uneventfully, and it was near noon on the second day alone when I crested a hill, coming into sight of the city. Myra was clearly quite a lot larger than Colos was, Sila had mentioned that Colos had something like ten thousand people, Myra must have had nearer one hundred thousand. From my vantage point on the hill I could see that the city covered about four times as much area, and the buildings within seemed both larger, and more densely packed. The walls were also proper stone, rather than a simple wooden palisade like Colos had. They were quite high, maybe fifty feet tall.

*I guess that they’d have a much easier time shipping in stone since they’re right on the water. Colos would need to drag it nearly ninety miles inland, or quarry it basically on site.*

The city did not have much of a harbour to work with, and instead I could see long wharfs extending out into the sea. *Unless it’s an ocean.* With the sailing ships tied up alongside. Seeing the ships reinforced my belief that the local level of technological development was about Greco-Roman. *TL2* All of the ships appeared to be galleys of some sort, like ancient Greek triremes, though some had two or four sails instead of three. *Biremes and quadriremes I think?* I could see one major difference though, between the ships out in the sea and the Greek equivalents. None of the ships I could see seemed to have oars, and were relying instead only on wind power. Human made triremes had two or even sometimes three banks of rowers, but I couldn’t see anything like that out in the bay.

*I guess rowing isn’t really an option for a race that has such limited endurance.*

I pulled out my waterproof notebook, and added ‘Steam Ships’ to my list of things to introduce under my ‘Steam Power’ heading.

As I continued down the hard packed dirt road I realized that there was a gaping hole in my plan. I had no idea how much it was going to cost to hitch a ride on a ship. This was the sort of thing that might be rather expensive. If it wasn’t expensive then everyone would get around by ship, especially since elves seemed to have a very hard time covering distances on foot. I might be able to find a ship, but not afford it. On the other hand, it might not be expensive at all. If some captain is trying to make some drachm on the side and doesn’t have a bunch of people clamouring for a spot, he might not ask for much at all, especially if it’s not his ship and he’s not paying for the supplies I’d be using during the voyage.

Well the first step would be to get in the front gate, which might be a problem for me. When I’d stopped at the villages on my way to Myra I hadn’t had things thrown at me or been spit on, but it was clear that I made people uneasy. From what I’d gleaned from the few books I’d read and what I heard from Moss, I was about the height of a tall Orc, or a short Giant. I was slimmer than either since I favoured cardio over strength training, but I was still more thickly built than any elf I’d seen other than Pell. While the nobles I’d met in Colos had been somewhat more relaxed, they were a bit more worldly than common folk, and they might have been slightly drunk at the time. The common folk I’d met on the other hand were much like the people I’d met in Essens, they hadn’t been more than a couple dozen miles from home. Worse than that, while the elves in the valley were insulated from most strife by the mountains, these people had to deal with the realities of life in an early-medieval village. This meant that they lacked the innocence that the elves in the valley had. Harp had seen me as an odd but otherwise harmless curiosity, while the innkeepers I met outside of the valley seemed to see me as a potential threat, especially since I was no longer accompanied by other elves.

I’d placed the dagger and hatchet in my pack before coming down from the hill, though I still had my folding knife in my pocket if I really needed a weapon. It wasn’t great, since it lacked a hilt, and I also didn’t want to start a fight with some city guards, but it was better than nothing.

The gate I approached was not particularly busy, so the guards there noticed me when I was still a fair ways off. I could see the four of them huddle together in conversation, then one of them ran off around the inside of the wall.

*Uh oh.*

The fourth one returned just before I got there, bringing a fifth elf, this one looked to be the one in charge. The other four all had rather simple uniforms, and the word uniform could be used loosely. The first four all seemed to be wearing what were basically their everyday work clothes, not that different from what Harp wore when working at his tavern, but had a yellow cloak worn over this. The newcomer was dressed similarly, though his clothes seemed to be somewhat nicer, and his cloak was orange. I didn’t know a whole lot about the colours of medieval dyes, Dwarf Fortress didn’t go into much detail there, but I did an inventory of myself to check if I was wearing any colours I should be wearing, or shouldn’t have access to.

*Jeans, very dark blue-black, probably okay? Sila had that blue feast day dress. Hoodie, also very dark blue, also probably fine. Shirt, burgundy, I left the blue one in my bag. Does burgundy count as purple? Am I not supposed to wear purple?*

As I approached I finally got a close look at Agent Orange, he was probably the first elf I’d met that actually looked older than thirty. If he was a human I’d guess that he was in his mid-forties, but for all I knew, this guy might be two hundred. The yellow cloaked guards on the other hand could have been anywhere from twenty to one hundred and twenty. I was guessing that they were a little on the young side though. They were all standing rather close together, and while they weren’t quite frightened of the giant stranger, they also didn’t want to face him alone.

Agent Orange waved me over as I neared the gate, and I stopped in front of him.

“Hello,” I said.

“Hello there, I’m Sergeant Cuselo,” he said, introducing himself and extending a hand.

“I’m Quinn,” I said, shaking the offered hand.

“I’ve not seen you here before, you new to the city?”

“Yeah, I’m new, just passing through.”

“Oh yeah, where are you going?” He asked, in the too friendly voice that cops like to use when trying to interrogate someone while making it seem like a friendly conversation.

“Nimre,” I said, slightly irritated, but trying not to let it show. If this guard was anything like cops I’d met, then he’d start to get all pissy if it seemed like I wasn’t absolutely thrilled to be speaking with him.

“Oh yeah, when do you think you’ll be leaving?” He asked, continuing with the ‘friendly’ voice.

*And there’s the question, however…*

“I’m not sure, I might be here for a while,” I said, and I could see from his expression that he didn’t like this idea at all, “Unless of course I can find a ship that’s headed the right way. I can’t cover the distance on foot, so I need to find a ship as soon as possible. Would you know if there’s a tavern that caters to captains or officers? I might ask around there to see if I can find passage.”

Agent Orange, or Cuselo rather, seized upon the solution offered to him, “Ah yeah, down near the docks is an inn called The Anchor Chain. I’m sure if you look around there you can find a ship heading for Nimre.”

*Upside, I know where to go, downside, he knows where I’ll be.*

“Thank you very much,” *asshole*, “I appreciate all the help,” I said, as I headed into town to find The Anchor Chain.

*I guess no one cares about burgundy.*

-----

The Anchor Chain was not too hard to find, and I got in a little after lunchtime. Thankfully they weren’t done serving food, and I got myself a nice big bass for lunch. Aside from some of the venison I’d tried as I was making myself the pemmican over a month ago, this was the first time I’d had proper food since arriving in the valley. And damn it was good, little bit of olive oil, little bit of lemon, and some green stuff that I was sure was some sort of herb or spice, it was delicious. This was after all, a fairly nice place. Most places it was just the one drachm and that covered room and board for a night, here it was three drachm just for the meal, and it would be seven more for dinner and a room tonight. It was definitely expensive, especially after a rather generous tip, but I figured it was worth it. Aside from finally satiating my hunger for formerly living creatures, I really did not want to be trekking across most of a continent on foot. If seven drachm a night was what it took to find a ship, then I was happy to spend the money. Catering to wealthier customers also meant that I’d probably make more gambling, so I was fairly sure that I’d be able to at least break even if I stayed here all week.

The rest of the inn matched the quality of the food. The tables and chairs where patrons sat to eat were functional, but still featured some fancy scrollwork and were stained a rich dark brown. The innkeeper and the serving girls were also better dressed and better spoken than what I’d been used to while traveling here. There was even a nice sitting area near the fire with some nice upholstered chairs where patrons could sit and relax.

One of the serving girls came over to take away my plate, and I tried not to let her notice quite the way I was looking at her.

I remembered Sila mentioning that some of the elves in the city claimed to be of a different sort than the elves in the villages, and I’d originally chalked this up to some lower class versus upper class snobbery, though I’d noticed some details while passing through the city. There were clear differences to be seen between the village elves, *wood elves I guess?*, and city elves, *high elves maybe?* They were both roughly the same height, and the city elves were still rather slim, but they were proportioned rather more generously than the wood elves. This was something I had noticed around the serving girl’s hips and chest, and she was definitely not someone that I’d mistake for a child. The colouration was another clear difference, though it wasn’t as stark as the difference between some humans. The wood elves weren’t really dark skinned, they were still somewhat fair, but somehow ‘earthy’ seemed like a rather good adjective to use. The variety of hair and eye colours I saw followed this theme, their hair and eyes were generally some shade of brown, though there was the odd wood elf like Moss that had green hair or green eyes.

The city elves on the other hand, calling them high elves felt wrong, were pale and had much more variety in hair and eye colour. I saw some almost metallic seeming shades, copper, which was my personal favourite, various shades of silver, and there were even some with steel-like grey hair. I didn’t see anyone with gold-like blonde hair, though that may have simply been due to my limited sample size. Eye colour was what I found most interesting though, there were the greens and blues, but there were also some elves with purple, lavender, yellow, or orange eyes. The particular girl that had been serving me had long pale silver hair, up in a bun, and lavender eyes. I found the combination rather stunning, especially with her huge elfin eyes. The clothes certainly helped the impression, she was wearing a light pink dress, laced tightly up the back. It was especially tight around the waist, and between the resulting hourglass shape and her sharply attractive features it took some work not to stare.

*Whoa there Quinn, down boy.*  

“How was everything?” She asked politely.

“It was fantastic, thank you very much,” I responded equally politely, “I did have a question though.”

“Oh, is there something else I can get for you?”

“I’m looking to make my way to Nimre, you must know an awful lot about what goes on here,” I said, seeing how flattery did when combined with the nice tip, “Do you know if any of the captains here are headed that way? I’m looking to hop a ship to Nimre, and I certainly don’t want to try crossing Adympia to get there.”

“Oh no,” she said, voice getting a little higher, “You’re right, even if you had the right papers to travel, you might end up in trouble. Any Adympian house would pay a lot of money to add someone as special as you to their collection.”

“Someone as special as me you say?” I asked raising my eyebrows, serious expression on my face.

She narrowed her eyes a little, “I simply meant that you’re unique.”

“Of course, I didn’t mean to suggest that you meant anything different,” I said in a lazy tone.

She smiled a little, biting the corner of her lower lip, “There’s some ships headed that way, are you going to be staying here for dinner? I can point them out to you then if you like.”

“Just hold on a second, now you’re asking me to stay for dinner?” I asked, enjoying the game, “And you’re holding hostage my only chance to avoid a possible life of slavery. I can’t believe you, taking advantage of an innocent traveler like this, it’s just awful.”

She pursed her lips, “Are you staying for dinner or not,” she asked, tone a little cocky.

“Well I suppose I have no choice now,” I said, feigning resignation.

“I’ll just put this away,” she said, picking up my plate,” and we can get you a room so you can put away your things,” nodding at the bag next to my chair.

*Careful Quinn, manage your expectations.*

-----

Once she’d put away my dishes she showed me upstairs, and a question came to mind.

“I don’t suppose you have any rooms that are built for someone my size?” I asked, dreading another night crumpled up in a tiny bed.

“Oh we do,” she said excitedly, “There are a few Giant clans that send down ships to trade, and sometimes they stay here. There should be plenty of space for you in one of the Giant rooms.”

“That sounds perfect,” I said, relieved. I was pretty sure that the average giant was around seven feet tall, so I’d have more than enough space to stretch out.

“Here,” she said, opening a door at the end of the hall, one of two that was taller than any of the others in the hallway.

I looked around, and the room seemed perfect. I didn’t even need to duck under the doorway, the bed was probably eight feet long and nearly as wide, and all the furniture seemed large enough that I wouldn’t feel like I was about to break something if I took a seat at the desk. There was even a fireplace set into one wall, with a few chairs like those downstairs set around it.

She was looking up at me, with a smile on her face, “I guess you like it then.”

“Imagine spending three and a half months sleeping in beds that are only four feet long. This is fantastic, thank you very much,” I said gratefully.

“Well let me know if there’s anything else you need, I’ll let you wash up. There’s a bathroom right through there,” she said, pointing to a door on one wall of the room, “And if there’s any clothes you want washed just put them in there,” and she pointed to a basket just inside the door.

“Oh,” I said, just as she was about to leave, “I’m Quinn by the way.”

“Thera,” She said, extending a hand, and I shook it.

She thumped me on the chest, “Now go take a bath, you smell all sweaty,” and she was out the door before I could retort.

-----

I set down my pack on the desk after she left, and then inspected the bathroom. Aside from everything being made of brass or copper rather than porcelain or plastic, it looked very much like a modern bathroom. *I guess I was right about the sanitation thing. And judging from the lack of smell on most people, they must also bathe regularly.* I ran the bath and stripped out of my clothes, throwing them into the basket. I had modern spares for everything except the jeans, and I’d gotten myself a pair of linen trousers before leaving Essens, so I set those out instead. They were all in good shape too, I’d not worn them since leaving Essens, and they’d also gotten a good rinsing after my bath in the river.

Oh god, the bath felt amazing. Not only was it fantastically hot, almost too hot, **but the tub was big enough for me!** I hadn’t even had that luxury on Earth, I’d always have to sit with my knees pulled up out of the water. But here I could lay back and stretch my legs out in front of me, it felt fantastic on my aching muscles.

-----

I lay there in the bath for nearly an hour, and even then, I had to spend some time thinking about it before I finally decided that I did in fact need to get up and get dressed. I saw that my laundry had already been taken away, and I dressed in my second set of clothes. I pulled my jacket out of my bag, the hoodie having gone with the laundry, and I shrugged into it as I headed downstairs. Thera was busy with another customer when I came down into the common room, but she noticed me out of the corner of her eye as I was heading out into the city and gave me a little wave goodbye as I left.

-----

I wanted to see more of the city, but I also had some errands to run. The first thing I wanted to do was try to sell some of my aluminum dice, I had three sets, and I really only needed one to play. I looked around for a bit, not sure where the best place to sell the dice would be. Maybe a jeweller? They might melt down the aluminum and use the material in something else. Or maybe a shop selling expensive curiosities? They might resell the dice as is to some wealthy noble who wanted something to impress his gambling friends. Well, I had two sets of dice to sell, so I resolved to check on both options. First would be the jeweller, mostly because it was much easier to find than the alternative.

I looked for one that was fancy, but not so fancy that they wouldn’t bother reselling interesting pieces. I had heard Victorian era stories where down on their luck families would sell family heirlooms or some jewellery to make ends meet, and I figured that Myra couldn’t be much different. In fact, Victorian seemed like a pretty good approximation of what I saw. While the level of technology was definitely Greco-Roman, there seemed to be a fondness for corsets among the upper class women. *Thera’s dress is likely designed to mimic the style of a corset, without being so expensive or hard to move in.* It wasn’t taken to quite the extreme that Victorian era clothing was though, which was probably due to the Mediterranean climate. There we no large hoop dresses and no one seemed to dress in layers like was common in Victorian London, it was too warm already for that sort of thing, and it was still early spring.

I ducked into a jeweller’s that looked promising, and waited patiently while the only other customer in the shop was served. I had initially been unsure if I was dressed suitably for somewhere so fancy, but I thought that I might be okay. My clothes were foreign enough that I hoped that no one would recognize the more casual cut, and I guessed that the colours would help sell the idea that I belonged in such a nice store. It took a lot of work to ‘fix’ natural dyes so that they didn’t fade, and even then getting a consistent colour across the whole garment was hard, and there would be a little variation. Made with modern techniques my shirt and coat must have looked like they’d just been freshly dyed, and with the highest quality colours available.

My hypothesis was confirmed once the proprietor finally got done with the other customer. He looked me over once he’d finished with the man he’d been serving, and I got the sense that he’d mentally categorized me under ‘foreign, but wealthy’. This worked for me, and I decided to play along.

“Good afternoon my Goodman,” he greeted me, making ‘good man’ sound like a form of address, like ‘Mister’ or ‘Sir’, “What may I help you with?”

I withdrew one set of the dice from my pocket, and set them on the counter between us, “Do you know what metal this is made of?” I asked, nodding towards the dice.

He reached for one of the dice, “Ah, may I?”

“Certainly.”

He picked up the die, feeling the weight, “Why, this must be nearly pure aluminum,” he said, as he looked to me, seeming surprised.

“It is in fact pure aluminum.”

“This is quite the impressive piece of work, but why are you showing it to me?”

“I’m given to understand that this is the sort of place that might pay for such goods?” I asked, and he nodded, ”Well I simply must get to Nimre, I’ve meetings to keep in the city. Unfortunately it seems that your elfin captains and merchants are fairly picky, and they don’t want to take Canadian coin. I only have so many drachm to hand, but I was told that elves hold this metal in high esteem. I would be grateful if you might help resolve these issues so that my expedition might continue,” I did my best to give the impression of a merchant with much to do, and little time to do it. I didn’t think I was that good an actor, but between my foreignness and the fact that I was about to let him pay me half what the dice were worth I don’t think he noticed the trick.

“Oh certainly,” he said excitedly, seeing the opportunity. *A foreigner with no idea of the true value of his goods, fantastic!* “Just let me get my scales.”

He moved over to a cabinet set into the back wall, and drew out a set of merchant’s scales. He held them out, no weight on them, to show that they were fairly balanced. I nodded for him to continue, and he set to work weighing out the dice. He made a show of humming and hawing over a decision, before he finally spoke.

“I can offer you, perhaps, 200 drachm per die,” he said, purposefully.

I said nothing, but instead frowned in thought. This was actually about double what I’d expected to get for them, either he wasn’t cheating me, or aluminum was worth even more than I thought it was.

“Ah, perhaps 250?” he said, a little less certain.

I could probably push it further, but if I could get rid of all the dice now then I might as well. I drew out the rest of the dice, including the set that I was originally going to keep.

“Would you pay as much for all nine of the dice? I’d rather not have to look elsewhere to be rid of the rest, but I understand if such a transaction would be beyond your means.” *Threaten him with competition, and then insult him, but only a little. Just enough to get him to rise to the challenge.*

“Oh by no means,” he said, puffing out his chest and straightening up, “I can certainly handle everything here, no sense in looking around for ages trying to find another merchant that won’t cheat you. Just give me a moment,” and he retreated into a back room, hopefully to get my payment.

*Well, there’s money solved for a while.*

He counted out 2250 drachm onto the counter between us, most of the coins being silver in various sizes, rather than the normal 1 drachm copper pieces. I gathered up the coins, and thanked him for his help before I left on my second errand.

My second errand was straightforward, and hopefully made much easier by my newfound wealth. *I’ve got what, more than three years’ salary for the average person in my pocket right now?* I was going to see if I could find some new spellbooks.

-----

It was an hour after dark before I’d finally gotten back to the tavern, and I’d probably been through every bookstore and curio shop in the whole city. In that time I’d found only two items of note. The first was a book that claimed to teach three spells, Light, Sound, and Basic Illusion. It was titled, rather lamely 'Basic Illusion Magic', by Amus Beraha. Light I already knew, but that wasn’t necessarily a bad thing. If I didn’t have a way to verify the authenticity of the book I might have assumed it to be a fake and left it behind. Detect Magic didn’t seem to detect spellbooks as magical, so instead I looked over the section on Light. The symbols in this book matched up with what I’d memorized, and I went ahead and paid the 150 drachm to get my new spellbook.

The second item of note was a ring, which the owner of the shop claimed was studded with three ‘powerstones’. To me they looked like tiny chips of some brownish quartz like mineral, but Detect Magic seemed to think that the ring was in fact magical. More than that, it told me that the type of magic used was ‘Enchantment’. Supposedly the two smaller stones each stored 1 mana, and the larger central stone stored 2 mana. I wasn’t terribly interested in the two 1 mana stones, since I seemingly already had one mana at an infinitely high recovery rate, but the 2 mana stone might let me cast the more mana-intensive forms of the spells I knew. It was expensive, 300 drachm, but I wasn’t about to let an honest to god magical ring pass me by. Even if it did look like the sort of jewellery you might buy from a push cart at the local mall.

Thera looked up as I walked in, she was sitting behind the bar with her chin propped up in one hand, reading a book. The rest of the patrons hadn’t yet gone to bed, but most of them already had their drinks and had settled in. Some were gambling, some were playing Zatrikion, and others were chatting by the fire. I walked up to the bar and sat on a stool across from her.

“You’re back late, I was worried that you might have gotten into trouble with some guards,” she said, closing her book.

“You were worried about me? Aww, how sweet,” I said, leaning forwards onto the bar.

She rolled her eyes, “Want something to eat?” She asked, standing up.

“Yes please.”

She took out a pair of bass fillets that had been staying warm in the wood stove, and she put each on a plate with some assorted veggies. I watched her as she got dinner ready for, well the two of us I suppose, and I decided that I rather liked the look of her bending over to reach into the stove. She set a plate and some cutlery in front of each of us, and I raised an eyebrow as she sat across from me to eat.

“Well I did ask you to stay for dinner,” she said quietly.

We chatted a little as we ate in the quiet common room, lit by the light from the fireplace and the oil lamps hung on the wall. She asked me what it was like where I was from, she seemed to take the fact that I’d been dropped off by a Banestorm for granted, and I asked her about life here in Myra. It was rather casual conversation, there we no ground-breaking revelations, though I noticed that she seemed to go out of her way to mention in passing that “even different sorts of goblinoids” can’t produce offspring.

*I feel like she might be trying to tell me something.*

We sat there talking for long enough that most people had filed out of the inn, or gone to bed. The only people still in the common room aside from the two of us were the ones seated in the comfy chairs around the fire, engrossed in their own conversation. Even the innkeeper had said goodnight to the two of us before retiring for the night.

“I thought you were going to point out some captains to me?” I said, false accusation in my voice.

“Ah, something must have distracted me,” she said, not looking up at me, “tomorrow night, promise.”

I had no idea what to say next, we were quickly approaching territory almost entirely unknown to me, and I filled time by taking a drink of the tea that Thera had made for us after we’d finished our meal.

Thera apparently had no such reservations. She leaned forwards and put her hand on my shoulder, pulling my face towards hers. I thought for a second that she was about to kiss me, but no such luck. Instead she sniffed at my neck, “You’re all smelly again,” she said, looking up into my eyes challengingly.

I felt a tightness in my chest, and, other places, “Well I was walking around all day, being a tourist is hard work.”

“Go upstairs, take a bath, I’ll be up once I’ve finished for the night,” and before I had a chance to either agree or object, she pushed me back into my seat and slipped off her stool, ducking into a back room.

*Damn. This has gone well.*

-----

I did as… *commanded?* and went up to my room to wash up for the night. I took my time, and gave my face a onceover with the razor, banishing my five o’clock shadow. There was a freshly laundered robe hanging from a hook on the door, and I shrugged into it, tying it loosely before opening the door to the bathroom.

Thera was sitting on the bed, waiting. She’d let her hair down, and it fell in a messy tangle, framing her face She’d put out most of the lights, and the room was lit only by the flickering light of the fireplace.

“Mmmmm,” she murmured, biting her lip and looking at my chest, which was not quite hidden by the linen robe, “Now come unwrap me,” in a quiet voice that was half command, half beg.

“Turn around,” I said softly, as I approached her.

She stood up from the bed, and turned around, pulling her hair to one side.

I found where the laces were tied at her lower back. The dress was done up very tightly, and she let out a contented sigh when I pulled the knot apart. I took my sweet time loosening the rest of the laces, and I was rewarded with more rather intriguing sounds of pleasure for my trouble. I finally loosened it enough for her to free herself, and she wriggled free of the dress. The dress had been tight enough to leave marks, and I could clearly see where the seam had run down her side, and more marks ran up her spine, left there by the laces. I was gentle, doing my best to massage the sore spots. It must have worked, judging from the sounds she was making, and I could feel her relaxing. Finally she arched her back, letting out a shuddering breath.

“Enough,” she said forcefully, voice husky.

She turned, and grabbed at the robe with both fists, and she threw me bodily onto the bed in a display of elfin strength. She straddled me, and I ran one hand down her thigh, running my eyes over her. She looked just as amazing naked as she had in that dress. She was petite like Sila had been, but where Sila had been flat chested with narrow hips, Thera was a bombshell with wide hips and a quite ample bust. Her lips were slightly parted, and her eyes were hungry as she pulled at the belt that tied my robe. I put my hands on her waist, as she finally pulled away what little covering I had. She lifted herself up to mount me but instead I rolled over, pinning her to the bed underneath me, using my greater weight to counter her strength. She let out a primal growl, and tried to pull me into her with her legs, but I held myself off of her, mostly. I rolled my hips, teasing at her opening, as I leaned down to kiss her. She met my mouth hungrily, and I could hear her growl in the back of her throat as she tried to wrap herself around me.

“You seem a little pent up Thera,” I teased, still not quite letting myself all the way down onto her.

She tried to say something, probably unkind, but I pressed my lips down onto hers and whatever she was going to say was muffled by the kiss as she growled at me.

I was probably even more pent up than she was, but I am a definite believer in deferred gratification. I took my time, teasing her, running a hand over her chest and teasing at her nipples. I knew that she’d tire out eventually, all I had to do was keep control of her until she did.

Finally I felt the strength drain away, she was stronger, but just couldn’t keep it up for very long. Then the commanding growls turned into pleading whimpers, and I finally let her have what she wanted. She shuddered, letting out a moan.

“I am so going to make you pay for this,” she gasped out, with the rhythm of our bodies.

Exhausted like she was, she was putty in my arms. She barely had the strength to wrap her legs around my waist and hold on. The height difference made it awkward to kiss her at the same time, and instead she settled for licking and kissing at my chest. Even in this I did my best to torment her, bringing her close, but not quite pushing her over the edge. I took a sick pleasure in having such a degree of control over her, making her beg me to do more to her, and I let it last as long as I could.

“Oh please god, just--- AIIIHHHHHHhhhhh,” she clamped a hand over her mouth and her legs tightened around my waist.

Her eyes got wide and watery and I heard her muffle a high pitched moan. That set me off almost immediately, and I stifled a growl as I held her down roughly and saw to my own needs.

She went limp as I finished, her arms and legs sprawled on the bed. I rolled off of her, and I could see that she had same watery eyed, open mouthed expression on her face as she lay there gasping. We both just lay there in the big bed, exhausted and breathing hard, enjoying the afterglow. She rolled over weakly, and pulled her face into to my side with arm thrown across my chest, and we fell asleep just like that.


# Chapter 13

I woke up feeling amazing. I was comfortable, relaxed, and I felt truly satisfied for the first time in ages. It was very early in the morning, and while I could hear the odd bird chirping outside, the sky was still dark. The fire had burned down to coals and a cool breeze blew in through the open window. Thera was still curled up next to me, her head resting on my shoulder with one arm thrown across my chest. I slid out from under her as carefully as possible, trying not to disturb her. The blankets slipped down her back as she settled into the depression I’d left in the bed, and I stood there for a moment admiring the look of her as she lay sprawled on her side, I was glad to see that the marks left by the tight dress had faded. I was getting a little chilly, standing there naked, and I padded over to the bathroom to answer nature’s call. I’d just washed up in the basin, when I heard the bed creak as if someone was moving around. When I came back into the room Thera was kneeling on the bed with the blankets drawn up around herself. Even with all the blankets I could see that she was shivering visibly, and I recalled that Sila and the other elves I’d met had more difficulty with cold than I did.

“Did I say-y you could l-leave?” She asked, chattering teeth ruining her attempt at a commanding tone.

I pushed Thera onto her back, and I got a hungry grin from her for my trouble, despite her shivering. I lay down beside her and pulled her in close. She was really cold, and I felt a little bad for leaving her uncovered after I’d finished admiring her. Though admiring was possibly too modest a word for what I’d been doing. She pulled the blankets up over her head, and I wrapped my arms around as she shivered. It took a few minutes, but she finally stopped shaking. She shifted around, pressing her back to my chest and poking her head out of the blankets, her cheek resting on my elbow.

“I think this is what it would feel like if I was sitting with my back against the side of the stove,” she murmured quietly, still a little sleepy, “Are all humans this warm?”

I smiled, “More or less, though human men are usually a bit warmer than human women,” I replied, as I dragged the fingers of my free hand lightly over her bare stomach.

“Oh, and how do I compare to a human woman?” She asked, in a dangerous tone.

“Mmm, you’re a little shorter, though the rest of you more than makes up for it,” I said, sliding my fingers up to tease at one nipple. She didn’t seem to mind too much, “What about me? How do I compare to an elf man?”

 “Ahh, you’re a little taller I guess,” she said, hunching her shoulders a little and turning pink. That was the first time I’d seen her blush at all, up till now she had seemed pretty comfortable with her sexuality.

“Hmm? I feel like there’s more you’re not telling me,” I taunted.

“Well I’ve never been with another elf before,” she said a little shyly.

*Uh oh*

“It’s not like that,” she said, feeling me tense up, “But what would you think would happen if I did take another elf to bed? I can’t have a child, I have a life to live. All the saving I’ve been doing is no good if some grubby man puts a baby in me. My parents would probably force me to marry him and I’m not going to spend the rest of my life barefoot and pregnant for some minor merchant. Once I have enough money I’m going to hop a ship to Nimre, just like you are, and learn the skills I need to support myself.”

I blinked, *Grubby? And she’s a Mage?*

“What?” She asked, turning awkwardly to look at me.

“Well,” I said hesitantly, not sure quite where to start. *Let’s start small,* ”Grubby?”

“Usually means not clean or dirty?” she said, a little sarcastically. She turned away from me again, snuggling in close. She grabbed my hand, which I’d let fall to the covers after being distracted by her remarks, and she held it to her chest. “Even when you were fresh from the road you didn’t smell too bad, and you actually washed properly when I asked you to, which I appreciate,” she said, sniffing at my hand.

“Do elves not bathe regularly?”

“Well yeah, just not regularly enough for my tastes. Mother says I shouldn’t be so prissy, but I have a hard time getting over the smell. I don’t think Mother knows quite why I’m so uptight about cleanliness though,” she said, pulling my hand up to her mouth, sucking lightly at each of my fingers in turn. “Most elves aren’t like me though, but most gnomes are thankfully, maybe a little gnome has rubbed off on me,” she said, giggling at her own dirty joke.

“Gnomes? The little green guys?” I asked, a little wryly.

“Don’t laugh,” she said sternly, “what else is there? Orcs are all raving lunatics, Giants are big and smelly and never wash, never ever. Another elf might just ruin my life if I’m unlucky, and dwarves aren’t around a whole lot. Gnomes come sometimes though,” and she giggled again.

“I bet they do.”

“I think you might have ruined me though,” she said, grimacing and crossing her legs, one hand on her lower abdomen.

“Did I…” I trailed off, not sure if I should feel bad or be **extremely** pleased with myself.

She elbowed me in the stomach, “Oh look at me,” she said, in a deep voice that I’m sure was supposed to mimic mine, “The big strong human, I’ve got such a big cock that when I have my way with a tiny little elf woman she breaks right in half.”

“That is… not what I was thinking.” I said, smiling widely.

*That is exactly was I was thinking.*

“I do feel rather sore down there though,” she said, and I could see her smirking a little, “I don’t think I’m going to find gnomes quite as satisfying as I did before you came along.”

“Why go through the trouble though? I mean, not to be indelicate, though I feel like we’re well past indelicate,” she did after all, have my middle finger all the way in her mouth, and I had an idea of where it would be going next, “But aren’t your parents still going to be royally pissed off if they find out you’ve been with anyone, whether it could get you pregnant or not?”

My finger came out of her mouth with a ‘pop’, “Yeah, but a girl has got to take care of herself. It’s no good to get all pent up and then let some boy put his hands all over you in a moment of weakness. Then you have to go to a special home for ‘women in a similar situation’. Nobles do the same thing when they can, both the men and the women, whole Adympian families make their business selling unique ‘toys’ to the very wealthy."

I stiffened a little at that, and not in an interesting fun time way.

She tilted her head to look up at me, “You hadn’t really considered it like that had you? I mean it’s not like that’s the only reason that Admypia likes slaves that come from Banestorms, but it’s definitely one of the reasons.”

“What, else, do they usually have slaves like that," *or me* "do?”

“Well I’ve never been to Admypia,” she said quietly, “but from what I’ve heard they do all the normal stuff that they have slaves do. Some are scribes, footmen, they’ll drive coaches, some will cook, though they don’t usually waste Outsiders on the menial tasks like farming or mining,” she said, making Outsider sound like a title or race, “But sometimes, they also make them do, other stuff…”

I suddenly had a better understanding of the sorts of sexual harassment scandals that I’d hear on the news. If you couldn’t find a willing partner, hard enough in a place with old world values, it often meant victimizing someone else to satisfy your own needs. These people didn’t even have the internet as an outlet. Now imagine the same scandal, except the sick old man in question has total control over the life of the young woman he’s victimizing, and knows that there will be no consequences for his actions. *A young woman like Thera… or Sila.* Though judging from what Thera said, I wasn’t immune to such exploitation either. Even here in Rhona, life must not be terribly great for women. A woman didn’t need to be a slave for some powerful noble to decide that the maid was going to take on ‘extra’ duties. And what would she do? If she turned down the advances then she might find herself without any other work, especially if the spurned nobleman put in a bad word with his friends. I’d been thinking, rather unfairly, that Thera was kind of vampish. And maybe she was, but I realized that this was her way of maintaining control over herself. The sass, the commanding attitude, making small requests that she expected to be fulfilled like bathing first. I thought that serving at one of the more common taverns might have been the worse job, needing to dodge the groping hands of drunk patrons, but it was probably no better here. The patrons here were probably just a little classier about how they went about things when they decided to satiate their appetites.

*And if life here is so shitty for women, then why the hell are you adding to it Quinn? You dropped Sila like a sack of potatoes as soon as you decided that she had nothing to offer you, even if she wasn’t the one, that could have been handled a hell of a lot more gracefully*

“Hey, what’s wrong?” Thera asked, twisting again to look at me, concern in her huge brown eyes, “Don’t worry Quinn, I’ll find you a ship, I promise.”

“I… I appreciate that, though that’s not what I was thinking about. I think I might have made a terrible mistake, and it’s one that I don’t think I’ll be able fix.”

Thera didn’t seem to know what to make of that, eyes searching mine, still clearly concerned about what was worrying me. After a moment though her expression became hungry, “I know just the thing to cheer you up,” she said, grip tightening on my hand, dragging it down between us.

“Hey- just hold on a secon-,” She kissed me deeply, cutting off my protestations, and I gave her what she wanted.

-----

“You are insatiable,” I said, a little while later. The sky had grown light while the two of us had been preoccupied.

It was a little warmer now, especially since we’d gotten each other pretty worked up, and she lay sprawled across my chest.

“I’m perfectly satiable, I’m just getting as much use out of you as I can before you leave for Nimre.”

“What am I, a piece of meat?” I asked, not sure if I should be insulted or gratified.

“Yeah, I’m only interested in you for your body,” she said, matter-of-factly, though I was pretty sure that she was only teasing.

“So you’re a Mage then?” I asked, wondering if she had any spells that I didn’t

“What? No, why would you think that?” she asked.

“Well you said that you were saving up to go to Nimre, didn’t you?”

“Yeah, but just because I’m going to-” She stopped suddenly, eyes growing wide, “You’re a Mage!”

“Maybe…” I said, lamely, “Why do you say that?”

“Oh come on-” she started to say.

“I did actually, remember? You had to run to the bathroom to rinse off,” I interrupted.

She thumped me hard on the chest with one petite fist, “Oh shut up,” she said, expression angry but holding back a laugh, “As I was saying, you thought I was going to Nimre to learn magic because that’s why you’re going there. I bet you didn’t even know that they taught anything else.”

“No I didn’t, is it the same school that teaches magic and non-magic stuff?”

“No, they’ve just got a lot of schools in Nimre. I mean, there’s schools here to. But if you’re a woman and want to learn something other than how to be a prim and proper wife Nimre is pretty much the only option.”

“Are they more egalitarian about the whole thing?”

She sighed heavily, wrapping her arms around me in a big hug, “Not really. But at least they’ll let me in.”

I stroked her hair, imagining how much worse it must have been for a woman my age to get dropped off in this world.

“I wish I was a Mage like you, then I might have a chance,” she said, seeming a little defeated.

“What do you mean? I imagine that you’ll face a hell of a lot of undeserved opposition, but I don’t think it’s hopeless.”

“Maybe,” she said, seeming a little unconvinced, “It’s just that it would be so much easier if I had magic. Aside from really boring stuff like sewing or baking or whatever else a good little girl is supposed to learn, magic is one of the only things that are seen as proper.”

“I suppose that makes some sense, but… Oh,” I said, realizing. Thera nodded her head a little, *show your work Quinn,* “And if they happen to be really good at it, I mean, really good, then they can do whatever the hell they want, can’t they?”

“Yeah, exactly. I was crushed when I first tried to get a mage stone to light up, and it just stayed dark,” *I know someone else like that, don’t I. Dammit.* “It was worse even, because it turned out that the first stone had already been used. I convinced myself that it was the only reason the stone didn’t light, and then it was even worse when I found a fresh stone.”

“Stones can’t be used more than once?” I asked, *Oh god dammit.*

“No, hold on, how do I know more about magic stuff than you?” She said, a little smug.

“Just answer the question,” I said, hands up in surrender.

“No, once a Mage or a Wizard gets the stone to light up it doesn’t work for anyone else. I spent weeks reading everything I could on them, hoping that there was some way I really was a Mage, but no. No magic for Thera.”

“What if a non-Mage trys to light one up, do you still have the stones?” I asked, I might yet be able to make some amends.

“Just the fresh one, but wouldn’t you already have your own?” she said, seeming confused.

“Yeah, but…” I let out a sigh, “It’s kinda complicated, but there’s someone I think deserves another shot at the whole ‘magic’ thing.”

I think my expression and general awkwardness about the situation might have given something away, but she didn’t push it. Instead she reached across me, going out of her way to shove her breasts in my face, to pick up a bracelet from the nightstand next to the bed.

“Here,” she said, dropping the bracelet into my hands, and propping herself up on my chest with an elbow.

It was the sort of bracelet that forms a single solid band when clasped together. It looked like it was made some simple metal, but plated with silver, though the silver had flaked off in places exposing the base metal underneath. At the bracelet’s centre was a single blue stone. Like my own mage stone this one looked initially like it was a piece of glass, though clearer than any of the glass I’d seen in use so far.

“It’s blue,” I said.

Thera looked at me like I was an idiot, “And?”

“I-“ I stammered out, and sighed. I reached over to where I’d left my rings, watch, and coin pouch, to grab the aluminum ring that held my own mage stone.

*I really hope my coin pouch isn’t any lighter now, than when I went to bed.*

“This one is mine,” I said, showing it to her, ”You’ll notice, it’s not blue.”

“Neither was the other one I had, it was green. From what I’ve read the colour doesn’t mean anything special. But, um…” she trailed off, looking at the bracelet I held in one hand.

“This thing is expensive.”

“Yeah,” she said, “I barely got any money back when I sold the first one, and this one was even more expensive.”

“Well, how much then?” I asked, “I’m not just going to ask you to give it to me, so how much do you want for it?”

She looked at me, mouth open slightly, thinking. Quite a few emotions flashed across her huge lavender eyes. I don’t think she could decide if I was serious, or if I was teasing her cruelly. She eventually settled on one emotion, anger.

“Now don’t you think for a second,” she said through gritted teeth, “that I’ll be your little plaything while you’re in Nimre just because you paid for me to be there.”

I think I hit a sore spot, I probably wasn’t the first guy to offer her the money she needed to get to Nimre, though most of them she probably hadn’t already taken to bed.

“Whoa, hold on,” I said soothingly, taking her hands in mine, “I’m going to pay you for the bracelet, I’m not paying you for anything else.”

She looked away from me, but didn’t pull her hands from mine. She finally spoke after a moment, and her voice was hoarse, “It’s just so hard Quinn. If I’d just accepted a tenth the offers I get, I wouldn’t even need to go to Nimre. I could live like a noblewoman right here in Myra if I was willing to whore myself out to horny old men. Having principles sucks.”

I stroked her hair, “I can help a little,” I said, “Let me pay you for the mage stone, it’s not like it’s cheap. I need to find one anyway, might as well get it from you.”

“That’s okay then I guess, who are you sending it to?”

“Uh, oh you know, just a friend of mine,” I said, about as smoothly as the surface of Mars.

“Fine, if you don’t want to tell me then don’t tell me. Why don’t you show me your magic then?”

“I thought I already did?” I said, with a cheesy grin.

She rolled her eyes, letting out a long suffering sigh, “Come on-“

I opened up my mouth to say something, but Thera realized her error and pounced, clamping her hands over my mouth before I could ask where.

“If I let you up, will you be good?” She taunted, straddling my chest.

I raised my hands in surrender, and she uncovered my mouth, though she didn’t get up.

“Are you going to show me or not?” She asked.

“Tonight, before we go to bed.” I answered.

“Tonight? You’re assuming that there will be a tonight,” she taunted, keeping the small smile off her face, “Why wait-“

I raised an eyebrow, and her eyes widened, “Oh, you know **that** kind of magic?” she said, very intrigued by this possibility, “Alright, I suppose that’s worth waiting for.”

She hopped off of me and stood up, stretching one side, then the other.

“Back to work?” I asked.

“No, I don’t need to be back until a bit after noon,” she said, as she bent down to gather up her clothes, “But I’ve got some errands to run before then.”

“Alright, I’ll see you then.”

She dressed, putting on her bracelet as well, and left. As soon as she was out the door I reached over and pulled open my coin pouch. It was, thankfully, still full. *I guess she didn’t really have anywhere to hide it, I did give her a pretty thorough cavity search after all.”

----

I got dressed eventually, after taking a bath. That was not a luxury I was going to have a week from now, whether I got a ship or not, and I intended to make the most of it. I stuffed my new spellbook in the pocket of my hoodie, which had been dropped off with the rest of my laundry just before I got in the bath. I eventually dragged myself downstairs to get something to eat for breakfast. None of the cooks seemed to know what pancakes were, and I resolved to teach the recipe to Thera. There was however, bacon, eggs, sausages, and fresh fruit, so it wasn’t all bad.

I took a seat in one of the comfy chairs by the fireplace and cracked open ‘Basic Illusion Magic’. I had wanted to jump right to the Basic Illusion spell, but there was a note at the top of the section saying that spellcasters should first know both Sound and Light before learning Basic Illusion so I did as it said. There was some preamble before the section that taught spells which explained the way that all illusion spells worked, but it seemed somehow incomplete. Much like ‘An Introduction to Practical Magic’ it seemed as if the book just failed to answer the sorts of basic follow up questions that anyone would ask after having the spells explained to them.

*Maybe it’s just my way of approaching a problem. Hell, I’ve probably spent more time in school than a lot of Mages my age or even older. Maybe they honestly don’t think of the same questions, though that does seem a rather arrogant assumption to make.*

I read over the descriptions of both spells before starting on the symbol memorization for sound, and I immediately saw some possibilities.

Sound apparently was the auditory counterpart to Light, and the two spells together formed the basis for illusion magic. It was much like light, for 1 mana per minute I got a relatively small effect. For light it was candlelight, for Sound it was a quiet sound, whispers, a buzzing insect, something like that. For 2 mana I got a large effect, for Light it was torchlight, for Sound it was anything between a whisper and a distant shout. Probably not enough to deafen someone if I set it off right near their ear, but I bet it would be surprising as hell. Voices were apparently not an option though, which did mean my ventriloquist act idea was unworkable.

Basic Illusion was the real prize though, this was something I could use on the road, as is, with no screwing around, to protect myself. I could make an illusory scene, ‘anything the caster may imagine’, with a volume of 1 cubic yard per mana I put into it. The preamble did mention that I couldn’t simply stretch out that 1 cubic yard into an impossibly thin sheet, but I had a decent amount of control over the dimensions, as long as the shape remained a rectangle of some sort. I could also move the illusion, though it mentioned that this took a great degree of concentration.

*I wonder if I can use this as a hacky invisibility spell, I guess it depends on how hard it is to move the illusion.*

I sat there for a while, learning Sound, and spinning my mana stone ring on my finger. That was another thing I’d need to test out, though probably not in the middle of an inn. I was already pushing it by reading the spell book in front of the fire, though unless you took a look inside the book it just seemed like any other, and I didn’t really want to draw more attention to myself.

# Chapter 14

I ate dinner late that night, not only did I have a hard time pulling myself away from my book, but waiting until later meant that I could eat dinner with Thera once she was done working. I wasn’t quite sure where I stood with her, but I hadn’t gotten robbed or stabbed to death in my sleep, so I wasn’t about to complain. I probably should have thought of the risks ahead of time, but a dry spell can only go on for so long before a man must take drastic, foolish action.

I’d finished teaching myself Sound by about midafternoon, which was consistent with how quickly I’d learned the other spells. So far it had taken me about eight to twelve hours to memorize a spell to the point where I could cast it without referring back to the book. Basic Illusion on the other hand seemed far more difficult, it might have just been me getting burnt out, but I felt like I should have been getting close at least. I’d started on Sound around seven in the morning, and finished around three in the afternoon. After getting the spell straight in my head I’d experimented with it a bit before having a very late lunch. I relaxed and gambled a bit with a few of the merchants still in the inn, but I started on Basic Illusion by about four. But it was all of six hours later and I still didn’t feel like I was even close to learning the spell.

I stretched my sore muscles, aside from my break and seeing to some basic necessities, I’d barely moved from the chair since this morning.

*Might just be that I’m rushing. I doubt that elf mages sit down and inhale a spell book over the course of a single day.*

I stuck the book into the front pocket of my hoodie and got up, a little unsteadily after being seated for so long, and went over to where Thera had just finished wiping down the bar.

“Hungry?” She asked in her bedroom voice, as I sat down across from her.

“Yeah,” I said, casting a look at a pair of dishes keeping warm in the oven.

“Do you also want something to eat?”

I laughed, “You are incorrigible.”

“I don’t know what incorrigible means, but it had better be flattering,” she said, getting out the meals she’d been saving for the two of us.

*Fish again, these guys eat a hell of a lot of fish. Maybe they’re not ‘city’ elves, ‘sea’ elves might be a better description. Especially if I’m right about the whole Greeco-Roman thing.*

“You know, you’re an odd one Quinn”

I raised an eyebrow, “You mean aside from the fact that I might be the only human in the world?”

She bit a her lower lip again, “Well it’s just that,” she hesitated, leaning forwards onto the bar, giving me a good look down the front of her dress, “I saw you talking and playing cards with those merchants. You talk like someone who’s actually seen a bit of the world, you even seemed to understand what that Ninsil family merchant was saying when he started going on about tariffs. And the way you were playing, I’ve seen plenty of gamblers come through here Quinn, and you were definitely sharping them.”

“You disapprove?” I asked, unsure. Despite her vampishness I didn’t think that Thera was a bad person, and she might not like it if she thought I was cheating at cards.

“No, it’s not like those men are going to miss their money. It’s just that you can do all that stuff, talk and gamble like you belong at a table with men like that, but then you turn around and act as naive as a child.”

“What?” I frowned, “What do you mean?”

“Did you consider, even for a second, that I might have been bedding you just so I could steal your purse and fancy rings? I could have just been taking advantage of you.”

“Yes,” I said, with conviction, “Well, after you left, yeah,” I finished, with less conviction.

She rolled her eyes, throwing up her hands, “You’re hopeless.”

“I was simply distracted by your unearthly beauty,” I said haughtily.

She gave me a flat look.

“What? I thought you liked flattery?”

She rolled her eyes again, sighing and unclasping her bracelet and dangling it negligently from one hand, “Do you still want this thing?” she asked, a little exasperated.

“Certainly, how much do you want for it?” I asked.

“Do you even know what this thing is worth? For all you know I could be taking advantage of you so I can pay for tuition in Nimre,” she said, seeming slightly annoyed.

*It was only fifty drachm for the book and the stone together, can’t be too expensive for just the one.*

“One hundred drachm,” I said.

She narrowed her eyes, “Quinn…”

“Yes?”

“You do understand how bartering works, right? Usually you start a little low, but not too low, and I start a little high, but not too high. Then we negotiate to somewhere in the middle, understand?”

“Fine, fine, I see how it is,” I said, nodding along with her explanation, “One hundred and fifty then?”

“Can you just lean over here please?” She asked, balling up one fist and narrowing her eyes.

“Threats now? Fine, but I can’t go any higher than two-“

She let out a defeated sigh, and put her head down on the bar, asking “You know that we’ve only known each other since lunch yesterday? You know that the stone is worth only a tenth of that. Why do this for me?”

*I don’t know, maybe I’m trying to make this world a little less terrible for young women in the small way that I can, maybe I found your story particularly sympathetic. Maybe I’m just an idiot.*

“Just think of it as taking advantage of me.” I provided.

She lifted her head to look at me, “Fine. But don’t think I’m going to sleep with you again just because you’re paying me.*

*Aw, dammit…*

“I’m only doing it because there’s literally no one else, and you promised to show me what you could do with magic.”

*Good, I guess?*

-----

Thera was a very eager research assistant. I’d imagine a new shape for the manipulators that Apportation created, and Thera would provide me with immediate feedback on their effectiveness. It’s amazing what you can do with five or six pairs of hands, and, other things.

“I always thought that mages would be boring old men sitting in dingy libraries reading dusty old tomes,” She said, a while later as we lay tangled in each other’s arms, “This is much more fun.”

“Mmm, I’m glad you enjoyed it. But I’m pretty sure I’m going to end up doing a lot reading when I get to Nimre though, not that I mind.”

She snuggled closer to my chest, it was late, and despite the warm climate it still got rather cold at night, “I could tell, you had just sat down to start reading when I left, and you were still reading when I got back. Did you get up at all while I was gone?”

“Uh, got up to go to the bathroom I think.”

“Ugh,” She said with exaggerated disgust, slapping me on the side, “How do you even do that?”

“Well usually I start by undoing my belt-“ she slapped me in the ribs again, “Ooof- Fine, what do you mean? You can read, I’ve even seen you reading sometimes when there’s not a lot of customers around.”

“Sure, but I don’t just sit there and do it all day. This is just like you, you’re really sharp, and somehow also really naïve. You’re really boring, but somehow you can also sit down at a gambling table and clean out all the men there. I don’t know why you decided to come here, you should be spending the week in some gambling den, then you’d have **two** women of questionable morals hanging off your arm and trying to get money out of you.”

I laughed, “One is plenty.”

She pulled back a little to give me a dangerous look.

“One very beautiful woman of questionable morals who I need to browbeat into taking my money?”

She snuggled back up to me, “You’re really not very good at flattery, are you?”

“I do my best.”

“What about the cards though, where did you learn to play like that?”

“Oh, even that involves sitting in libraries reading books,” I said, trying to explain the internet would take all night, “I didn’t actually cheat either, it was mostly just statistics.”

“Statistics?”

“Well,” I started, *how do I explain statistics, and not sound like the boringest boring person in the world,* “In the world I come from people have enough free time on their hands, and they take games seriously enough, that people will study a game like a Mage might study magic. I had plenty of time when I was waiting for the pass south to clear, so I spent some time pulling the rules apart, figuring out the probability of any given hand. The other players might have a gut feeling as to how probable a given hand is, but I know the figures exactly. I'll also try to keep track of what cards I've seen played already. Between that, and having worked out the probabilities of each, I usually have at least an idea of how good my hand is compared to the others.”

“Wait,” she said, trying to wrap her head around what I’d just said, “So, you know what cards they have in their hand?”

“Not quite, I know what cards they **probably** have. And even if I don’t know specifics, I’ll at least have an idea of whether their hand is better or worse than mine, and that’s really all I need.”

“Don’t humans have anything better to do?”

I thought of the many hundreds of hours spent playing videogames and watching Netflix.

“Nope.”

-----

I went out to find a messenger the following morning, Thera having pointed me in the right direction. She had the morning off like usual, and it looked like she wanted to ask if I wanted her along, but she seemed to recognize that I’d rather do this alone. I had turned it over in my head a few times, trying to do this properly, while minimizing the amount of hurt I inflicted on Sila. I had considered actually heading back and handing over the bracelet in person, but I didn’t think that would end well. I wouldn’t even know how to begin that conversation, let alone how to end it. Showing up out of the blue after she’d accepted the fact that I was leaving would be bad enough. But then what? If it still doesn’t light up I’d just be raising her up, to cast her back down again. The odds definitely favoured that outcome, I was not going to walk back there for the fifty to one shot that she had magic, when I’d just hurt her again if she didn’t.

I stopped outside the little storefront that the messenger business was run out of, and I drew out the bracelet, inspecting it. It was pretty beat up, the blue mage stone looked fine, but the rest of the bracelet looked rather shoddy. It was made of some base metal, pewter, tin, something like that, but plated with silver. It was the silver plating that was in rough shape, and the sections that hadn’t flaked off were badly tarnished.

*Not a great ‘Sorry I’m sleeping with someone else’ gift.*

I turned around, and headed for one of the lower end jewellers that I’d seen when looking for a place to sell my dice. I could go back to the place where I’d sold the aluminum, but such fancy jewellers weren’t the sorts of places that sold or worked on budget items like the bracelet. I found the store I’d been looking for and left the bracelet with them to be fixed up. It cost me a little extra to have it done by the following evening, but I didn’t know quite when I’d be leaving. If Thera told me that there was a ship heading out for Nimre tomorrow then I was probably going to be on it, and I didn’t want to be waiting around for the bracelet to be finished.

-----

I got back to the inn at lunchtime, and decided to keep plugging away at Basic Illusion. I had gone up to my room to retrieve the book when I heard someone knock lightly on the door, I turned to see Thera slipping inside.

“Progress!” I proclaimed.

Thera gave me a very strange look.

“Well I just don’t think you’ve ever bothered knocking before, usually you just barge in and throw yourself down on my bed,” I taunted.

“Oh, is that what you think I’m like?” She asked, taking deliberate steps towards me.

*Uh oh.*

“I think,” I started, in my Quinn-covers-his-ass-voice “That you’re a strong and independent woman, who knows what she likes and takes steps to get it on her terms.”

She sighed, shaking her head and laughing a little, “Fine. You’re not getting any right now though, I need to get to work in a minute. I just came up to let you know that I’ve found a ship for you, maybe for me aswell.”

“Oh?” I asked, not quite sure where this was going.

“Well there’s a ship leaving next Feastday, it’s a small mail carrier, but it has space for a passenger or two and should make the journey quickly. The next one after that is a cargo ship running fresh fruit, so it’ll also make the journey pretty quickly. There are a couple other ships, but they’ll be a bit later in the season. I, uh, think the mail carrier works pretty well for you,” she said, seeming a little awkward.

“And you’d take the cargo ship?” I asked, seeing where this was going, “I guess you’ve got enough now for passage and tuition?”

“Yeah, I mean, it’s not that I don’t enjoy your company Quinn. It’s just…” she trailed off.

“Hey, I get it.” I said congenially.

“You do?” She asked, hopefully.

*Yeah, hurts a little more than I thought it would, but yeah.*

“Yeah,” I said, not quite sadly.

She stepped up to me, jabbing a finger into my chest, “You’re still mine until Feastday though, understand? You go off to some gambling den like I said and I’ll kick your ass.”

I frowned, “Thanks, I guess?”

“You’re welcome,” she said, “The captain of the mail carrier wants 100 drachm, so that’s another reason not to go off gambling.”

She got up on tiptoe, grabbing me by the hair with one hand, to pull me down into a quick kiss, “Oh, and you might want to make sure to have your little illusion spell all finished up by tonight,” she whispered into my ear.

*What?*

“What?” I asked, as she let go.

“It’ll be a surprise,” she said, and there was a truly evil grin on her face as she slipped out of the room to get to work.

*Uh oh*

-----

I stayed in my room rather than venturing downstairs, I wasn’t sure what Thera had planned, but I wanted to be prepared so I wasn’t about to risk getting distracted. I should have known there would be trouble when I first told her about the spell, her eyes lit up like she with child-like wonder, except eviler. Especially when I mentioned that it might be possible to use the spell to turn someone invisible. *This might be a terrible idea.* I went ahead with my studies though, trusting that I had the self-control to say no if it seemed like she was going to try to coerce me into doing something I shouldn’t. *Is this the long con? But I didn’t even tell her about Basic Illusion until I started ‘testing’ some of my spells on her.*

It took me some time, about twice as long as it had for the beginner spells, but I eventually got to the point where I could cast Basic Illusion. The first thing I tried to do with the spell was break it. The book had mentioned that there was a limit to how much you could stretch the 1 cubic yard of volume, but hadn’t given any specifics beyond mentioning that I couldn’t make it infinitely thin, and infinitely tall. I cast the spell, imagining a big stone cube floating in the air. It looked like a cubic yard of stone at least, but then I didn’t really have any way to measure it. I tried stretching it and bending the outer boundaries of the spell into different shapes, cubes and spheres were apparently fine, but if I tried anything more complicated I just ended up with whichever of the two was closer. I could stretch the shape into an ellipsoid or a rectangle, and I used bits of twine to measure just how much I could stretch it. The cube itself must have been 3 feet to a side so I used that as the baseline of my very professional twine-based measuring system. I didn’t have exact figures, but it looked like I could stretch the illusion into a rectangle that was a little less than one foot deep, three and a half feet wide, and a little over 8 feet tall.

*So I guess I should have enough space to make an illusion of a person then?*

I tried just that, imagining myself standing where the stone block was. It worked! Though it was incredibly unnerving. I’d been expecting something fuzzy, or with sharper angles, something that looked more like a character model from the early 2000s than something from the holodeck. Instead, there I was. Same dark blue jeans, same dark blue hoodie, same burgundy t-shirt just peeking out at the collar. Not a hair was out of place, hell, I could even see individual pores. It was me, but perfectly still. The stillness made it look wrong, it wasn’t still like any person could ever be, it was still like a corpse. I dispelled the thing almost immediately, just looking at it made my adrenaline spike and my heart race. I’d half expected it to leap at me screaming like something out of a horror movie, and I couldn’t shake the feeling of wrongness, even after it was gone. I fell back onto the bed, staring up at the ceiling.

*Let’s work on literally anything else, like that magic ring I bought.*

If the shopkeeper I’d bought it from hadn’t been lying then the two smaller stones embedded in it each held one mana, and the larger one held two mana. I should be able to draw on both of those reserves to cast my spells, which would help a lot with what I figured was a very limited mana reserve.

*Hell, if my mana regeneration is so high then maybe I just need a bunch of magical bling.*

Before I’d gotten Basic Illusion working I had used Apportation to gauge my personal mana reserves, but that required heavy stuff to lift, and for the test to be worth anything I needed an approximation of what the stuff weighed. With Basic Illusion on the other hand I could tell how much power I was using just from the size of the cube I could make… yeah, I’d stick to cubes for now.

*Well the ring holds four mana, and I’ve got one, so five cubic yards?*

I cast the spell, getting nothing for my trouble. I knew by now what it felt like to cast a spell and then lose it, and what it felt like to cast a spell and have it fail altogether. This was what failure felt like. I tried again with four cubic yards, and I also got nothing. Three cubic yards worked just fine though, and I felt something change in the ring. Looking at it, I was sure that nothing looked different than before, but the stone in the centre **felt** dimmer. *I guess I’ve emptied the stone?* This was confirmed for me about a minute later when the spell ended and the illusion disappeared. I tried again with two cubic yards, which also worked, and again, one of the stones **felt** dimmer. About a minute after that the other stone went dim as well, and about a minute after that the spell lapsed, stone block disappearing. It looked strange, having a multi-ton boulder pop in and out of existience. I almost expected there to be some sort of sound when the block appeared, or maybe I’d feel some movement in the air. There was nothing like that though, if I’d had my eyes closed then I would have had no idea that the boulder was even there. Though that was rather the point I supposed, it was after all, an illusion.

*So I can only draw on one of these stones at a time. Not great, but it’s an improvement at least.*

I figured that I had a little time to experiment further before Thera would show up and drag me off to do something foolish, so I experimented with charging the mana stone. I had no luck, I tried treating mana stones like the mage stone, trying to ‘push’ on it, but I got nowhere. Fifteen minutes later Thera slipped into the room, and fifteen minutes later the stones were still empty.

“Ready?” She asked, with that evil smile again.

“For what exactly?” I asked, “And why do I get the feeling that whatever you want me to help you with is not the sort of thing that a proper young lady and proper young man should be doing?”

She looked like she was about to answer, but instead she just grinned evilly, biting at her lower lip.

“I’m not going to like this at all am I?” I asked.

“Oh, I don’t know.”

*Oh, I am fucked.*

-----

And as it turned out, I was exactly right.

# Chapter 15

I was exhausted, and could hear my ribs creaking under the enormous pressure, I was sure that something was going to break. Thera suddenly choked out a short, high scream, before crumpling forwards bonelessly. It was suddenly deathly quiet, and after gathering my strength I shoved Thera off of me and to the side.

“Mhmm, I hope none of neighbours heard us,” she panted from where she lay on the bed.

“Well they certainly didn’t hear me,” I said dryly.

-----

Getting into Thera’s house had not been easy. She lived with her family in a nicer part of town, in an area that reminded me more of Victorian brownstones than some Greco-Roman domus. According to Thera she had the house to herself for the time being, *ayy baby*, but she was apparently expected to head back home once she finished up at the inn. Something that she hadn’t been doing the past couple of days. She told me about ‘Goodwife Prisa’, who she just called Miss Priss. Miss Priss lived across the street and had apperantly been set the task of watching for Thera as she came home by Thera’s mother. It was Miss Priss’s job then to make sure that Thera wasn’t doing something like… staying at the inn to sleep with strange men.

“I can usually get away with telling her that I did walk home while she wasn’t watching, but if she sees a big scary giant going into my house she’ll probably notice that something’s up,” she had told me.

This was why Thera was so interested in the applications of Basic Illusion, according to her she’d never been able to sneak any of her… friends… by Miss Priss’s observations, and she was very eager to finally have someone in her own bed. Luckily I was able to use the spell I’d learned to make myself invisible, but it was very far from perfect. I could use the volume the spell gave me to make a sort of ‘hide’ which would render me invisible while I was inside of the spell’s footprint. The trouble was moving the hide once it was in place. I could make an illusion of a person and have them walk around, but it took a surprising amount of mental effort, enough that I had a hard time moving the spell and walking at the same time. This meant that while I had my little invisibility cloak, I had to move at a snail’s pace to keep the spell together. Thera had a coach pick her up from the inn and was home in less than ten minutes. With the spell on it took me that long just to walk from the intersection where her street met the main thoroughfare, to her front door. I managed to use the spell to mask the front door opening as I entered though, which I suppose does solve one of the major hurdles when it comes to invisibility.

-----

“What are you doing?” Asked Thera a little sleepily, as she stepped into the kitchen. She was wearing only my sweater, which was a look I rather liked.

“Cooking breakfast?”

“I’m impressed that nothing’s on fire,” she teased, “It doesn’t even look like you’ve burnt any of the food.”

“Hey! What’s that supposed to mean?” I asked, a little indignantly.

“Well, it’s just strange to have a man cooking for me. It’s actually kind of sweet.”

“What, do elven men just not cook?” I asked, *I suppose that fits with the Victorian/Greco-Roman theme that this world seems to follow.*

“Some, but only if it’s their job. Cooks cook, and some innkeepers might man the stove once in a while, but there’s no way father would ever cook for us. Mother or one of the servants is always expected to do the cooking.”

“Uhh, servants?” I asked, flipping the pancakes.

“Don’t worry,” she said, giggling a little as she saw my expression, “No one’s going to walk in on us. I’m pretty sure that one of the servants would have heard us if they were here last night.”

“Hear you, you mean” I protested, as I dished the pancakes. There was no maple syrup, but I made do with peanut butter and some preserves.

“Oh, did I embarrass you?” She teased, “I’ve always got to be so quiet when I’m back at the inn. I think that was the first time I’d really been able to let myself go. What’s this?” She asked, changing the subject.

“Pancakes!”

-----

Leaving the house ended up being more difficult than entering it, and that didn’t even include Thera tackling me when I tried to leave before she had quite finished with me. When I’d snuck in late last night the street had been empty, so I hadn’t needed to worry about someone bumping into me as I tiptoed down the street. This was not the case in the morning as people were heading out to start the day. It took some time, and it was a little nerve-wracking, but I managed to get to the end of the street. Basic Illusion redeemed itself though, when I realized that I’d need to find some way to pop into view on a somewhat busy street corner. I set up the illusion so that from the point of view of anyone behind me, there was simply an empty street. From the view of those walking down the street though they just saw me step around the corner and keep on walking. It wasn’t foolproof, but on the other hand most people were too busy with their own lives to really pay attention to the little inconsistencies in my illusion.

I had originally planned on walking around a little, maybe find what passed for a church or temple here in Rhona, but the stares I was getting quickly changed my mind. It made me feel a little self-conscious, and while no one was going to stop me and tell me I couldn’t just walk around the city, I still felt rather awkward drawing so much attention. Instead I found one of the bookstores I’d been by earlier, and I poked around looking for a book on local religions. A book was probably a better option than stumbling around if I wanted some idea of the local religious beliefs anyway. I was not a particularly devout person, but I figured that I should probably have some idea of other people’s beliefs, it would be very easy for me to end up in trouble if I made some religious gaffe.

I found a simple primer on the local religions, and headed back to The Anchor Chain to read. Aside from a bit of gambling, the book would give me something to do other than Thera. I realized, as I sat down in one of the comfy chairs by the fire, that I was really going to miss Thera. Our attraction had been almost entirely physical, and probably wouldn’t ever have become more than that, but I enjoyed her company and she was fun to talk to.

*Well, hopefully I’ll see her again once we’ve both made it to Nimre, even if we’re not going to pick up where we left off.*

I flipped through the book, finding that Rhona and the rest of Eladria seemed to have a pantheistic religious structure, *like any good D&D campaign world,* though there seemed to be some overlap between the different deities. There wasn’t just one ‘God of Law’ for example, instead there were a few deities that each claimed some amount of dominion over Law. This held true in most other areas, there was more than one god of the sea mentioned, more than one god of magic. From what I read there was as much competition between the rival gods within one dominions as there was between them and the gods that opposed their dominion in some way. One particularly interesting deity I found was Verrin, a goddess of feminine pleasure and dominance, *Thera must be a* ***very*** *devout follower.*

I wasn’t lucky enough to find a simple list of ‘Stuff That Offends People’ though, and with such a mess of competing religious beliefs what might offend one group would be seen as perfectly fine by another.

Instead I paid particular attention to gods that claimed some dominion over the sea. I found a few, though the text mentioned that there were several more that weren’t listed and that these were just the three most common. There was Okeanis who claimed, or his followers claimed, dominion over merchants and seagoing trade. There was Sakana, a goddess of the ‘Ocean’s Bounty’, and judging from the illustration that accompanied the passage she was **very** bountiful. Lastly there was Mar, god of sailors and naval warfare, and in addition to that he apparently also had some claim over the dead. It was written that he was responsible for the souls of all who perished at sea.

I guessed that the captain of the mail carrier would be a follower of Okeanis, if he was religious at all, but since the text really only gave a brief overview of many gods I still only had a general idea of how a devout follower of Okeanis might behave. I sighed, it had been a good idea at least. I did need some idea of the social norms and cultural mores of this world, after all, really all I knew about elves was that they were about as sexist as humans were at this point in history. Not a big surprise.

-----

I ate lunch at The Anchor Chain, but went out again in the afternoon to get the refurbished bracelet from the jeweller. I was pleased with the work, and aside from the weight it looked might have been made wholly of silver. The blue stone complemented the silver finish well, and I paid the man for his work, leaving a nice tip. I still wasn’t entirely sure that elves tipped, but so far no one had been surprised when I’d done it, so I wasn’t about to stop. *It’s like a bribe, except classier.*

I’d written a letter to Sila explaining the reason for the gift, mainly outlining that the previous mage stone wouldn’t have lit whether she was a mage or not. I tried not to get her hopes up, but I gave her a brief run through of how the meditation would go, it had been some time after all since she’d last tried it. I wasn’t really sure if I wanted her to be a mage or not, but it seemed only fair to give her a chance. On the one hand I might find it rather awkward to have her with me at the school, but on the other hand, if she had magic there would be a whole world of new possibilities opened up to her. I knew that I’d gotten beyond any romantic feelings for her when she first tried to hop into bed with me, but she had still been a very good friend, and I wanted her to do well. *I guess we’ll see, won’t we.*

-----

Two short days later I was walking up the gangplank onto the ship that would take me to Nimre. Thera had come to see me off, and to make sure that everything went smoothly with the captain. I hadn’t met him before today, and Thera was kind enough to make the introductions for me. She’d certainly put me through the wringer over the last couple of days, protesting that she’d expected to have me for a whole week, so she wasn’t about to let me get off easy just because I was leaving a little earlier than expected. I wasn’t one for long goodbyes, and thankfully neither was Thera. She’d given me a quick peck on the cheek and I’d boarded the ship, we’d done the real goodbyes the night before after all.

The gangplank was pulled up, and the ship cast off. I waved as the sails caught the wind and the ship was pulled out to sea. I could see Thera waving as well, before she hurried off back to The Anchor Chain. She would be leaving on her own lengthy voyage a week from now, and had a lot to take care of before then.

I stayed up on the deck as the small mail carrier started to pick up speed. I had no frame of reference for how fast a fast ship was, but the captain had told me that the trip would take about twenty days. It was about five thousand miles over land to Nimre, probably a bit more by sea, so the ship was probably moving at ten or eleven miles an hour. I wasn’t terribly impressed by this, but apparently that was very good time for the run from Myra to Nimre. Cargo ships, like the one Thera would take, would apparently do the journey in as many as fifty days.

The captain, a man named Enutur, came down to speak with me once we were well underway. He was a portly man, roughly five feet tall, and dressed a little gaudily. He wore a red tunic, with a darkish yellow braid along the edges. It seemed as if he was trying to pass it off as cloth-of-gold, and he honestly wasn’t doing a terrible job of it. A similar dark yellow braid tied the tunic at the waist, and his legs were bare below the knee. He definitely fit the Greco-Roman aesthetic, which set him apart from most of the elves on the coast who seemed to have a little more Victorian influence.

*Some of what’s making it hard to adapt is probably my trying to understand everything with the lens of historical Europe, I’d probably have a lot better handle on things if I tried to look at this world on its own merits. After all, as far as I knew there wasn’t going to be a whole lot of influence from Earth, I might very well be the only human on the planet.*

“Aye, you look like you’re a little far from home,” he said, by way of greeting.

“Yeah, you could say that,” I said dryly.

“Banestorm?” He asked.

*Everyone just seems to take it for granted. Strange creature dropped out of the sky from a different and exotic world? Happens all the time.*

“Yup.”

“Been here long?” He asked.

“Ah,” I looked down at my watch, which told me it was June 4th,”Six months, four days.”

“Really, and that thing keeps track for you?” He asked, looking at my watch.

“Yeah, you’ve got a clock on board don’t you? This thing is just a miniature version of that,” I explained.

“We don’t have a clock, but I know what you mean. Must be awfully advanced where you come from, what did you do before you came here?” He asked, though it felt a little more like an interrogation.

*He recognizes that some worlds are more advanced, hell, I bet that’s the reason for the somewhat messy distribution of technology here. You get the odd Outsider from a world a little bit ahead, and to make a name for themselves they introduce a little bit of their world’s technology.*

“I was a mathematician,” I said, which was close enough to the truth, “Why the interest?”

“Oh, you know, you hear about Outsiders all the time, but when do you ever get to meet one?”

“Well,” I pondered, “So far everyone **I’ve** met is an Outsider.”

“I suppose they are, what are you called anyway? Are all the people from your world as big as you?” He asked. I did definitely feel like he was prying a little, but on the other hand he seemed motivated mainly by curiosity. Being on the captain’s good side was probably a smart idea anyway, so I played along.

“I’m a human,” I explained, ”Though no, most humans aren’t quite as tall as me. I’m a bit slimmer, and a lot taller than most humans. The average human man is something like five foot nine, and the average woman about five foot four. So the average human woman is about as tall as the tallest elves I’ve met.”

“Hmm,” he considered, “You said you were a mathematician, is that why you’re going to Nimre? Going to try to teach at one of the universities?”

*Probably best not to tell him you’re a Mage.*

“Yeah, I’m pretty sure I can show the professors there a thing or two. I noticed that your numbering system could use some work, it reminds me of roman numerals, and there seems to be no concept of zero.”

“Uh, what do you mean?” He asked, confused.

“Well it’s complicated,” I said, understating the problem, “But the numbering system I’ve seen used so far is kind of limited, it’s much easier to do more complicated operations with a positional system. I think calculus and even algebra are areas of math that might not even exist here, at least as far as I’ve seen.”

I was pretty sure I’d lost him somewhere along the way, but he was nodding along encouragingly.

“Well, that’s all very interesting,” he said, not terribly interested, “Why don’t I show you to your room so you can put your things away. Is that all you have?” He asked, nodding towards my bag and the bundle of books I’d collected in the past couple days.

“Yeah, I didn’t arrive here with a whole lot in the first place.”

-----

He showed me below decks to an empty room that looked like it might have been meant for cargo, though no cargo was present. It was somewhat uncomfortable below decks, since the ceiling *bulkhead? Or is a wall a bulkhead?* was only about five feet up. The lightly rocking ship didn’t make me feel any better in the cramped confines of the ship

“I’ll have to get a bed brought in for you…” he trailed off, looking at how I was hunched over in the empty room, “Um…”

“Why don’t I just string my hammock between some of these hooks, they’re meant for cargo aren’t they? They should be able to take my weight,” I said, gesturing at some of the cargo hooks along the wall.

“Ah, they should be able to. But what’s a hammock?” He asked.

“I’ll show you,” I said, taking the hammock out of my bag and stringing it between the two opposite walls. I pulled myself up into the hammock once I had it set up, luxuriating in the Quinn-sized sleeping accommodations.

“I suppose that works,” he remarked.

“Don’t most sailors sleep in hammocks?” I asked, slipping out of the hammock and onto the floor. *deck?*

“No, I’ve never seen one of these before,” he said, considering my creation.

“Well here’s an idea you can have for free,” I offered, “Where I’m from hammocks were used by sailors as a place to sleep for hundreds of years. They move with the ship so it’s easier to sleep in rough seas, it’s awfully hard to get thrown out of one, and they pack up small. You could even string these above your cargo, letting you carry more, rather than have some floor space taken up by beds.”

He was nodding, thoughtful, “That is very clever, I’ll have to get some made once we reach Nimre. It’s just rope netting?” He asked.

“Well, you can use anything really. This one’s just knotted ropes so it stands up to the wilderness better, but the hammocks used by sailors were made out of sheets of cloth instead since it’s a bit more comfortable.”

He clapped me on the shoulder, “Well if you get tired of your books you’re welcome to join me and the crew in the galley for cards and dice ‘round supper time.”

“That’s awfully kind of you,” I said, glad for the chance to recoup some of the costs of the voyage.

-----

I had explained pancakes to the cook fairly early on. One downside to a non-stop voyage like the mail carrier did was that they didn’t get the chance to resupply during the trip. Now they certainly had the space to carry plenty of food, but some things just don’t keep for that long, so as the journey wore on the food would get worse. This meant that for the last week or so of the journey it would be dried meat and hardtack for everyone. Unless of course, someone introduced them to the most Canadian of cuisine, pancakes! Well, crepes, which are sort of French, but then Canada is sort of French. Most of the ingredients you needed to make proper pancakes wouldn’t keep any longer than the rest of their food, but crepes weren’t too difficult to make with what was at hand. There was even some peanut butter, which they normally used along with some of their other condiments and seasonings to make the hardtack edible.

My improvements made the food later in the journey, if not great, at least okay. But I started to notice something in the crew, especially the younger crew, as we got closer to Nimre. As the good food stores started to run out and we ended up eating more of the food I’d taught to the cook I noticed that, aside from the captain, most of the crew seemed not to finish most of what the cook made. They all assured me and the cook that this was much better than their normal fare and that they were glad for the better food, but much of it was left uneaten. I’d thought that it simply became a bit of a slog. Crepes with peanut butter and dried meat on the side three times a day for over a week gets rather boring. So it made perfect sense that they wouldn’t have much of an appetite. This was not the reason, and if I’d been more of a people person I might have figured out what was going on ahead of time. As it was, I didn’t figure it out, and things did not go well.

-----

I was up on the deck reading one of the books I’d bought before leaving Myra while leaning over the railing that faced the open ocean. We’d been making good time, and there were only two days left in the journey. One upside to such a simple ship was that it could be run with a relatively small crew. Between that and the ample space for crew accommodations and food the ship was able to fit a whole second shift, which let the ship travel just fine through the night. We were a little more than five hundred miles from Nimre, and maybe a few hours from the border between Admypia and Ashur when I noticed that we’d slowed nearly to a stop. I looked around, and caught the eye of a crewmen that had just climbed down the mast, and I saw the guilty look in his eyes before he scurried into the captain’s cabin.

*Oh god dammit.*

I scanned the deck of the ship, but saw that aside from the man who’d just climbed down the mast the deck was empty except for the helmsman. Looking across the deck of the ship I could see the shore a few miles distant, but between the ship and the shore was an Admypian Trireme, and it was already damned close. From the mast flew two banners, the one above was the Admypian Ensign, and the one below was the house flag of some Admypian merchant family. This gave me a thought, and I looked up to the mast of my own ship. What do you know? There was a third banner flying there. There was the Rhonan Ensign and the house flag of the family Enutur worked for, which I’d expected, but there was also a solid red flag with a triangular notch cut out of the end of it.

*Hmm, do I have time to kill Enutur before they show up?*

I looked towards the captain’s cabin, to see Enutur and three crewmen step onto the deck. The crew looked rather abashed, though Enutur was clearly making an effort to remain expressionless. He shouted something, and some more crewmen made their way up from below decks. The cowards wouldn’t even look at me as they prepared receive the Admypian ship. The crew that had come out of the captain’s cabin stuck with Enutur though, I guess Enutur had realized that I might have some objections to his business arrangement.

I forced myself to relax, leaning against the railing *bulwark?* and putting on a false air of confidence. I did a mental inventory, and I didn’t come up with a very large list, most of my stuff was below decks and wouldn’t be useful in the first place. I had one of my four colour pens, the nicer of my two multitools, the folding knife, my watch, my rings, and my jacket. Oh, and one book on Nimrean history.

*And in my pack below decks is a spellbook that will damn me if found.*

I ran through my options as quickly as I could, knowing that the second the Admypians boarded the list would get a lot shorter. I didn’t come up with many escape plans. In fact, I came up with only one, and it was really terrible.

I stayed where I was, leaning against the rail *unless it’s a bulwark* and waited as the Admypian ship pulled up alongside. I unzipped the front pocket of my coat, slipping my glasses inside as I watched while ropes were tied off on both ships. A gangplank was laid across the narrow gap left between the ships, and five men walked across. Now the Admypians looked Roman, no Greco- about it. The man, or should I say elf, at their head wore what looked just like the Roman armour I’d seen on the History channel. He had the stereotypical Roman helmet, though it had no plume, and the segmented plate armour that I was sure was called Lorica Sement-somthingorother. Except for the too-large eyes he was the very model of a Roman soldier. *Oh, he’ll do very nicely.* The other four wore the same Roman style of helmet as their leader, but had mail on instead of the heavier plate armour. It was probably lighter and easier to get out of, since swimming in that plate armour was probably not fun at all.

I saw the leader look dismissively towards Enutur, before approaching me with the other four soldiers in tow.

“Hi,” I said, with exaggerated friendliness.

The leader blinked at this, he was probably expecting more screaming, shouting, and crying, “Why hello there, I don’t suppose you’re going to come peacefully?” He asked with equally exaggerated friendliness, “I’d really rather not damage you.”

“Sure thing,” I said cheerfully, “Just one thing before I go though, I need to get a refund.”

“What?” The leader said, seeming rather confused.

“Enutur, he said he’d take me to Nimre, and I paid him 100 drachm for the trouble. Now I find out that he’s not going to take me the whole way? Worse still he’s trying to sell me into slavery! Preposterous, I demand a refund.” I said indignantly, I even stamped a foot.

The leader opened his mouth to speak, but didn’t seem to find the words. He choked out a short laugh, finding humour in the absurdity of it all, “ENUTUR!” He bellowed, “Get over here!”

“What?” Enutur wheedled, “You can’t seriously-”

“Get over here!”

As Enutur made his way reluctantly across the deck the man in the armour leaned in a little, speaking quietly, “You do know that we’re going to take it as soon as you board, right?”

“Oh yeah I know, but fuck this guy,” I responded.

The soldiers didn’t seem to know what to make of it as Enutur counted out my money, even Enutur seemed astonished as he was doing it. I pocketed the money, and the leader waved dismissively at Enutur.

“What about my pay?” Enutur fretted.

One of the soldiers threw a coin pouch at Enutur, hitting him in the face, and Enutur clutched at the money as he made his way a little quickly back to the safety of his crewmen. The soldiers then drew out a pair of manacles, a short chain connected the hand and foot restraints. *Shit.*

“Really, am I going to run away?” I asked sarcastically.

“Do shut up,” said the leader, losing the feigned friendliness now that he was done playing with Enutur.

I wanted to leap at the man and shove my fingers though his eyes and into his brain, but I had to be patient and calm if I was going to get out of this. As much as it pissed me off to let them put the manacles on me, they’d be less on edge if they though I wasn’t the sort to put up a fight. The wrist manacles went on first, but thankfully I’d guess right, and the chain that connected them to the ankle manacles was far too short of someone my size.

“Can you get them around his legs?” asked the leader.

The chain was so short that the only real option was trying to get them around my thighs, and there was no way that was going to happen. *Never skip leg day.* They fiddled around with the manacles a little, but it was clear that it wasn’t going to happen.

“Enough,” snapped the leader, “Let’s get him on the ship.”

“Awful lot of trouble, just for one human,” I prodded, I had a sick curiosity in just how much I might be worth.

“Awful lot of money, just for one human,” said the leader, grabbing me by the bicep as we stepped up onto the gangplank.

It was a little unsteady, since each end of the gangplank was rising and falling with each ship. I slowed a little, which put him a little ahead of me as he pulled me across the gangplank by my arm. I looked down at the manacles, loose ends dangling near my knees.

“Hey, I wonder which is heavier, these manacles, or your armour?” I asked, and I threw myself towards him, just as he took a step.

I think he had probably been ready for me to try to pull away from him, but catching him off balance, and pushing towards instead of pulling away caught him by surprise. He tried to stay on his feet, his shorter stature and lower centre of gravity helping a lot, and he almost made it. Almost didn’t cut it though, and we both tumbled into the water between the ships. I managed to control the fall enough that he landed under me in the water, and I went out of my way to try to boot him in the abdomen when I landed on him. I was rewarded with a **whoof** as the air was knocked out of him right before his head went under, and I pushed away quickly to stop him from grabbing at my legs. I ended up under the surface as well, but where I’d been ready for it, he hadn’t and was now entirely out of breath. I could see him foundering in the murky water, trying to swim to the surface and unbuckle his armour at the same time. I surfaced, and could immediately hear the chaos I’d started above. The four soldiers were shouting conflicting commands, and I could hear more voices on both ships shouting back. I looked over at where the leader had ended up, and I could see the odd flailing limb breach the surface. I took in a huge breath, and dove.

It was not easy, swimming with both hands tied. But I managed a modified doggy paddle, the weight didn’t help a whole lot, but it did make it easier to stay under the surface as I swam under the Admypian ship. Both crews would be distracted by the man in the water, so I only needed to stay below the surface long enough to get clear of the immediate area. If I stayed below water not only would they lose track of me, they might even think that I’d drowned, dragged to the bottom by the manacles.

I managed to swim all the way under the Admypian ship, it had a surprisingly shallow draft, and I kicked as hard as I could towards, what I hoped was, the shore. It felt like I had spent an hour swimming under the water, but it couldn’t have been more than thirty seconds. I surfaced, being careful not to inhale any water along with the much needed air. I rolled onto my back, just buoyant enough to stay above water, and kicked away from the ships. I could see that they were still tied together and from the look of the figures moving around on the decks they were in total chaos. I wasn’t sure if they’d pulled their man out of the water or not, but thankfully I didn’t see anyone looking in my direction as I kicked towards shore.  I slowed my pace a little once I decided that I was clear of the ships. It would be no good to exhaust myself, and I had quite a ways to go. The shore hadn’t quite been on the horizon as we were traveling, but that only meant that it was three or four miles away, instead of five or six.

*Just think of it as a hundred laps of the pool.*

I’d done plenty of swimming along with all the biking and running, I had even done a hundred laps in a single session before, but I’d never done it with my hands tied. I’d known it was a stupid plan when I first thought of it, and I only became more certain of that as I swam. The tide was going in, which did help a little, unfortunately it also meant that the closer I got to shore the more waves there were crashing over my face. I managed to avoid inhaling any water, but the whole time I swam I was sure that I was about a second away from a watery grave. I managed to get through the breakers, avoid any under tow currents, and get to shore. I was gasping and sputtering as I tried to get my feet under me, waves crashing into me and knocking me flat each time I pulled myself up. My legs felt like they were made of lead, and I barely had enough coordination to crawl out of the surf. I did it though, dragging myself out of the sea and clear of the waves.

I crumpled forwards onto the ground, and managed to roll onto my side. I lay there gasping, noticing for the first time that the manacles had cut up my wrists. They did not fit well, and with the other half hanging loose they’d been jerked around by the current and the waves as I neared the shore. *Something about the multitool, need to get these off.* I was so exhausted that I could barely think straight, and I felt a stab of panic before I remembered that my glasses were in my pocket, and not lost to the sea.

“I’m really quite impressed,” said a woman’s voice, “did you really swim all that way with your hands tied?”

*Oh for fucks sake.*


# Chapter 16

I crumpled forwards onto the ground, and managed to roll onto my side. I lay there gasping, noticing for the first time that the manacles had cut up my wrists. They did not fit well, and with the other half hanging loose they’d been jerked around by the current and the waves as I neared the shore. *Something about the multitool, need to get these off.* I was so exhausted that I could barely think straight, and I felt a stab of panic before I remembered that my glasses were in my pocket, and not lost to the sea.

“I’m really quite impressed,” said a woman’s voice, “did you really swim all that way with your hands tied?”

*Oh for fucks sake.*

-----

I managed to haul myself up onto my knees, and saw three blurry figures spread out along the beach. I sighed heavily, and I pulled open my chest pocket, withdrawing my glasses. I slipped them on, and seeing things clearly did not make me feel any better. In the centre was an elf woman wearing a self-satisfied smile, and she seemed short even for a member of her specifies. Even kneeling as I was, we were nearly at eye level. She wore a dress of light blue silk, and over the dress was something that looked like a hybrid between a shawl and a cloak it was made of a coarser material, but dyed a rich green. Her gold hair was up in a bun, held in place with a pair of jade hairpins. The two other figures on the beach were women as well, though they wore the same style of segmented plate armour as the man I’d booted into the sea. Both had silver hair up in a bun, though their hairpins seemed to be wood rather than jade, and they each had a helmet tucked under one arm. They were both fairly large for elven women, maybe five and a half feet tall, and judging from the similarities the two were probably sisters. They were spread out widely on the beach, not quite surrounding me, but ready to move if I tried anything.

“This is not fair,” I said, with equal parts exhaustion and exasperation, “How could you even notice me in the water?”

She pursed her lips, and pointed behind me. I turned, to see the two ships I’d left in a rather poor state. It seems that I’d underestimated the amount of chaos I’d caused by throwing the leader off the gangplank. The two ships were twisting around each other, but some of the ropes tying them together must have snapped or come loose, because they weren’t side by side anymore. Instead the prow of the Admypian trireme was buried in the side of Enutur’s mail carrier, and that side of the mail carrier had been smashed in. The two ships were still afloat, but neither would be fit to sail any time soon.

“It caught my attention, and I had my coach driver stop so I could get a better look. And what do I find? A prize from the sea, bestowed by Sakana herself,” I could hear the smile in her voice, and I turned back to look towards the shore.

I looked up and down the beach, considering. To the east was the city, less than a mile away, which meant that fleeing in that direction would not end well. The empty beach stretched on into the west, and I could see a wide road and empty fields up the embankment. It was clear of opposition, but it was also clear of cover. That was assuming of course that I’d be able to run, and right now even standing seemed like it would take a titanic effort. I considered using an illusion, but discounted it almost immediately. Exhausted as I was I didn’t think I could hold one of the spells together well enough to have it move around convincingly, and I’d need two, one to distract the soldiers and one to hide in until they were drawn away. And as far as I’d been able to test, I needed to see the area I was moving the illusion to. *And if the trick was discovered? I’d be double fucked.*

“Considering your options?” She asked, with an almost sympathetic tone.

I looked down at my bloody wrists, seriously considering a run for it, regardless of how hopeless it would be. But as much as I hated the thought of being a slave, I wasn’t really the sort for bloody last stands. It probably wouldn’t go down like that anyway, the soldiers would be far more likely to club me over the head than stab me through the back, and then I’d still be captured. *It fucking kills me to do it, but I need to play along.*

“Oh it’s not so bad,” she said as she walked towards me, “You’ll have a far better life with me, than you’d have wherever you were going.”

“Come on,” she said gently, taking hold of my forearms and helping me up. *So were going for induced Stockholm Syndrome then.*

I got my feet under me, and she took a surprised step back when she realized just how big I was. She couldn’t have been more than four and a half feet tall, and her soldiers edged a little closer when they saw her reaction. She gathered herself quickly, and waved them back. She stepped in close to me, and withdrew a crude key from her pocket. *Don’t try to strangle her Quinn, remember, we’re playing along. No strangling people. Yet.* She was very gentle as she unlocked the manacles, making sure not to aggravate my wounds, and she dropped the rough iron chains into the sand.

“Come along, we’ll get you cleaned up,” she said, in the same sort of voice you might use with a skittish horse.

I matched her gaze, looking into her big blue eyes. *I’ve really got to do this, haven’t I?*

“It won’t be so bad,” she continued softly, taking my arm to steady me as I nearly fell over from exaustion, “I know you’re probably frightened, and far from home, but it’s not as bad as you’ve heard. What’s your name?”

“Quinn,” I said, after a moment of silence.

“Well Quinn, I’m Lady Chypia.”

Her soldiers trailed back a little as we climbed up the embankment and onto the road. Sitting there was a small coach, and sitting in the driver’s position was a young girl. She wore a tunic, and on her wrists were a pair of narrow silver cuffs. They weren’t linked together, but it was clear what they were meant to symbolize. She saw the state of my wrists and her eyes widened a little, hand going to her mouth.

“Fetch your things Millie.”

The girl, Millie, pulled something out from under the seat and hopped down.

“Please, sit,” said Chypia, still in her ‘frightened animal’ voice, “We’ll have to get you out of those wet clothes once we’re back home.”

I sat down on the running board of the coach, and Millie rushed over with a case. She set it down next to me, and looking inside I could see that it was an ancient approximation of a first aid kit. Millie looked like she was about to set to work but Chypia motioned her away.

“I’ll take care of this Millie, you tend to the horses.” *Definitely trying for the whole Stockholm Syndrome thing.*

I held out my arms and she tended to my wounds, using some sort of strong grain alcohol to disinfect the wounds. It stung like hell, but at least it wouldn’t get infected, though I was worried that tetanus might still be a risk. Assuming I got a pair of cuffs like the driver I wouldn’t have too hard a time getting back out of the city once I was in better shape. I’d need to be very careful, but I bet that I’d be able to throw a Basic Illusion over myself and just walk out the city gates. I had lost all of my stuff, but I might be able to make do for the week and a half it would take me to get to Nimre. In fact, once I thought about it I had to be awfully close to the border with Ashur. I had only been two days out by ship, before I disembarked rather hastily, so there couldn’t be that much more Admypia left to pass through.

*Rest up, get out under cover of illusion, and then book it for the border.*

I felt a little surer of myself now that I had a clear idea of how to deal with my imminent enslavement. The best antidote to fear is information, and having a plan went a long way to dispelling any feelings of hopelessness or helplessness.

Once Chypia was done cleaning out the wounds she wrapped up my wrists in clean bandages. I just leaned against the side of the carriage, exhausted and soaked. *Everything is sitting back on that damn ship. If Enutur tries to sell my things in Admypia while he’s getting the ship repaired someone might discover the spellbook, I need to get the hell out of here as fast as possible.*

Chypia touched a hand to my face, “That’s better, isn’t it?” She asked. *Laying it on rather thick aren’t we?*

I didn’t trust myself to speak, and nodded slightly instead. She helped me stand, opened the door of the coach for me.

“Take a seat, don’t worry about it getting wet, just sit,” she said gently but firmly.

I forced myself to play along, and I ducked into the carriage. I leaned my head against the window and closed my eyes, still reeling from exhaustion. A short time later I heard the door creak, and opened my eyes to see Chypia and one of the guards join me in the carriage. Both of them sat on the seat across from me, and I looked over the female soldier. She wasn’t quite what I expected from a military woman. She still wore makeup, though not a lot, and still kept her hair long. Even done up like it was, it was going to be slightly impractical with the helmet on. That wasn’t to say that she seemed unsuitable for the job though, she was clearly quite fit and carried herself well. She also wore no cuffs on her wrists.

“Is this the first time you’ve seen a woman in military service?” Asked Chypia, noticing me eyeing her guard.

*Maybe Admypians are less sexist, despite the whole slavery thing?*

“She’s the first I’ve seen here,” I replied, “it’s not so strange where I come from, though men still make up the bulk of the military.”

“Oh?” Chypia asked, smiling, “Just where are you from?”

“Canada,” I sighed.

“Oh, and what’s that like?” She asked, seeming eager to learn more about her new acquisition.

“Well,” I started, exhaustion making it hard to collect my thoughts, “It’s really cold, and really big. But mostly it’s just really boring.”

“Boring? Oh it must be at least a little bit interesting,” she chided.

“Hey, boring is good. If things are interesting it probably means something is going wrong, I strive every day to be as boring as possible. Hell, I went to university for computer science, that’s about as boring as it gets.”

She seemed taken aback, “You know, most men usually try to sell themselves a little better.”

“Well actually I’m pretty sure that the guys who were trying to sell me are on their way to the bottom of the bay,” I said wryly, jabbing a thumb out the window.

“Fine,” she said, biting off a quick laugh, “You said you went to university? You’re educated then?” And I could see the wheels turning in her head.

It was clear that I was going to get put to work doing something, so I might as well aim for something that would make escape easier.

“Yeah, lots of classes on mathematics, plenty of research papers to write,” *Please be a scribe, please be a scribe, please be a scribe.*

“Mmm, I’d have plenty of chances to show you off if I had you working as my steward,” *Close enough.* “How would you like that?” She offered congenially.

*She does seem to be trying to make things bearable for me, but I doubt it’s simply done out of the goodness of her heart.*

“I suppose,” I hedged.

Chypia was about to respond, but was distracted as the carriage stopped. I could hear voices outside, and guessed that we’d reached the city gates.

She pulled aside the shutter, “Guardsmen?” She called.

“Oh, no need to trouble yourself m’lady, you’re clear to carry on,” I heard one of the voices say.

“Oh not you,” she said, and pointed out of the carriage, “him, yes you. Come over here.”

She pushed open the door of the carriage, and I could see a guard in mail armour with a long rune carved staff held in both hands approach.

“Yes m’lady?” Asked the man, a little unsure, he seemed younger than the first voice.

Chypia waved a hand in my direction, and I looked back to the man to see him pointing the staff at me. The soldier spoke what sounded an awful lot like an incantation.

*Oh fuck.*

There was a beat, as I looked between Chypia and the guard, trying to mask my sudden sheer terror with confusion.

“He’s no Mage m’lady, will that be all?”

*What?*

“Yes thank you,” and she shut the door, the carriage continuing into the city.

“How did you get the stick? I thought that Admypia didn’t use magic,” I probed.

“We use magic, or at least we use mages,” she said somewhat quietly, not looking at me.

*Sore subject? Hmmm.*

“Just be glad you’re not a Mage yourself,” she finished.

“Is it that much worse to be a Mage-slave than a normal slave? Slavery already seems pretty awful all on its own,” I said, well aware of my current predicament.

She gave me a dark look, “It is worse, there are rules for slaves like you,” and she put emphasis on the word ‘rules’, “There are no rules for how Mages are to be treated. Even a noble is not immune, if they are found to be a Mage then they are truly damned. They are taken from their family and auctioned off like any other chattel.”

I didn’t really have a good response for that, and we spent the rest of the journey in silence.

-----

About half an hour after washing up on the beach I found myself standing in front of a large and opulent manor. *Fat lot of good my ‘escape’ did me.* It wasn’t quite walled, but there was a sort of built up foundation that raised the rest of the manor up off of street level by about five feet. The area around the raised foundation was cleared, and despite being in the city there was quite a bit of green. Likely the small park and the raised platform were meant to set the manor apart from the rest of the city in the way that a wall might have. The manor itself had two wide wings, in a sort of reverse ‘U’ shape, leaving a large open space in between that looked rather like a private garden. All in all it looked rather nice, but my appreciation of the scenery was rather dampened- *get it?* -by the chafing of my still soaked clothes. Oh, and also the whole slavery thing. I was still fairly clumsy with fatigue, and my wet shoes and socks only made things worse. It was like trying to walk around with mallets for feet, and Chypia seized upon the opportunity to continue her ‘conversion’ of me.

“Here,” she said softly, taking my arm and helping me up the steps, “We’ll get you out of those wet clothes and all dried off.”

The two female guards followed close at hand, but slightly behind. I could feel their eyes on me, and resolved to wait to attempt escape until they weren’t anywhere nearby. Chypia lead me into the manor, calling for some of her servants. I was whisked upstairs to a room with a large steaming tub and found myself rather flustered when two tiny elven servants, they had copper cuffs similar to the driver’s, started to try to undress me.

I coughed, “Whoa! Excuse me?” I said, trying to keep one of them from pulling down my jeans and the other from trying to pull of my shirt.

“Is there a problem?” Asked Chypia, leaning into the room.

The two girls giggled, “He’s a little shy,” one of them said.

“Oh, would you prefer boys to bathe you?” Chypia teased.

“Oh he’s turning pink,” said the other girl.

*I might be slightly more interested in this if I had a choice in the matter, it’s not like these two aren’t attractive*

“I-I think I can manage to bathe myself th-thank you,” I stammered out.

The two serving girls looked at Chypia for assent, still smiling, and Chypia pursed her lips as she eyed me.

“I can bathe myself, m’lady,” she asserted.

“I can bathe myself, m’lady,” I repeated.

She seemed to consider for a moment, before waving them out of the room. She gave me an incomprehensible look, and then closed the door.

*This makes me sick. I’d almost rather get beaten, at least I’d be able to understand that better. Don’t underestimate this lady, she might speak softly, that just means she’s going in for the deep psychological shit.*

I slipped into the bath, careful to keep my bandages out of the water, and I lay there for a while considering my options.

*There’s no way in hell it’s going to be as easy as walking out the front gates. If they enslave mages as a matter of course they’ve got to have some way to detect mages trying to escape the city with magic.*

I was rather lost in thought, when the door suddenly opened and one of the girls stepped in, I jumped a little, startled by the sudden intrusion.

“Oh you are so precious,” she said, “but I’m not here for you,” and she set some dry clothes by the door, scooped up my discarded clothes and left.

*Well there goes the rest of my things.*

-----


# Chapter 17

I got out of the bath a little while later, clean and dry, and I picked up the clothes left out for me. There was a silk tunic, the same light blue colour as Chypia’s dress had been, and it was belted with a green silk rope. I stepped out of the bathroom, and into the large and luxurious bedroom beyond. Chypia was sitting on the bed, and had what remained of my things laid out next to her on a towel. She patted the bed next to her, and I sat down rebelliously. It was like sitting down obediently, except I was thinking rebellious thoughts as I did it.

“I was just going through your things, some of its very interesting,” and she slipped a little closer to me as she picked up my four-colour pen, “Like this one, what is it?”

“It’s a pen,” I explained, “May I?”

She nodded, and I took the pen, showing her how it worked, “Mmm, coloured ink? And you need no inkwell, is this given as a gift to graduates of the university you attended?”

I looked at her questioningly, “Most of the universities here in Adympia or Nimre will give ornate fountain pens to graduates in mathematics or literature. They’re usually gold, but I’ve never seen this material before, what’s it called?”

“It’s plastic,” I said flatly, “And the pen was two dollars at the university book store.”

“Is two dollars a large sum of money?”

“Two dollars is about half what it costs for a gallon of milk or fresh baked loaf of bread,” I explained, trying not to be condescending.

“Oh,” she said, seeming a little disappointed, ”This? Is this also so inexpensive as to be commonplace?” She asked, holding up my watch.

“No, you can get cheap watches, but this is not one of them.”

“I’m impressed that it still works after your swim,” she said, watching the second hand tick along, “How accurate is it?”

“Not sure, but it’s accurate to within something like two or three seconds per day.”

“Mmm, I think I’ll let you have this back, along with your pen. It’s good to have a steward that’s punctual.”

I took the watch and the pen as she handed them to me, putting them both into a pocket on the tunic. My wrists were still sore and I didn’t want the bandage getting caught up in the hinges on the band of the watch.

“What about these?” She asked, holding up my rings. *If she knows a mage stone or a mana stone by sight…*

“This one,” I started, indicating the ring with the mana stones set into it, “Belonged to my grandmother. It’s not much to look at, I think the stones are just coloured quartz, but it’s one of the things that gets passed down so I’ve kept it.”

She seemed to buy that, and nodded for me to continue, “This one I made after I arrived, the stone is actually only a bit of glass, and the ring itself is made of Aluminum”

“Pure aluminum?” She asked, a little shocked.

“Yeah, it’s much more commonplace where I come from. The glass too, it’s clearer than anything I’ve seen here but it’s nothing special where I come from. Aluminum is actually how I financed my journey, I sold some of it back in Myra to pay for passage.”

She seemed to notice me sour as I thought of the captain I’d paid, “I told you Quinn, it’s not so bad when you get used to it. You’ll live in far more luxury serving me than you would working for some Rhonan lord.”

*You’re right, I’m pretty sure ‘getting used to it’ is how most people would explain Stockholm Syndrome.*

“These ones,” I said, trying to keep my expression from betraying my thoughts, “Are just wooden thumb rings meant for archery. They make it easier to draw a heavy bow, and prevent damage to the thumb.”

“Oh, what does a mathematician need with a bow?” She asked, *dammit.*

“Well, nothing. I’d only ever done it as a hobby, but this place is quite a lot more dangerous than Canada. I figured I might as well have some way to defend myself from bandits and the like.”

“And your bow is back on the ship you were so eager to leave?” She asked, most amused.

“Yeah. I suppose Enutur is going to try to sell it?” I asked.

“Perhaps, though I imagine that the Alkides family is going to lay some claim to it and the rest of your things to try to recoup the costs of trying to capture you.”

“Do the Adympians enslave every traveler that tries to pass through their lands? Seems like that would stifle trade rather a lot.”

“Not everyone, not even most people, with the right documents most people can travel through Adympia with no trouble. But then you’re not most people are you Quinn,” she said softly.

“So just all Outsiders then, I guess they don’t get fancy documents allowing them to pass unmolested?” I asked, not at all bitterly.

“Oh you can get the documents at any Adympian consulate before you cross the border. They’re just not worth anything, once the first families decided that they were willing to pay the fines and the bribes to enslave an Outsider whether they had papers or not, everyone started doing it.”

I had plenty to say on what I thought about that, but decided to remain quiet. All I’d end up doing is aggravating her. I was saved from needing to come up with some response though, as there was a knock at the door.

“Yes?” Asked Chypia.

The door opened slightly, and one of the servant girls from before poked her head in, “I got you the salve you asked for m’lady.”

“Ah, yes. Bring it over Aris,” she called.

Aris came into the room and in one hand she carried a jar, probably the salve, along with a damp cloth. In the other hand she carried a pair of gold cuffs.

“Do you want help with the bandages m’lady?” Asked Aris.

“No, you are dismissed,” she responded, and Aris bowed and left. I saw as she left that both of the guards from before were standing just outside the door.

“What is that?” I asked, nodding towards the jar. *Is it magic?*

“Hush,” she shushed me, “let me see your arm.”

She undid the bandages on both arms, revealing my injured wrists. Now that they’d stopped bleeding quite as much I could see the cuts more clearly, and they were a lot worse than I’d thought.

“Mmm, can’t have these leaving nasty scars on my new trophy,” she murmured as she rubbed the salve onto the wounds.

I inhaled sharply as the salve was applied, it stung like hell, but I could also see the wounds closing cleanly right before my eyes. *Damn. I need me some healing magic.* Once the wounds were done closing she took the damp cloth and cleaned off the excess salve. I examined my arms to find that there was absolutley no trace of any injury, no scar, no scab, not even any redness.

Then she snapped a cuff onto each wrist. *Be calm, play along. You can get these off later.*

Chypia touched my face leaning in a little close, “Isn’t that better?” she whispered.

“Yes.” I said, rather uncomfortably.

“Yes m’lady?” She prompted.

“Yes m’lady,” I recited, and I tried to keep from sighing.

“Mmm, I don’t think I like your eyes hidden behind these,” she said, tapping on my glasses.

I tensed up a little at that, and was not smooth enough to keep her from noticing, “You wanted me to be a steward right? I can’t do much without these, I can’t see well enough to read or write, and I might not be able to recognize you in a crowd.”

She seemed to think about it for a moment, looking into my eyes and not taking her hand from my face. Finally she spoke, “I suppose I’ll allow you to keep them for now.”

“What’s this then?” She asked, handing me the folding knife, still locked shut.

*A tempting opportunity.*

I flicked it open, “It’s a knife,” I said, just as quietly as she’d been speaking.

This time she froze. I guess she hadn’t checked through my things very well, and she seemed suddenly aware of just how substantial the size difference was.

“Would you like this back, m’lady?” I asked, looking her right in the eye.

She held out an open hand, though didn’t speak, and I placed the knife into her hand.

“The other one is a knife too, though it also has a few other things, pliers, scissors, that sort of thing.”

“I think I understand,” she said, as she stood up, bundling up the towel and taking my things with her, “The girls will bring you dinner in an hour or so. Rest, and in the morning I will explain your duties to you.

She left, and as soon as the door closed I padded over as quickly and quietly as possible. I put my ear to the door and listened. I didn’t hear any eye opening conversation between Chypia and her guards, but I did hear three sets of footsteps walking away. I considered bolting immediately, but I was pretty sure that I would only get one shot at this. I didn’t know enough about how Adympia kept track of their slaves to risk a run for the gate, and the cuffs were kind of a giveaway if I tried to talk my way out. Basic Illusion was also out of the question until I could determine what kind of countermeasures they had in place over the gates to stop exactly the sort of thing I wanted to try.

I sat back down on the bed, and examined the cuffs. They were both gold, which I supposed was some rank of status. *Something something small favours.* And I was fairly sure that they were solid gold, though the cuffs weren’t very thick. There was silk padding on the inside of the cuffs, though these would still start to chafe eventually.

*I could get through these things with a metal file in rather short order.*

*Unless these are magic too… Do I cast Detect Magic on them?* It was risky, on the one hand they might carry an enchantment to start setting off alarms if someone tried to magic them, but on the other hand they might need to check up on any magical enchantments that might exist. I decided to risk it, perhaps foolishly, but I figured that they’d only put the magical countermeasures on restraints meant specifically for mages. As far as I knew mages were rare, and probably rarer in Adympia since most mages with any mobility would get the hell out as quickly as possible, so they probably *hopefully* wouldn’t be throwing complicated enchantments on every damn thing.

*Assuming that sort of enchantment is substantially more complicated than an enchantment that just makes these tougher.*

I went for it, casting Detect Magic, and I’d be lying if I said that I wasn’t hiding next to the door, waiting for the guards to burst in and beat me half to death.

They didn’t, which was nice.

But my antics distracted me as the spell went off, and had to recast the damn thing to actually get the reading on the cuffs. The cuffs were magical, and the spell informed me that the type of magic was ‘Abjuration’, but the spell didn’t give me any idea of the magnitude of the enchantment.

*No  ‘Detection’ or any detecty sounding words, so I guess I’m safe?*

This did mean that stealing a metal file from a blacksmith might not be the solution though. Adympia as a whole had probably seen most things tried, though being a mage on the loose was probably an advantage.

*I still don’t know why their little detector didn’t work. Maybe it checks someone’s mana level, mine is abysmal afterall.*

-----

I waited for Pasa to bring along my dinner, and went over my The Great Escape plan. First, I needed the cuffs off. They were apparently enchanted, but there had to be some limit. Hopefully I’d still be able to get through these things with enough effort. I’d still try to get my hands on a metal file, even just to test the durability of these things. Second, I needed to figure out what, if any, countermeasures existed on the gates out of the city. *Or I try to get out through the harbour? I’ll need to check that too.* Third, I needed to get the hell damned out of here. There were probably more steps, I just had no idea what they’d be yet.

I poked around the bedroom, hoping to find convenient secret passages or hidden caches of supplies left by secret abolitionists to aid my escape. Didn’t find anything like that unfortunately. I was only on the second floor though, and I was fairly sure that I’d be able to tie together enough of the bedsheets and the curtains to get me to the ground. I might even be able to jump if I was in a hurry, though I’d rather not have my escape attempt cut short by a pair of broken legs. There wasn’t much else in the way of escape materials, though there were some books. It did look like they were meant mostly for show, and as far as I could tell none of the spines had been cracked, but I picked through them anyway until I found something to help pass the time.

-----

There was a knock on the door an hour or so later, “Enter,” I called.

The two servants from before entered, *Pasa and Aris?* bearing trays with fancy covered dishes. I was sitting at the desk in the room, reading the book I’d found and I pushed it aside to give them room to set down the trays. They lifted off the covers, and oh dear god, the food was amazing. There was a steak, an actual steak, and there might have been some vegetables, but I was distracted by the steak. To go along with the steak was a tall glass of what looked and smelled like beer which was a nice touch, though I’d never really been very fond of beer. I cut into the steak and took a bite, it was a little rarer than I usually got my steak, but it was still fantastic.

*If Chypia is trying to convert me then this isn’t a bad way to do it, I’ve not eaten this well since I arrived here. Hell, I don’t remember the last time I had a steak this good back on Earth.*

“Are you pleased?” one of them asked eagerly, *Pasa I think? Whatever, she’s the green one.*

“Do you like it?” asked the other, equally as eager, *Aris? The blue one?* at nearly the same time.

“Yes, thank you,” I reassured them.

They didn’t seem to take this as the hint to leave though, and they still seemed to be waiting for something.

“Is there something else?” I asked of them.

“Lady Chypia wanted us to ask you which of us you liked best,” asked Pasa.

I raised an eyebrow at this, “What do you mean?” I asked, unsure where this was going.

They both started to speak, stumbling over each other, before Pasa let Aris take the lead, “Lady Chypia said that you’re to be her new steward, and that you should have your own servant. You can have whichever of us you like.”

*Make me more comfortable with the concept of slavery by giving me my own slave? Clever I suppose.*

“And just what is it you’d be doing for me?” I asked, I hadn’t needed a slave so far, and I didn’t feel like I needed one now.

“Anything,” and the way she said anything make me feel like I needed a smoke, or maybe a cold shower.

*Whoa, okay Quinn. Calm down a little.*

“Oh he’s turning pink again!” Said Pasa, which set them both to giggling.

I sighed, “Aren’t you both slaves? I thought there were rules, can she make you do that sort of, uh, anything?” I asked about as awkwardly as humanly possible.

“No, she can’t punish us for disobeying that sort of instruction, but she can reward us for being such obedient servants,” Aris explained, still grinning.

I looked between the two of them, and they both seemed eager and willing, but as far as I was concerned they’d been coerced into this situation. Taking advantage of Chypia’s psychological control over the two of them would be as wrong as taking one of them by force. I’d probably have to pick one of them though, otherwise Chypia would probably just assign one of them to me. The two seemed somewhat similar in build, and were the same height as Chypia herself. *She probably doesn’t like servants that are much taller than her.* They also had the same generous proportions that Chypia had, though none of them came close to Thera. Aris was very blue, with pastel blue hair and sapphire eyes. Even her skin seemed a touch blue, though it didn’t make her look unhealthy. Pasa on the other hand was very green, with pastel green hair and emerald eyes. Pasa’s skin was also very slightly green. Despite the odd colouring they both seemed to be city elves, even Pasa’s hair didn’t quite seem like the wood elf shade of green.

*Dye job? But who dyes someone’s skin? That’s one hell of a way to display ownership of a person though, and Chypia does seem fond of blue and green. Shame that neither of them is red.*

I sighed, I was doing a lot of that lately, “You then,” I said, nodding towards Aris.

Pasa looked a little crestfallen, but Aris jumped up, arms up in the air as if she’d just won some contest.

“Yes! Now shoo, shoo,” Aris said, as she swept Pasa out of the room.

I watched the antics as I ate my steak, not sure what I’d need to contend with once I was alone with Aris. Thankfully I didn’t get leapt on immediately, but she hovered by my elbow, eyeing me as I ate.

“Aris,” I started.

“Yes Quinn?” She asked, somehow making Quinn into a title.

“Is there something you’re waiting for?” I asked, looking at her out out of the corner of my eye as I ate.

“I’m waiting upon you, Quinn.”

I had to make a conscious effort not to sigh heavily again.

“Why don’t you take a seat,” I invited.

“Ah…”

“Is there a problem?” I asked.

“Servants don’t usually sit while their charge is eating,” she explained.

“There’s no one else here Aris, you can sit.”

She seemed a little unsure, but she eventually took a seat on the footrest for one of the chairs in the room.

“Is Chypia, Lady Chypia,” I corrected myself, I wasn’t yet sure how loyal she was, “Aware that I might not exactly be familiar with all of the social customs of Adympia?”

“Yes, that’s one of the things that she said I’d need to help you with.”

“Oh, and what else does she think I’ll need your help with?” I probed.

“I’m supposed to help you get used to your new duties, learn the rules of etiquette, teach you about all the different Adympian families and their relationships with Lady Chypia, and…” She said, with a small smile,” I’m supposed to make you feel more comfortable.”

*I wasn’t aware that you could delegate seduction.*

“Oh you’re turning pink again!” She cheered.

I just shook my head.

“Oh no,” she said, her eyes suddenly wide, putting a hand to her mouth, “Have you never been with a woman before?”

*Oh for fucks sake.*

“That is not- argh- that’s not really- forget it,” I stammered out, “Why don’t you tell me about what forks I should be using.”

-----

Aris spent some time explaining the ‘rules’ to me, and I did my best to pay attention. I really hoped that I wouldn’t be here long enough to need the information, but I also wanted to get on Chypia’s good side. If I could get her to trust me enough to let me leave her little palace without a guard to escort me then I’d be most of the way to escaping already. Eventually the hour grew late, and it came time to go to sleep.

This made things rather awkward.

“Please, what have I done to disappoint you Quinn?” Aris asked, hands clasped infront of her, eyes downcast.

She’d laid out some Quinn sized silk pyjamas, though she called them nightclothes, but things had gone kind of downhill from there. She’d started by trying to undress me, which was apparently entirely normal, I guess that Adympia nobles were too lazy to dress and undress themselves. I managed to keep her hands off of me, but then she climbed into my bed, waiting for me to change. It was when I told her to get out of my room so I could sleep that the real problem started. When I’d first told her to leave she looked at me like I’d just slapped her across the face, she’d gotten out of my bed, but stopped in front of me to ask her question.

“You haven’t done anything wrong Aris,” I said, a little impatiently, “But I just want to sleep, and not do anything else with you.”

Her head fell further, “Do you want me to go get Pasa for you?” she asked quietly, seeming somehow ashamed.

*I probably could have phrased that better.*

“That’s not what I meant, Aris. I want to sleep alone, it doesn’t matter if it’s you or Pasa or anyone else. That’s why I want you to leave.”

That wasn’t strictly true. I didn’t want to sleep alone, and I rather did like the idea of sleeping with Aris, but the whole situation still just made me feel sick. If not for Enutur I would have been landing in Nimre this time tomorrow night, or early the morning after. Instead, I was stuck in a bedroom that may as well have been a prison, inside a manor that was just a slightly larger prison, and all that was in a city, that was all just one damn big prison.

“But, I didn’t mean to offend you Quinn,” still making Quinn sound like a title, “And I’m very sorry, but will you please let me sleep tonight?”

“Aris,” I started, hesitating, “I’m not trying to punish you, I just want to sleep alone. Don’t you have your own room?”

“No, normally Pasa and I sleep in Lady Chypia’s room, but she’s already picked a new Lady’s Servant from the house staff.”

“Uh, and, uh, do they normally sleep in Lady Chypia’s bed?” I asked, getting very interesting ideas.

*Maybe I* ***should*** *try this whole slavery thing.*

Aris looked up at me through her hair, and I could see that she was raising an eyebrow sceptically.

“I’m just asking, I didn’t mean anything by it,” I said, raising my hands.

She smiled a little, and I was pretty sure that I’d started blushing again, “Our Lady sometimes expects us to warm up her bed for her, but we normally sleep in the servant’s bed.”

“In her room?” I asked, looking around for something similar in my bedroom, but coming up empty.

Aris walked over and pulled out a large drawer from the side of my own bed. It had a matress inside of it, “Don’t they have these where you come from?” she asked.

“No, and we don’t really have servants where I come from either,” I said.

“You don’t? Then who does all the cooking, and cleaning? Who washes the dishes and does the laundry?” She asked, seeming sceptical.

“Well we’ve got machines for the dishes and laundry. If someone doesn’t really want to cook then they can order food brought to their house, I guess cleaning is the only thing? But even then, we’ve got machines to make that much easier too,” I said, wishing I could order a pizza at that moment.

“Are they magic machines?” She asked, even more sceptical than before.

“No, just normal machines,” I said, looking at the little pull-out bed she was standing beside.

“Um, is it going to be okay if I sleep here?” She asked, seeing my look, “I promise to be really really quiet.”

I sighed, “Yeah, I guess.”

*Looks like I’ve got a servant and a chaperone now. That does rather complicate my escape plans. Damn, am I going to have to bring her with me when I leave?*

# Chapter 18

I was standing in the doorway to the library, leaning on the doorframe, watching Quinn work. I’d told him what I expected of him, but I wasn’t quite prepared to handle what I’d unleashed when I showed him some of my ledgers. He initially seemed confused when he started flipping through them, and I was worried that he wasn’t quite as learned as I’d thought, but then confusion turned to anger, and anger turned to disgust.

He began some sort of explanation about something called ‘positional numbering systems’ while he started to pull out the rest of my ledgers and flip through them. This might have been the first steward or scribe I’d ever had that approached accounting with such fervour. I couldn’t understand half of what he was saying, but wasn’t about to let him know that so I nodded along with him, letting him know that I had other business to handle and that I’d check in on him later.

At some point between then and now he’d roped in both of my scribes, and seemed to be browbeating the two of them into learning his new numbering symbols. Whether I understood what he was saying or not, it was impressive to watch. The more I heard him speak, especially to the other servants, the more I came to the conclusion that he was not some simple merchant’s son. It was like watching a nobleman holding court, or a general briefing his officers.

He’d found a chalkboard somewhere, and was gibbering something about “The concept of zero” while the two scribes looked on with an expression that made me think they doubted Quinn’s sanity. Oh, and poor Aris. She was sitting in a chair near Quinn with her knees pulled up to her chest, and she had a very wide-eyed expression as her gaze darted between Quinn and his chalkboard. She was a dear, but if I had a hard time understanding what Quinn was going on about then Aris was truly lost.

Quinn’s self-confidence and commanding attitude was an asset in a steward, I certainly didn’t want to spend my time micromanaging the servants, but the same commanding attitude that made him a good steward made him a bad toy. It was the same dilemma I had with his body, he was a huge and delicious piece of meat, but if he decided that he didn’t want me ‘playing’ with him then there wouldn’t be much I could do to stop him from hurting me.

This was why I’d set Aris the task of taming him. If Quinn had his own toys to play with then he might be a little bit more grateful in the future. It was always a slow process to convert a new slave to my side, but it was always more rewarding to make a slave **want** to obey, than it was to beat them into submission. Pasa and Aris were proof of that, it had taken years to meld them into the slaves they were today, but I’d never have been able to get results anything like this if I’d tried more brutal methods. It was much the same with Quinn, there was no point in trying to whip him into submission, when I wanted a giant sized plaything to hold me close in the middle of the night.

I caught Aris’s eye, and motioned her over. I’d need a report of how well she did last night, and I wanted the juicy details. Aris excused herself, though I don’t think Quinn even noticed her get up, and I shut the door so we could speak without being overheard.

I could tell just from her expression that she had not done well. She had her head down, hair hiding her eyes, clearly ashamed.

“Explain yourself Aris,” I said sternly, though not harshly, “This should not have been that difficult.”

“I’m sorry m’Lady, I don’t know what happened. I tried, I tried my best, I promise. I even tried making him feel guilty, I told him that I didn’t have anywhere else to sleep.”

“That is clever,” I said pleased, and Aris beamed at the complement, “didn’t it work?”

“No m’Lady, I ended up sleeping in the servant’s bed. I’m sorry,” she said, apologetically.

“Aris, hmmm, you really tried everything?” I asked, and she nodded, “I don’t want you to think you’re worth any less than Pasa, but do you think that she might have better luck?”

“Maybe, but I even asked him if he wanted me to send Pasa in when I was trying to make him feel guilty,” I smiled, she’d learned better even than I’d thought, “but he just told me that he didn’t want to sleep with anyone.”

I frowned, “Aris, do you think…” I trailed off, what good would Quinn be as a toy if-

“No m’Lady, I saw the way he looked at Pasa and I. He wants us, I just can’t get him to act on it.”

“Hmm, this isn’t usually so difficult. Normally you don’t have any trouble getting new conquers to jump right on top of you,” I considered, this was definitely not going to be easy.

“I know, I’m sorry m’Lady. What do you want me to do instead?”

“Well either I send Pasa along with you next time, or we start slow, and work our way up,” I said, thoughtfully.

“It might be best to start slow, I don’t think we’ll have any more luck if we’re both trying to get him into bed. He’d probably just push us away like he had when we were first going to help him bathe.”

“Alright, well I leave it in your capable hands then Aris,” I said, patting her cheek.

“Yes m’Lady,” she said, a bit more cheerful now.

I shooed her along, and she returned to tending to Quinn. I growled once she was gone, bringing one closed hand down on the shelf next to me.

“Dammit!” *This is going to take ages. Maybe I should just have a valet buy me some silk rope.*

-----

I spent the rest of the day curled up in the chair, watching Quinn try to teach the others his new numbering system. He didn’t seem to be getting through to them, especially since Erilon seemed insulted when Quinn said that his numbers were better than Erilon’s numbers.

“I’ve been serving our Lady for over sixty years, you’ve been here for only two days and you think you know this material better than we do?” Erlion said angrily.

“It takes weeks to just learn these ledgers well enough to know what they contain,” Cusole cut in.

“That’s probably because the numbering system you use is nearly incomprehensible. If you’d been using this numbering system since the start,” Quinn said, pointing at the chalkboard where he’d written several strange symbols, “Any scribe could sit down with these ledgers and understand Lady Chypia’s accounts immediately.”

Erlion and Cusole started talking at the same time, and then they started shouting and I just curled up in the chair, making myself as small as possible. Quinn never did raise his voice, but he was clearly as angry as the other two. The three of them argued until lunch time, when Lady Chypia finally broke them up by telling Quinn to come to lunch with her.

-----

Pasa and I brought lunch out for Quinn and Lady Chypia. Our Lady was enjoying a glass of wine, but Quinn had insisted on water for himself.

“So it’s…” Quinn was saying, “Emperor, King, Duke, Marquis, Count, Baron, and Knight? Unless Adympia also has Archdukes, Viscounts and Baronets.”

“That’s very good,” praised Lady Chypia, “Though I’m not familiar with those last three titles.”

“Archdukes are between Kings and Dukes, I think only the Holy Roman Empire ever had Archdukes though. Viscounts are between Counts and Barons I think, not sure about that one, but I’m pretty sure the title was never hereditary. And the Baronets are below Barons, and I think that the only way that they were different from knights was that they weren’t expected to be personally involved in warfare.”

“I’m impressed,” Lady Chypia said while smiling, and I was suddenly a little jealous of Quinn, “Was this all a part of your education Quinn?”

“Not exactly,” said Quinn, with a wry smile as Pasa and I set out the food for the two of them.

Lady Chypia gave Quinn a questioning look and Pasa and I stood aside, to wait on their needs.

“Ah, Crusader Kings Two,” said Quinn, “It’s a sort off… training… game. It’s hard to explain, but it teaches the management of feudal dynasties.”

“Is it like Zatrikion?” Lady Chypia asked.

“Yeah,” answered Quinn, “Though it’s rather more complicated than Zatrikion.”

“You know how to play Zatrikion?”

“Yeah, and fairly well too.”

“Hmm, I’ll have to see about that once we’re done with our lunch. You had asked about Ventia though, this is Marquis Volinio’s capital city. The land he controls is only the size of a county, but it’s considered a March since it’s on the border.”

“Didn’t you mention that you’re related somehow to the Marquis?”

“Yes, my father was his cousin.”

“Doesn’t that put you somewhere in the line of succession?” Asked Quinn, he seemed surprisingly interested.

“In Adympia women only have a place in the line of succession if there are no viable male heirs available. Marquis Ventia has no sons, but he had another cousin, and that cousin had a son. He, Nusalvo, is the current heir, at least until the Marquis has a son of his own,” Lady Chypia was explaining.

Quinn had been sketching something on a piece of parchment, and he turned it so our Lady could see it.

“Like this?” He asked, and Lady Chypia nodded, “So then only these ones,” he said, pointing at some of the circles near the root of the tree like drawing, “Are all dead then?”

“Yes, why do you ask?” she asked.

“Well, I was just wondering how healthy Nusalvo is. I mean, is he a fan of any risky hobbies? Does he have any enemies?” Quinn asked, and my eyes got wider and wider as he spoke.

Lady Chypia blinked, “Are you- You don’t waste any time do you?”

“I’m only asking,” Quinn said, raising his hands, “It’s entirely reasonable to worry about the health of the heir to the realm.”

“Is that what you’re doing? You’re not considering anything else?” Lady Chypia asked wryly.

“Of course not, what could you possibly mean?” Asked Quinn, then his expression changed to shock, “Why Lady Chypia,” he said, taken aback, “Are you seriously suggesting what I think you’re suggesting? I can’t believe that you’d be so cold. Count me in, I’ve got a few ideas myself.”

Lady Chypia looked at me and Pasa for some sort of support, she seemed barely able to believe what she was hearing.

“Unless you’re on good terms with your, second cousin? Not sure what the term would be,” Quinn said.

Lady Chypia’s expression grew dark, *oh Tila…* “No. I most certainly am not.”

Quinn seemed a little surprised at the change in attitude, but seemed to take it in stride, “Is this the sort of conversation we’d want to have somewhere else?” He asked, “Though I’m guessing that these two,” he gestured at us, “can be trusted on this matter?”

“You’re right about Pasa and Aris, but this is something we will speak on at a later time,” Lady Chypia said, the thought of her sister had clearly shaken her, “Enjoy your meal Quinn.”

Lady Chypia stood up, leaving most of her meal uneaten. Pasa glanced at me before leaving with her. Lady Chypia likely didn’t want to cry in front of Quinn.

Quinn looked to me, seeming a little worried, “Should I not have suggested…” he trailed off.

“No, no. It’s not that. Once m’Lady gathers herself I don’t think she’s going to waste any time asking all about your idea, but it’s a sore subject for her,” I explained.

“What do you mean? Was she close once with the man?” Quinn asked.

“No, well, they never really saw each other…” I trailed off, I wasn’t sure how much I was supposed to tell Quinn. Playing on his sympathy seemed to be the best way to ‘convert’ him as Lady Chypia wanted, so I went ahead and told him, “They never really saw much of each other, until it started to become clear that the Marquis wasn’t going to have a son. Once Lord Nusalvo realized that he was going to be the heir, he started to consolidate his position. That mostly meant making sure that Lady Chypia didn’t do something to get a better claim, or do something to make him not eligible.”

“I thought women couldn’t inherit unless there were no men in line?” Quinn asked.

“Well no, but Lady Chypia said it’s almost never that simple. She said that if you say you’re the Marquis, and everyone thinks you’re the Marquis, it wouldn’t matter Lord Nusalvo was technically the heir,” I explained, trying to remember what Lady Chypia had told me.

“So Lord Nusalvo started trying to make sure Lady Chypia couldn’t swoop in and take the March away from him. What is it he did to Lady Chypia?”

“Well, I say he was trying to stop Lady Chypia from taking the March away. But that’s not quite how it happened,” I took a breath, “Lady Chypia is the younger sister, Concia is the older sister.”

Quinn seemed to understand, “And as Lord Nusalvo was digging around for dirt on his competition, he managed to find out the secret that the then Lady Concia had been hiding, that she was a Mage.”

“Yes,” I said in a small voice.

“I don’t mean to blame Lady Chypia, but couldn’t she have just bought her sister back?” Quinn asked.

“No, when someone finds out that a noble is a Mage, their family isn’t allowed to make a bid on them. Owning any Mage is a mark of prestige for a noble, but owning a Mage that was once a noble themselves? It makes it pretty clear which family is the greater, especially when a noble can do whatever they like to a Mage. So after Concia was enslaved, Nusalvo made sure to win the auction, and he likes to remind our Lady of just what he has her sister doing for him whenever he can,” just talking about it made me sick, I could only imagine how Lady Chypia felt right now.

“So,” he started, “sounds like I’ve got an assassination **and** a rescue to plan.”

-----

I woke up in the library, to find it completely empty. I was laying on the couch with a pillow under my head, and a couple of blankets covering me. Quinn had packed up all the books he’d been reading and gone to bed it seemed. I looked at the clock, it was nearly ten at night, and we’d been here since Quinn finished lunch. I guess I’d fallen asleep at some point, and Quinn had done his best to make me comfortable. I sat up, pushing the blankets aside. I still had work to do on him, and I wanted to get him used to me sleeping in the same room as him. Hopefully I’d be able to work up to the same bed at some point.

I padded though the quiet halls of Lady Chypia’s manor, everyone else had already gone to bed, until I found Quinn’s room. I put an ear to the door, and could hear someone moving around. I opened the door quietly, hoping to catch Quinn of guard by walking in while he was half dressed. His hair was still wet from the bath, and he didn’t have a shirt on and seemed to be trying to stretch out his back, I appreciated the show. He looked up when he saw me, but didn’t seem embarrassed by his undress, *damn.*

“I guess you’re not going to let me get away with letting you sleep on the couch,” he said, sighing.

“I’m supposed to take care of you Quinn,” I said sweetly, as I walked up close to him, “What if you wanted something in the middle of the night? You’d have to get up and find it yourself, or find another servant to get it for you.”

“Well, I am rather used to doing those sorts of things for myself,” he said grimacing, as he rolled one of his shoulders.

“Well, now you don’t need to do everything for yourself. Are you okay? Is there anything I can do to help,” I asked hopefully, clasping my hands in front of myself. Being this close to him, I could really appreciate why Lady Chypia was so interested. I thought she was taking a risk with someone so much larger than her, but standing in his shadow, I felt a pleasant little flutter in my stomach.

“It’s fine,” he said, “Just be glad you’re not so tall, my back aches all the time, and my joints aren’t much better.”

“Oh!” I exclaimed, “I can help, you just lay down on the bed,” and I started to push him back towards the big bed.

“Whoa, hold on there,” he said, gently pushing me back, “It’s not that you’re not beautiful Aris, because you are,” I might have turned a little bluer at that, “But I’m still not really comfortable with the arrangement you seem to be suggesting.”

I sighed and looked down dejectedly, trying to earn as many sympathy points as possible, “Well, I can still help a little then I guess. Just a massage, not anything else, I promise. Would that be okay?”

He still seemed unsure, but nodded, “Okay. But you be careful where you put your hands,” he warned, though he was smiling a little.

I got him down onto the bed, and climbed up onto his back. There was a lot of Quinn laid out on that bed, and I set to work. He seemed to be making an effort to remain quiet, but I managed to get some contented groans out of him. I didn’t blame him, his back muscles were all tense and knotted up, and I took as much time as I could kneading and rubbing with my hands. I was worried that I’d find myself back in the servants bed once I was done, but It turned out that I didn’t need to worry. I was in the middle of going over his back for a second time, just to drag things out as much as possible, when I noticed that I’d put him right to sleep.

I smiled, *perfect.*

I was very careful, pulling the blankets up over his back, and slipping under his arm. I was lying there quietly trying to get to sleep despite my quickly beating heart, I was worried that he might be angry if he woke to find me in bed with him, when he moved. I thought he was about to toss me out of bed, but instead he rolled onto his side a little, pulling me in close. My face was right up against his chest, and very carefully I slipped one of my arms around him, snuggling in. I could tell that he was still sleeping, just moving to get more comfortable, and I relaxed into him. He was so warm, and I fell asleep right there in his arms.

Pancakes, PSYCH. But srsly, I did kinda feel like this deserved the NSFW considering the rest of what was discussed.

# Chapter 19

Quinn

-----

I woke to sound of birds chirping outside, and I could feel a small, lithe form curled up against my chest.

“Mmm, Thera?” I murmured sleepily.

“Who’s Thera?”

I started awake, and looked down to see that it was Aris curled up against me.

“I thought I was rather clear about where certain people would be sleeping,” I said reproachfully.

“Well you just looked so peaceful, I didn’t want to disturb you after I’d done so much work to get you relaxed,” she said in a sweet voice.

“That sounds like a really terrible excuse,” I said wryly.

“What? Well if you don’t want me in bed with you then what’s this prodding me in the leg?” she taunted, and I had to move very quickly when she reached down to try grab it.

“Hey! Hey! Out! Out! I’m sure you have breakfast to bring me or something,” I said, voice a little higher than it normally was.

“You’re no fun,” she said, as she slipped out of the bed.

She got dressed, right in the middle of the room, and I’d be lying if I said that I didn’t watch with interest. She gave me a knowing look as she left the room, and I got out of bed and walked to the bathroom. *Is there a god of indoor plumbing?* I ran the bath, and took my time shaving and washing. I hadn’t heard Aris come back into the room, so I lay there for a while in the hot water, enjoying the solitude. I hadn’t been able to have very much time to myself since the Banestorm dropped me off. I’d been getting better about being around other people, it had been a necessity since arriving in Essens, but it still felt draining to be around others nearly every second of every day. I thought it would be bad enough with Aris sleeping in the same room, not only would it make planning my escape difficult, but it also meant that moments of solitude were even harder to come by. But now I find that she wasn’t going to settle for simply sleeping near my bed. It was almost suffocating, and that was before I even considered the fact that, oh yeah, I was a slave.

*If I can kill Nusalvo and free Concia I’ll do it, but priority one is get the fuck out of here.*

I looked at my watch.

*June-24, so… 175 days since I arrived. I should have been arriving in Nimre right about now. I’ve still got roughly eighty days until the deadline, I can do this.*

There was a knock on the door that jerked me back to reality, and I got out of the bath to dry off.

-----

I had breakfast in my room, with Aris, who apperantly wasn’t going to let me out of her sight for very long. I spent the morning going over Lady Chypia’s ledgers, copying them from the pseudo-Roman numerals into a more sane decimal notation. The hardest part was deciphering the damned things, it wasn’t as simple as a column of numbers, and it took some work to figure out what the hell each number was supposed to be so I could copy it out properly into a fresh ledger.

Chypia came in a little before lunch to see how I was doing, I think that Cusole and Erlion might have complained to her. She stood beside me, one hand on the back of my chair. Even sitting down as I was, we were at eye level.

“My scribes tell me that you’re destroying years of financial records,” she said with a smile.

I sighed, “It’s not my fault if they’re wed to a numbering system that’s ancient, cumbersome, inefficient, inconvenient, unmanageable, awkward, and slow.”

“Is that all?” She asked, raising an eyebrow?

“I’ve been making a list,” I said wryly, “But I’m not destroying anything. Their awful ledgers are still right here,” and I pointed to the massive stack of books piled on the table next to me, “I’m simply copying them out, up to the past year. There’s something like sixty years of records here, and there’s not a whole lot of point in duplicating them all, but all the most recent ledgers will actually be readable once I’m done.”

“And you prefer this way of writing numbers?” She asked, seeming unconvinced.

“No, it’s not a matter of preference. This way is better, objectively better. Cusole, or Erilon, I can’t remember, it was one of them, said that these ledgers would take weeks to sort out, like it was some point of pride. With this numbering system anyone with basic numeracy skills could understand what’s written here.”

I glance up to find that she was looking at me with an amused expression, “What?” I asked.

“I’ve just never seen someone be so passionate about numbers before,” she said, and I was sure that she was trying not to laugh.

“Why don’t I show you what I mean, it should take no time at all.”

She nodded, “Alright,” and she pulled over a chair to sit beside me.

I was true to my word, and by the time lunch arrived for the two of us Chypia seemed to grasp the idea of a positional number system, and promised that she’d instruct Cusole and Erilon to assist me in switching over her ledgers to my new system. We set the books aside to eat lunch, and Chypia continued her explanation of local Adympian politics. I’d originally been thinking of it as a country, or even a feudal empire, but neither of those were quite correct. Neither was it a centrally managed empire like ancient Rome. It was much more like the Holy Roman Empire, which despite the name was neither Holy, Roman, or an Empire. The member lords of the… *Holy Adympian Empire?* did answer to someone calling themselves an emperor, much like member lords of the Holy Roman Empire did. But much like the Holy Roman Empire the Adympian lords were semi-autonomous. It was basically a medieval European Union, which made sense considering the amount of territory that Adympia covered. It was about the same size as Russia, and trying to manage an empire of that size when your fastest way of sending orders was a guy on horseback would be nearly impossible. Eventually though, the conversation turned back towards her cousin, *second cousin?* and what I might be planning to do away with him.

“I do not mean to insult you Quinn, but you do not strike me as an assassin. How exactly do you expect to kill Nusalvo?” she asked, having ensured that only Aris and Pasa would be in a position to overhear.

“I’m not going to kill him, I’m going to build the weapon that will do it. We’ll need someone else to actually use it, someone who’s not so recognizable as myself,” I explained.

“Quinn,” she began, “Nusalvo has a substantial staff of guardsmen, and other servants that will surely get in the way. I cannot imagine any weapon that would help one person overwhelm that much opposition.”

“Ah, but that’s the trick. Going through all that opposition is foolish, an attack would surely be noticed, and whoever sent would be killed. If we do things right, he won’t even know that he’s been attacked until it’s already too late.”

This definitely got Chypia’s attention, “And just how would that work?”

I pulled out a sheaf of paper from within my tunic, setting on the table, along with a wooden walking cane that I’d had leaning against the table. I flattened out the papers, some of which were covered in equations, with the others having a diagram of the weapon. Chypia looked over the papers with equal parts interest and confusion.

“Just what is this meant to be?” She asked.

“An air rifle,” I explained, “One built to fit inside of this cane, or one like it. It won’t be very powerful, and it will launch a needle instead of a bullet, but then it doesn’t need to be very powerful.”

“You expect to shoot him in the eye with this?” She asked, sceptically.

“Not quite, the needle will be coated in poison, and the shot will go into his leg. Done right, he might confuse the pain for a bee sting, or not even notice it if we can find some way to distract him suitably.”

“So you also know about poisons now?”

“The fruits of a misspent youth,” I said smiling.

“And youths where you come from normally learn all about poisons, do they?” She asked, amused.

“Well, not exactly. Remind me to tell you about the internet some time. The particular poison I have in mind should be locally available, relatively easy to manufacture in small quantities, and hopefully unknown.”

“And this poison is called?” She asked, I seemed to have her full attention now.

“Ricin, it’s made from castor beans and has no known antidote. Maybe Nusalvo has access to some magical healing, like the salve you used on my wrists the first night I was here, but Ricin is just about the most toxic natural poison that exists. It is somewhat slower acting, but to someone unfamiliar with the symptoms of Ricin poisoning, it will look like the victim fell ill suddenly. Granted, I imagine that there will be some suspicion, considering his position and how suddenly he would fall ill, but I think that handling the political side of things would probably be up to you.”

“Castor beans? I have heard of them used as a poison, but it requires the person to actually be tricked into eating the ground up seeds, and even then it’s not terribly reliable,” Chypia said, thoughtful, but also a little disappointed, “Have you really thought this through Quinn?”

“Yes, there are two issues with castor beans on their own that I plan to solve. The first is that the beans only have a small amount of poison each, and trying to get it to someone in the form of ground up beans is not very convenient. Instead, assuming I can get the right equipment, I can concentrate the poison. The second is that both the castor beans and the ricin are hard for the body to digest, which means that even if they eat it, they might not get a full dose. That’s the reason for the air gun, injection is much more reliable, and we don’t need to get someone in place to put the poison in his food. Assuming of course, he can’t just magic himself better, that’s the thing I’m not sure about.”

“If you did intend to put it in his food then yes, magic would be a problem, but if it’s being injected then there is not much that can be done to fix the damage,” She said. Her expression was dark, but I got the impression that she was getting a little excited.

“What do you mean?”

“There are enchantments that can be used to check food for poisons, which would detect the poison immediately. Nearly every noble in Adympia uses some version of the enchantment, I have Aris and Pasa check all the food they serve for example. They each carry a ring with the enchantment,” She said, nodding towards the two of them, “but magical healing is very limited. Flesh wounds and scars can be fixed, but any damage to the organs, lost limbs, or anything else that’s too complex can’t be healed with magic.”

*I’ll have to file that information away for later.*

I smiled, “Well if every noble is running around with poison detecting rings, then I bet there’s not been a whole lot of effort put into researching poisons.”

“No, and I’ve not heard of the use of poisoned weapons by anyone other than orc or goblin tribes. I’m pleased Quinn, this might work,” she praised.

“Well then, I’ve got a shopping list, do you have someone you can send out to get these things?” I asked, offering up the list.

I’d written the specifications of the parts I needed rather more technically than strictly necessary, if I’d done things right…

“I do, but some of these things seem rather specific. It might be best if collected these things yourself, Aris should be able to guide you around the city,” she said.

*Perfect, being able to move around the city should make planning my escape much easier.*

“Alright, this does leave the second objective unsolved though, and I’ll admit that I’ve not got many ideas.”

“You mean rescuing my sister,” she said quietly.

“Yeah, mainly it comes down to what happens once Nusalvo is dead. I guess you’d inherit all of his things? But then you’re not supposed to have possession of Concia, are you?”

“No, but there will be some leeway. The process of managing the inheritance should take a few days, so we might have some chance to work out… something,” the subject was clearly making her feel uncomfortable.

“Let me worry about that then, I’ve got some time to think about this.”

She stood, nodding. She pulled me into her chest, hugging me, “Thank you Quinn.”

-----

It took over a week to assemble all of the tools and equipment I’d need for my plan. Chypia had given me quite a substantial budget for the project, and I’d hoped to be able to just buy most of the parts I’d need. I didn’t have much luck though, and while I could get the materials in about the precision I wanted, I was going to end up making the parts myself. I’d set up my workshop on the first floor below my bedroom, and while I didn’t have a forge, I had just about every other metalworking tool, woodworking tool, and piece of chemistry equipment that I could get my hands on.

*We’re gonna need a…* ***montage.***


# Chapter 20

Lady Chypia

-----

“And he’s still not started with the poisons?” I asked Enes.

“No m’Lady, Aris might be able to explain it better since she’s been sitting and watching almost constantly, but nothing he’s made so far looks very much like a weapon either,” she said, stiffly as ever.

“I’m not disparaging your abilities Enes, but are you sure? He might be familiar with weapons that are entirely foreign to us, he is an outsider after all.”

“Yes, Aris and I have been keeping a close eye on him. I’ve made sure to go out with the two of them whenever Quinn leaves to gather more materials. Aris has also been with nearly every second of every day since she started serving him, and unless she’s told you differently he’s not been smuggling anything else in,” she reported, “We might just ask Quinn, he seems eager to show off the things he’s making, even if what he’s making doesn’t seem to make much sense to anyone but himself.

“Mmm, it’s about time I check on him myself anyways. Good work Enes,” I praised.

“Thank you m’Lady,” she replied, no less stiffly than before.

Enes fell in behind me as I went to check on Quinn.

-----

I stepped into the little workshop, and was rather amused by what I found. Aris was curled up on one of the chairs, peeking over the backrest and looking towards where Quinn was standing. He was facing towards the far end of the room where he’d set several of my ledgers on the shelf that ran along the wall, and he was holding a long tube to his mouth.

*My ledgers? What in the world…*

Quinn took a deep breath, then there was a hiss of air, and a ‘thwippp’ sound as a shiny bronze dart suddenly sprouted from the cover of one of my ledgers.

“Quinn…” I said quietly, “Are those my ledgers?”

He turned around quickly to see myself and Enes standing in the doorway, “I made a blowgun!” He said excitedly, “Want to try it Enes?”

I sighed, Enes was normally as stoic as a statue, but hand her a new toy and she turned into an excited little girl. She was grinning like an idiot as Quinn explained the weapon to her.

“You’ll want to take a deep breath before firing,” he was saying, “But don’t breathe in through the pipe, otherwise you’ll suck the dart into your mouth. Yeah, just like that. Hold it in both hands, level it at one of the targets…”

There was a hiss and a ‘thwippp’ and another dart sprouted from another ledger.

“I’m surprised,” Enes said, as the two walked up towards the ‘targets’ to inspect the damage, “This is much more powerful that you’d think, is there nothing else driving the dart forwards?” She pried out one of the darts, it was about three inches long and nearly half of its length had been buried in the ledger.

“Nope, just your breath. This isn’t even that big as blowguns are concerned. A really big blowgun might be six feet long, and it would fire six inch long darts. It’s still not very practical compared to something like a crossbow, but it’s about as quiet as any weapon can get.”

“And you plan to use this to deliver the poison?” Enes asked, “You’re right about how quiet it is, but standing in the middle of the street while pointing a three foot long tube at Nusalvo might draw attention.”

“Well, yeah, but I only made this to test how precise I could be with the tools and materials I’ve got. The barrel needs to be pretty uniform, and matched very closely to the width of the dart. If it’s off by too much then most of the air will just pass around the dart, and won’t drive it forwards. Now that I’ve got this sorted I can work on some way of storing air in a reservoir, so all it takes is for the user to open a valve, instead of holding it to their lips. This needs to be covert after all, ideally the weapon could be used in a crowd, by someone passing him on the street.”

“Lady Chypia mentioned that you wanted to do something like that, do you really think that would work? I find it hard to imagine not noticing one of these sticking out of my leg though,” Enes said, gesturing with the dart in her hand.

I leaned back against the wall, sighing, at least Enes seemed to be enjoying herself. Amas would be disappointed that her sister was the one to have all the fun.

“Well I’m actually basing the plan of off an assassination that happened on my own world. Granted, they didn’t use a massive bronze spike either, they used a tiny little pellet. I can’t quite match that, I don’t think I can make the pellet small enough while also carrying enough poison, but I should be able to manage with something about this size,” he said, holding up a very fine needle, about an inch long, “The victim in the assassination I’m basing my plan on originally thought that he’d been bitten by a bug, and it wasn’t until after that he realized he’d been poisoned. They even disguised the weapon like I’m doing here, though they hid the airgun in an umbrella instead of a cane.”

“Umbrella?” Enes asked.

“Ah, it’s like a parasol, but meant to keep off rain instead of the sun.”

“Air gun?”

“Right,” he said, snapping his fingers and then hurriedly picking through the things on the workbench, “Here we are, I mentioned storing air in a reservoir, that’s what these are.”

He held out a short bronze cylinder and a long leather pouch to Enes, “Air is stored under pressure in, well, one of these. I’ll need to figure out which. It’s released by opening a valve, something I also need to figure out, and then it’s forced through the barrel. That launches the needle, hopefully.”

“How is this held together?” Enes asked, taking the little bronze tube and turning it over in her hands.

“It’s soldered together. Soldering isn’t nearly as strong as welding, but it’s a lot easier. Imagine trying to weld together an egg. I’m just not that good a blacksmith to do work that precise.”

“Is this just hammered bronze?”

“Yeah, the thinnest and most flexible I could find, bent into a tube. The soldering is done with molten lead, that’s also how the end caps are held on. It’s not great, but it can hold pressure longer than the little leather pouch can,” he said.

Enes set the bronze bit of metal down on the workbench and took up the bit of leather, “This just looks like a very small wineskin.”

“That’s basically all it is, it can hold more pressure than the metal canister can but it leaks constantly and I can’t figure out how to seal it any better than I already have.”

I wasn’t about to get a word in anytime soon, so I departed gracefully, leaving Quinn in Enes’s capable hands for the time being.

-----

Quinn was definitely an odd one, and that was even more clear when he thought that he was alone. It was something I’d noticed early on, it was maybe the second or third day after he said he’d help me kill Nusalvo and rescue Concia. Aris had gone to get him lunch and Enes had gone to relieve herself which left him alone in the library for maybe the first time since he’d arrived. I’d hoped to catch him unawares, in the middle of plotting some sort of escape or rebellion. Reworking all of my ledgers, throwing himself into the task of killing my enemies and freeing my sister, it seemed all too easy. I was inclined to let him do it, if only because I would take any opportunity to help my sister, but I was no fool. I’d thought that he was putting on a face as he worked for me, so eager to solve my problems. As it turned out, I was right, though not in the way I’d imagined.

He normally seemed to be almost innocently committed to whatever he was doing, and genuinely happy to do the work and to explain it to those that would listen. He was calm, and the only time I’d ever seen him be any different was when he was arguing with Cusole about the best way to write the ledgers. Well, there was also the first night when I’d mistakenly handed him the knife. I expected to see that darker side of him again once he thought that no one was watching, but instead he seemed almost vulnerable. He didn’t leap up to dig through a secret cache of supplies, instead he stayed right where he was and seemed to draw inwards. His normally straight back was hunched over, and his broad shoulders were pulled in. It made him look smaller than he really was, and it drew attention to how slim his arms and legs were. Instead of the usual small smile, his expression was almost flat. Most of it had indeed been an act, though not in the way that I’d thought.

I’d been sure to pay more attention over the next two weeks as he was gathering material for, and set to work on, what I now knew was the blowgun. Whenever Aris and Enes would both be out of the room, I’d be sure to watch covertly. I still wanted to be sure that he wasn’t planning escape, but now I also wanted to know just what made him tic. Trying to hide any rebellious intent was one thing, but that’s not what he seemed to be doing. Instead he was hiding what exactly? That he wasn’t happy? Most people could be forgiven for not being totally pleased to be made a slave, even if it was a life of luxury, it took time to adjust. The only time he didn’t seem to be acting was when he was showing off something he’d made, or something he’d done, like reworking the ledgers. The rest of the time though, he was wearing his happy face.

*Oh I think I know just what will cheer him up*

It was the evening after showing Enes the blowgun, Quinn sequestered himself in the library like he always did in the evening. It seemed to be his sanctuary, more so even than his bedroom, and he’d often stay up late reading whatever books he pulled off of the shelf. I decided to take advantage of my well timed observation, and saw to it that Aris and Enes would be elsewhere while I cheered Quinn up.

I was barefoot as I stalked through the library, and had chosen a blue silk nightie for the occasion. It was nothing too immodest, though it was rather short, and I wasn’t wearing anything underneath. To complete the look I’d taken out my hair pins, letting my long hair fall in tousled curls down past my shoulders. The sun had just gone down below the horizon as I crept up behind Quinn, and I found him sitting in an armchair reading by candle light.

*Perfect.*

I was very quiet as I crept up behind him, Quinn seemed to make up for poor vision with surprisingly good hearing, and I didn’t want him to have a chance to put his face back on before I caught him. His book was held in his lap, and he was hunched over reading. I decided on tender instead of vampy, it seemed like Quinn might be a little more receptive to that sort of treatment. I slipped up beside him, on the side away from the light.

“Quinn,” I said quietly, as I placed a gentle hand on the back of his head, running my fingers through his thick brown hair, “Are you alright?”

He seemed a little startled to see me there, but didn’t put his face back on, “Uh yeah, I guess.”

He leaned backwards, stretching tiredly, and I took advantage of the opening. I slipped over the arm of the chair and sat across his lap. I put one arm around his neck, the other hand stroking his hair.

“Are you sure Quinn?” I said softly, “I worry about you, and you always seem a little… Not sad, but tense, when you think no one else is watching. What’s wrong Quinn? I know it’s hard to adjust sometimes, is there anything I can do for you to make you feel better?”

He was looking down, not meeting my eyes as I spoke, this was the side of him that he’d been hiding away.

“It’s not really the change that gets to me,” he said, still not meeting my eyes, “Hell, if I hadn’t met you I’d have just ended up doing the same sort of stuff for someone else. It’s just that I’m not used to being around people so much.”

“What do you mean?” I asked, shifting around in his lap in a way that was meant to be enticing.

He let out a breath, relaxing a little, “I’m just used to being alone most times. I find it a little, draining, to have to interact with people all the time. And between Aris and Enes I’ve not had more than a few minutes alone since I landed on the beach. I get it, I understand why they’re following me around, but it feels suffocating. I hope I haven’t been insulting to them at all, I’ve been trying to make an effort not to be rude, but sometimes I just want them to leave me alone.”

“No, I don’t think you’ve been rude to them Quinn. Are all humans so solitary?”

“No, compared to other humans I’m definitely not normal,” he said, rather bitterly.

I lifted his chin with one gentle hand, to meet his eyes, “Do you want me to leave you alone?”

He was quiet for a moment, then looked away shyly, “No.”

I leaned in, lips just brushing the nape of his neck, “Well then, how about this. If you promise to be very good and do as I say, I’ll let Aris and Enes have a break, and I’ll keep an eye on you myself. Just you and me, with no one else around to bother you. Would you like that?”

*And he’s almost…*

“Yeah,” he said, in a hoarse whisper.

“Promise,” I instructed.

“I promise,” he said.

“You promise to do what?” I prompted.

“I promise to be good… and to do as you say,” he said, in the same hoarse whisper.

*…mine*

“Good, now pick me up,” I instructed, “And carry me to my bedroom.”

He did as he was told, and I wrapped my arms tightly around his neck as I was lifted into the air. It was exhilarating, and a little frightening. I felt like a child in his arms, but I knew that I was the one in control now. He carried me to the doorway, and peeked out a little awkwardly.

“You wouldn’t be embarrassed if someone saw us would you?” I asked, knowing the answer.

“I’m… a very private person,” he said, a little unsteadily.

“Well as long as you’re good Quinn, I’ll make sure that you don’t get embarrassed. You will be good won’t you Quinn?”

“Yes,” he said, stepping into the hall, and walking towards my bedroom.

“Yes what?” I prompted.

“Yes Lady Chypia.”

“Very good Quinn, but since you’re going to be behaving yourself you can call me m’Lady,” I said graciously.

“Yes m’Lady.”

Quinn carried me into my bedroom, and as planned Pasa was elsewhere. Moonlight and a cool breeze streamed in through massive windows, and Pasa had left several candles burning before she’d left.

“Set me down on the bed,” I instructed.

He did as he was told, but when he went to let me go I took hold of his tunic in both hands, and dragged him down onto the bed next to me. He was surprisingly light for someone so large, and I pressed his back down onto the bed. I pulled myself up onto him, straddling his upper chest. I pulled my nightie up over my head, and took hold of Quinn’s hair in both hands. I considered, for a heated moment, hauling myself just a bit forwards.

*Tender. Remember, tender. For now.*

I relaxed my grip on his hair, and stroked it instead. He did seem awfully young, *how young I wonder?* “Have you ever been with a woman before Quinn?”

He turned absolutely bright red, and I had to work to keep my smile sweet instead of predatory, “Uh, no, not really.”

*Oh my dear Quinn. I am going to twist you up in knots, I’ll have you eating out of my hand by the time I’m done with you. This is so much better than whips and chains.*

I leaned down to kiss him lightly on the lips, my hair falling around him. He brought a hand up to the back of my neck, gently pulling me deeper into the kiss. I let him, and an involuntary shiver ran through me. Nearly three weeks, it almost never took this long for the first time, but then I hadn’t really understood him very well. Most men you wave a willing and beautiful woman in front of will jump on her at the first opportunity. It was rare that I had to take matters in my own hands, usually I let Aris or Pasa be the one to do it, but oh Verrin. I am going to enjoy this.

I pulled back from the kiss, and took in the wonderful expression on Quinn’s face. His lips were a little puffy from kissing, eyes were unfocused, and face flushed. I pulled at his clothes, finding the knot that held the tunic shut and tearing at it desperately. I got it loose and flung the short silk rope away from the bed. My mouth hung open and I was salivating as I finally pulled the tunic open. I lifted myself up, luxuriating in just how much there was to play with, he seemed to stretch out endlessly. I was tiny compared to Quinn, but having so much man under my control felt fantastic. I lowered myself down, impaling myself on Quinn, and I shuddered as he entered me. It was almost more than I could take.

*Oh, to hell with tender.*

Quinn’s hands found my hips, and the almost circled my narrow waist. I put my hands on his chest, lifting myself up and down, up and down, over and over and over and over. I should have paced myself, I didn’t want it to end too soon, but I’d been waiting for this moment for weeks. I didn’t slow, I didn’t stop, instead I quickened my pace, taking in all of him as quickly as I could.

“Mmmaanghhh- Ohh Verrin, Ohh Q-Quinn,” I gasped out, “Hhh-Ohhhh”

I held on as best I could. My toes curled almost painfully, and my back arched as I dragged my fingernails across Quinn’s chest. I fell forwards limply, unable to hold myself up anymore. It seemed that Quinn wasn’t quite done with me though, and he wasn’t about to let it end. His grip tightened on my waist, and it was his turn to lift me up and down, up and down, over and over and over and- *Oh Verrin!* It was almost overwhelming, and I clawed weakly at his chest and shoulders as he did as he pleased with my body.

I **wanted** him so much, and I found myself biting at his chest. My teeth found his collar bone and I latched on. I was sure that I was being too rough, and that in a second my mouth would be full of the taste of blood, but I did **not** care.

By the time he was finally done with me I was as limp as a ragdoll, and my whole body was quivering. I could barely think, let alone see, and yet I still could have done with more. I tried to form the words that would order him to continue, beg him to continue, but it just came out as a lewd moan. I couldn’t see through the splotches of colour that filled my vision, but I felt Quinn draw me in. I pulled myself towards the scent of his body. He was hot to the touch, and I curled up close to him, the heat of him banishing the cold of the cool night air.

-----

I woke several hours later, as the sun rose to light the large bedroom. I found myself curled up against Quinn, laying atop the covers. I sat up slowly, stretching contentedly. Every muscle felt… loose, and there was a sort of pleasant tiredness. I cast my gaze over Quinn’s still sleeping form. Some part of me, the tiny part that wasn’t being overwhelmed by the experience, had worried that I might have lost some measure of control as I mewled and begged for more all through last night. I need not have worried though, and the proof was all over Quinn’s body. I’d left claw marks all up and down his shoulders, chest, and sides. There were a collection of bite marks all along both collar bones.

*Mmm, oh yes. Now there’s some proof of ownership, who needs a brand?*

I did feel slightly sorry for him though. I had not been gentle with him, and while I didn’t taste blood in my mouth, the bite marks would take some time to heal. I could already see dark bruises forming where I’d bitten him. For a moment I considered getting the jar of healing salve from my bureau, but eventually decided against it. He was going to feel every twinge of pain, the tenderness where he’d bruised, the stinging as his clothes rubbed against the scratches, and remember just who owned him.

There was one mark though, that was out of place. A long scar, running from just under one pectoral, and down to the corner of his hip. It had been closed properly, though crudely, I could see the crisscrossing marks that had been left by the stitches. The scar was a livid, puckered, red line. I’d need to have that healed properly. I couldn’t have him bearing marks left by another, and it was the one ugly mark on an otherwise beautiful specimen. I traced one finger along the scar, it looked to have been left by some sort of blade, there was surely a story there. Quinn twinged slightly as I traced the scar down to his hip, it seemed that he was a little ticklish. He stirred awake, and rubbed at his eyes.

“You are very demanding of your servants m’Lady,” he said, by way of greeting.

“That’s a rather polite way to put it I think Quinn,” I said vampishly.

He looked down at his chest, and shifted slightly in the bed, “Well if this is what I get for doing as commanded then I don’t ever want to find out what happens if I deny you satisfaction,” he said, wearing a satisfied smile.

I lay back down, resting my head on his shoulder, though I was careful not to aggravate his bruises, “Are all humans quite so… everything?” I said, gesturing towards the implement of my pleasure.

He bit his lower lip, turning a little pink, “I’d like to say that I’m some paragon of human masculinity, but really I’m pretty average unfortunately. I’m definitely really tall for a human, but beyond that I’m not too special as humans go.”

“Mmm, well. I think I’m definitely a fan of your size.”

I let out a long sigh, looking towards the clock on the far wall.

“Something wrong, m’Lady?” he asked.

“Oh, I’ve just got a meeting with some cloth merchants this afternoon. I’m going to need to bathe and get dressed eventually,” I looked at Quinn, this would be a perfect chance to show him off for the first time, “I think I’d like you to check their figures for me, you can do that for me can’t you Quinn?”

“Oh?” He asked, “Well if it’s anything like checking your figure was then I’m sure I’ll have no trouble. M’Lady.”

*Give them one good tumble, and all of a sudden...* Well, it wasn’t like I didn’t enjoy the way that he was enjoying me.

“I’m thinking of sponsoring their little guild, and I want to be sure that I’m not going to be cheated. Just think, you’ll have another chance to show off your new numbering system.”

Quinn smiled at that, which was good, I wasn’t sure how he’d feel about meeting yet more people, “Yes m’Lady,” he said.

“Good, now pick me up,” I instructed.

He raised an eyebrow, but did as he was told.

“Now, carry me to my bathroom. Aris and Pasa aren’t here, so you’ll just have to do.”

It took nearly an hour longer than usual for me to finally stumble out of the bathroom on weak knees, but oh dear Verrin, Quinn was much more fun in the bath than Aris or Pasa ever were.

# Chapter 21

Quinn

-----

The more I thought about it, the more I realized how terrible an idea it was to let Lady Chypia ‘seduce’ me. I’d thought that it would be a good way to get her to trust me, after all, if she thought that I was well in hand then she’d not be keeping as close an eye on me. And to some extent, that was true. The difference was clear, and immediate, I had more or less free reign in the grounds of the manor. No longer was Aris following me around all the time, and when I was working in the little workshop I’d set up I didn’t have Enes watching constantly.

I wanted her to underestimate me, so I did my best to act vulnerable and awkward If I could make her think that I felt uncomfortable around anyone other than herself then she’d conclude that I was basically hers already. After all, what’s better than a slave that runs **towards** you, and only you, when seeking comfort and safety. The trouble was, it hadn’t taken a whole hell of a lot of acting on my part, and that scared the hell out of me. In trying to get her to underestimate me I’d in fact been underestimating her, or at least overestimating myself. I really was vulnerable and awkward, and I really did feel uncomfortable around most people. I’d wanted to trick Lady Chypia into thinking that she was one of the few people I felt okay around, and I was fairly sure that I’d convinced her, but was it really a trick, if that was how I really felt?

*I should have paid more attention to what Thera said. I really am naïve when it comes to this sort of thing. Is that all it takes? For a pretty woman to show a modicum of interest, and provide the tiniest amount of emotional support?*

After Thera and Lady Chypia, and the clear interest shown by both Sila and Aris I’d been starting to think of myself differently. Less awkward loner, and more medieval Captain Kirk. The more I thought about it, the more I realized that this was not the case. Thera had been right, it was fairly easy for others to take advantage of my naiveté. Sila had been looking for literally any alternative to what would have been several decades of domestic abuse. Aris had thought of sleeping with me as just part of the job. Lady Chypia wanted some way to exercise control, and to make me more loyal. Thera had wanted to scratch an itch, and for all I knew she’d jumped on the first mildly attractive non-city elf to walk through the door.

I was probably being too harsh, especially to Thera, but I was a little caught up wallowing in my own self doubt.

*And what the hell is my escape plan again?*

I’d seized upon the idea of killing Nusalvo to ingratiate myself to Lady Chypia, but that was another idea that was revealed to be terrible as I thought about it more. What, was it going to cause chaos? Well maybe, but he was the heir, not the Marquis. The rest of the city would keep ticking along as usual. It would give me a chance to help out Lady Chypia’s sister, but why was I doing that again? Slavery, especially the sort that Concia seemed to be a victim of, was pretty damn high on my list of ‘fates comparable to death’, but she was by no means the only Mage that needed help. She probably wasn’t even the easiest to rescue. I’d guess that Lady Chypia would want to take the opportunity to get her sister out of the city, and I was right, but that didn’t help me much. I’d imagined me tagging along when Concia was whisked out, but that idea didn’t hold up though.

Lady Chypia would arrange for Concia to escape Nusalvo’s manor while it was still being worked out what to do with her, this was the first hurdle. The second hurdle being the city gates, and Lady Chypia would likely be able to arrange for some guard to be looking the other way while Concia slipped out. Then Concia would run like hell to Nimre, or even just Ashur, and she’d be safe. There were two problems with trying to crash the little freedom party though. The first was that at no point in the escape plan would I be very helpful. Arranging the escape? Maybe, but I was Lady Chypia’s steward, and it would be odd for me to be missing during the transition. I’d probably have my hands full helping to sort the inheritance out. Better to pick someone that wouldn’t be missed, maybe Enes or Amas, especially since they’d be able to handle any opposition that they might face. Unarmed against an unskilled opponent I’d be fine, but that was a low damn bar, and if there was opposition it wasn’t going to be unskilled and it sure as hell wouldn’t be unarmed. No, I couldn’t insert myself there. Could I help get Concia past the city gates? No, that was even more laughable. I’d had some grand designs involving an improvised gunpowder firework, but it was foolishness. Lady Chypia had the contacts, and knew the right sort of people. Some bribe or favour, and the way would be clear, and it wouldn’t draw nearly as much attention as my idea. She might not even need to bribe anyone if she happened to know of some gap in the guard rotation, or of some hidden passage out of the city. It was when I considered Concia’s overland escape to Ashur or Nimre that I realized the bigger problem.

If what I’d heard about the way that Mages were treated was true then there was no way in hell that Concia would be in a state to get herself out of the city, and to the border. Just for me, it would be five or six days, and that was at double the normal elf traveling pace. She probably wouldn’t be able to manage even that, and she’d probably need to dodge whatever search parties were sent out to catch her once it was realized that she’d escaped. No, Lady Chypia would send her with someone, probably several someones, and none of them would be me. Why would she even consider it? From her perspective not only was I very valuable, I was also probably one of the least prepared people for this sort of operation. Over long distances I was pretty sure I could keep ahead of whatever tracking parties were sent after myself, but that didn’t help Concia any. Bluffing her into thinking I was some great warrior wasn’t going to work either, and she already knew that the only weapon I was familiar with had been a hobby. If she’d wanted an archer along then anyone who did it professionally would be a much better pick.

No. I’d be staying here when Concia escaped.

*Lady Chypia really has been turning me to her side, the only one I’ve been pretending to is myself. I need to get the hell out of here, no more screwing around with air guns and half assed plans.*

It was sixty two days until the deadline, and it would take eighteen days to get to Nimre on foot. That left forty four days to come up with a **real** plan that wasn’t some James Bond level bullshit. Less even than that, leaving forty four days from now would put me in Nimre on the day of the deadline around lunch time. That left no room for error, and for all I knew they closed up early on the last day. I wouldn’t be leaving forty four days from now, I’d be leaving as soon as I had a decent chance of escape.

One, I needed six days of food to get me out of Adympia. I wasn’t going to be able to stop at inns along the way to sleep and eat.

Sleeping, that was two. I needed some form of shelter that was quick to set up and tear down for those same six days.

Three, I needed money. I’d been working on that already, Lady Chypia had given me quite a large budget for my airgun and I might have been embezzling it a little.

Four, I needed to get these damnable cuffs off. I’d already tried the trick with the metal file, and it had not gone well. I’d snuck it into the bathroom inside my tunic and had timed my progress on my watch, I wanted some idea of how long it would take to get these off when it came time. For sixty seconds I’d scraped away with the file, working just on the edge near my wrist, I didn’t want anyone to notice any suspicious marks left on the cuff. I need not have worried, in the sixty seconds I’d timed it for I’d barely scuffed the cuff. It wasn’t zero progress, but this was not the solution I was looking for. The cuffs looked and felt like gold, they were even the right weight, but they were far too tough. It was probably the enchantment I’d first detected weeks ago. The enchantment probably also accounted for how comfortable the cuffs were. By all rights they should have rubbed my wrists raw, I’d been wearing them every hour of the day for weeks, and padding was only going to help so much.

Five, I needed to get the hell out of the city. Walking out the front gates was not going to be an option, cuffs or not, illusion or not. The guards would check to see if any of those leaving had cuffs on, and in theory if you were un-cuffed you’d be free to leave. Unfortunately, I was somewhat conspicuous, and I’d be recognized. I’d spent the past two and a half weeks stumbling around the city, looking for material, and people knew that I belonged to Lady Chypia. An illusion was similarly useless, at least if I wanted to leave through one of the gates. I’d feared some sort of city wide magic detection grid when I’d first used Detect Magic on the cuffs, and while there wasn’t such a grid over the whole city, there was some sort of detection system in place at each of the gates.

“Quinn?”

I had a solid plan for three, maybe one and two as well, but four and five were going to take some work.

“Quinn?” Lady Chypia said, pulling me out of my thoughts, “Are you alright? You’re sweating.”

We’d been walking through what felt like the equivalent to an ancient industrial park, though industrial was probably the wrong word. From what I could tell most ‘factories’ were just warehouses full of slaves working by hand. The closest thing that the Adympians had to machinery was the few mills in the city, and they weren’t terribly impressive. Just a big water wheel, some very basic gearing, and a big damn rock. Lady Chypia had taken me with her when she went to inspect the facilities in use by her potential business partners. I’d gotten lost in thought on our way back to the carriage, and it seemed that Lady Chypia had noticed.

“Sorry,” I said, stepping closer to her, “Just a little distracted, it’s a little crowded here.”

Even though most slaves would still be working in the factories at this hour, the streets were very busy. Enes and Amas were doing their job and keeping the rabble some distance back, but the street was as crowded as any in Toronto.

“Don’t worry,” she said, taking my arm, “The carriage is just ahead, and the merchants are only sending two of their number. I trust that you’re still going to be looking over their ledgers for me?”

“Of course,” I said, and I berated myself mentally for how eagerly I’d responded.

I paid a little more attention to my surroundings, keeping my head up. Like the other elves cities I’d visited this place seemed to be very clean compared to what I’d heard of cities even as modern as Victorian London. I don’t think I could have put up with a city where people threw their garbage and sewage out into the street, and where cholera and other diseases ran rampant. Even here among the factories everything was rather well kept. There were no trees or other greenery lining the streets, but it was kept clean at least.

“What does that marking mean?” I asked, gesturing towards one of the mills. This one, like most of the other’s I’d seen, had the doors chained shut and a sign nailed to the wall. On the sign was a roughly painted little anvil, though some of the other signs had scissors or bottles instead of the little anvil.

“Hmmm? Oh, that’s the mark of the blacksmith’s guild. The mill owner likely found their debts to be too much for them and had to close up shop. Usually when that happens their slaves and assets are sold off to try to pay back some of their creditors. It looks like they couldn’t find a buyer for the mill, so they just handed the whole building over to the blacksmith’s guild. They don’t seem to want the mill either, that sign lets potential buyers know where to look if they’d like to make an offer,” Lady Chypia explained.

*Abandoned mill? Now there’s an idea…*

“Why are so many of them locked up? I thought that food would be the sort of thing that’s always in demand.”

“Oh it is, but business is moving elsewhere. The city used to import most of its grain from Ashur, and it would come in by sea, then be milled into flour here in the city. The political situation has been a little complicated of late though, and while there’s no embargo, there are many fewer ships bringing in grain. Instead most of the grain comes in by land now, from the nearby farming villages, and much of it is already milled into flour before it gets here.”

“So a lot of the mills are having a hard time staying in business, and when they go out of business no one wants to bother buying the buildings. Couldn’t they just be converted into factory space?”

“Maybe, but the creditors want their money’s worth out of the buildings. It costs them little to wait things out, and the situation with Ashur will be resolved eventually. Why, did you have some use in mind for them? Some innovation from your world?”

I let out a breath, “I don’t really know. There’s plenty that humans have used water power for over our history, I’m just not that familiar with the specifics. You use it to turn the millstones, we use it to generate electricity. I could probably work out how to do either, it’s everything in between that I don’t know about. I know that those looms the girls were working could be powered from the water wheel somehow, but it’s been a couple hundred years since that sort of technology was in use, I’d need to spend some time thinking about it.”

Enes pulled open the door to the carriage and I let Lady Chypia enter first. I was about to take a seat across from her, when she patted the bench beside her. I sat down, and she took my arm again.

“A couple hundred years? That’s not very long Quinn, you might be young, but you must remember something.” she said.

“A couple hundred years might not be that long for an elf, but for a human that’s three or four lifetimes.”

“What?” Lady Chypia exclaimed, seeming genuinely surprised.

*Whoops, is this going to be a problem?*

“Humans don’t live nearly as long as elves do. I’m only twenty two, if you take really good care of me I might live for another sixty or so years. Without proper medicine, or I guess magic, I’d probably only get another forty, maybe fifty years if I was careful. Even then, I’m probably at my physical peak right now. I’m in damn good shape, but I can only keep that up for so long. In ten years I’ll probably be more or less where I am now, but I’ll look noticeably older. Ten years after that and I might not be able to keep up quite the same pace, and I’ll definitely look older then. That’s not to say that I’d fall apart, but it would certainly be more challenging to stay in shape than it is now.”

It seemed to take a moment for Lady Chypia to process all of this, and I felt her grip tighten on my arm.

“That’s not fair,” She said, seeming angry, “I deserve more than a few decades from you.”

“Sorry m’Lady. But there’s not really anything to be done about that,” I said, with a bittersweet smile. I was after all, incredibly jealous of just how long lived the elves were.

“Yes there is,” she said sharply, and her grip became painfully tight on my arm, “I’ll need to find a Mage that can cast the proper spell, but I’m not about to let you waste away before my eyes.”

*What?*

“What?” I asked, a little bewildered.

Lady Chypia let go of my arm, and cupped my face in her hands, “You’re mine Quinn, and I plan to have you around for a very long time.”

-----

-----

Cusole, Erilon, and I had the clothier’s ledgers spread out on one of the tables in the library. I could hear Lady Chypia’s conversation with the two men through the open door to the sitting room, and from the feel of things I guessed that this business deal was more like an acquisition. This explained Lady Chypia’s interest in their books, they’d be her books soon if all went well. Cusole and Erilon had not been difficult to bring around to my way of thinking once I had Lady Chypia’s seal of approval, and between the three of us we got through the ledgers rather quickly. We went over each one twice before the meeting was finished, and I was briefly disappointed that I didn’t find anything nefarious on the part of the merchants. Then I kicked myself. Dammit I was **not** looking for ways to impress Lady Chypia.

The meeting went well, and while nothing was decided for certain, Lady Chypia acquiring their little business seemed to be a forgone conclusion. I spent what was left of the day trying to figure out real solutions to my actual problems. It wasn’t like food would be hard to get my hands on, and I could work something out for sleeping accommodations, but whatever I made or gathered I needed to be able to pass off as something else or hide. That was true for all of my problems, I had the means and materials to build a big damn rope ladder for climbing the city wall, but if anyone else saw what I’d made then they might get just a little suspicions.

I was going to finish the air gun before I left, really all I had left to do was prepare the poison and figure out how to build the valve. I’d leave that night, assuming I had solved problems four and five. It should be enough to help Concia, Lady Chypia could find someone to use the gun, and from there she’d be able to get her sister out of the city on her own.

-----

I took dinner with Lady Chypia that evening, and I thought that I’d get away with reading for a while before bed, but no such luck. Lady Chypia seemed eager to turn in early, and as of now I was apparently sleeping in her room. I felt more than a little conflicted with this idea. On the one hand, high school Quinn would have killed for thirty seconds with Lady Chypia, but on the other hand the whole situation made me feel a little sick. I was definitely not in control here, and the same situation that had made me feel uncomfortable when Aris and Pasa threw themselves at me, now applied to me.

Well if I had to do this, then I was going to do it my way. She’d pushed me back down onto the bed, clearly expecting me to wait for her attention, and then she went to get something out of a desk drawer. She was bent over, facing away from me, and the little pink nightie rode up a little which gave me a rather nice view. I hopped up out of bed as quietly as I could, and stalked up behind her. I wrapped both my arms around her waist, and hauled her off her feet. She let out a surprised cry, loud enough that I was briefly struck with the image of Amas and Enes bursting into the room, and I threw her over my shoulder. I carried her into the bathroom, and opened one of the taps on the huge tub. I sat her down roughly, but not too roughly, on the counter. Her face was flushed and her hair was mussed. Her mouth was just slightly open, and she was looking at me through half-lidded eyes. I pushed her back with one hand, and her back thumped against the wall. She tilted her head back, and bit at her lower lip, clearly excited. She lunged forwards, trying to wrap her arms around my neck, drawing me into a kiss. I caught her by the neck with one hand, and pushed her back against the wall. She grabbed my arm with both hands, trying to loosen my grip. I leaned in, kissing her deeply, as I used my other hand to tug the nightie up and off of her. I had to let go of her neck to get the nightie over her head, and she took that chance to try to get loose. I caught her again though, pushing her roughly back into the wall, and she growled and thrashed as I tugged at the knot that held my tunic closed.

The tunic dropped to the floor and I let go of her neck, instead picking her up by her waist. She pulled herself in towards me, trying to wrap her arms and legs around my torso. I carried her away from the counter and towards the bath. I shook loose of her arms and dropped her into the now full tub with a splash. She shrieked, loudly enough that I was sure the guards would come rushing in, and I turned off the cold water tap. She was gasping, huge eyes even wider, scrambling at the sides of the bath to get out of the frigid water. I pushed her back down until just her head was above the water, and I climbed in on top of her.

I did have some trouble finding just where to put myself, but in my defence the water was **very** cold. Once I did, Lady Chypia stopped trying to scramble up the side of the tub, and instead wrapped herself around me. I didn't stop until well after she made her satisfaction known, and she hadn’t been quiet about it either. It wasn’t until I started to really start to feel the effects of the cold that I finally picked her up out of the bath. She was shivering uncontrollably, and I sat her back down on the counter. Unlike last time it was all she could do to wrap her arms around herself. I took my time as I dried off first, leaving her there wet and shivering on the counter. I grabbed a fresh towel, and bundled her up in it, getting her mostly dry. I picked her up in the little bundle, and carried her back into the bedroom.

I dumped her unceremoniously on the foot of the bed, before slipping in under the covers. It took her a moment, but she kicked herself free of the towel, and then crawled up to the head of the bed. She scrambled in under the covers and pressed herself to my chest, still shivering like mad. I shifted around, getting comfortable, and put an arm around her.

*I really hope she doesn’t execute me in the morning.*

-----

I woke the next morning to find Lady Chypia sitting on my chest, and she a firm grip on my hair with both hands.

“Quinn?” She asked, in a normal every day tone.

“Yes Lady Chypia?” I asked, in the same tone.

“I swear, by Verrin, if you ever do that again,” she started, her voice suddenly harsh and angry.

*Whoops*

“You had better wait at least a week,” she finished.

I laughed, “I’m just glad Enes didn’t come in, ready to cut my head off. She must have heard the sound you made when I dropped you into the tub.”

She sighed, and slipped back down under the covers. I rolled onto my side and pulled her back against my chest.

“The whole manor probably would have heard me, but my rooms are soundproofed magically. It was quite expensive, but worth it,” she said, a little duskily, as she settled against me, “I’ve got an image to maintain, I can’t have the whole manor hearing me moan like a whore when I’m being entertained by a gentleman caller.”

*I’ll file that information away for later. The sound proofing, not the moaning like a whore part. That one was obvious on the first night.*

“If you have any other… inventive, ideas, do let me know. Unless… me knowing makes it less fun,” she said in her dusky voice, as she rubbed her tailbone against my hips.

*I bet I can cross off problem two right here.*

“I do have one in mind, I’ll need to gather some materials though,” I teased.

“Oh? What kind of materials?” She asked, clearly interested.

“Hmm, seven or eight feet of silk cloth, some rope, and two wooden rods each three or four feet long. And I’ll need somewhere sturdy to hang it from.”

“Should I be worried?” A little confusion sneaking into her voice.

“No, I think you’ll enjoy it. Though there will be a lot less screaming on your part.”

# Chapter 22

Quinn

-----

Lady Chypia seemed eager to test the limits of my endurance, and didn’t let me out of bed until nearly lunchtime. I managed to talk my way free of her grip only by reiterating my promise for a surprise the following evening. Once I did get loose I found that I’d been granted a little more freedom. No longer would I be required to take Enes or Aris with me when I left the manor. This was less freedom than it sounded like though. Sure, this definitely gave me the chance to do a little recon without Chypia knowing just what I was looking into, but on the other hand I still wasn’t going to be able to leave the city. I might have an easier time buying tools or materials for my escape, but on the other hand, I didn’t really have a place to hide them now that I was playing bed warmer for Lady Chypia. I took what advantage I could though, and spent some time walking around the city, looking for some alternative to rushing one of the gates. It didn’t help that aside from Lady Chypia and her servants, I knew no one in the city. I didn’t even know where to start if I wanted to try to get in contact with either the criminal underworld of the city, or some sort of rebellious faction. The cuffs didn’t help, they marked me as property to anyone that saw me, and the tunic was short sleeved. I wasn’t going to be able to hide them without the deception being conspicuous.

*Side objective one: Get my coat back*

It was definitely odd, compared to Adympian clothing, but the oddity was not in the way that it could hide the cuffs. Hopefully it could distract from the rest of my planned deception.

Lady Chypia had returned my knife and multitool when I started to assemble my little workshop, which left only my jacket to recover. It was long enough to cover the cuffs, so if I couldn’t get them off before escaping I could at least just wear the jacket. It wasn’t ideal, but I’d rather get the hell gone than waste time trying to figure out how to cut through them.

*I need to ask Lady Chypia about Enutur and his big stupid boat. If some of my things are kicking around the city it might be nice to take them with me when I leave.*

I did a full circuit of the city, staying a street or so back from the city wall. I didn’t want to make it look like I was casing the joint after all. I was disappointed by what I found, or rather, by what I didn’t find. No big crumbling sections, no conveniently climbable trees overhanging one side of the wall, and nowhere did it seem low enough to risk jumping from the top. In fact, if there was a tree tall enough to overhang the wall then it would be fifty or sixty feet tall. It looked like the city walls were as much designed to keep people in, as they were designed to keep them out. I finished my circuit, ending up on the far side of the harbour from where I started.

*Well, this might work…*

I looked down the length of the sea wall that jutted out into the harbour. I could see the tiny figures of the city guard patrolling the wall near the opening to the sea, and it seemed rather light, at least compared to the heavy presence at the city gates. The trouble would be finding a boat to steal. I might be able to swim the distance, but it seemed like a really good way to get myself killed. The tide was coming in as I watched and while most of the harbour was fairly calm, it was a harbour after all, the area just along the sea wall was very rough. Waves crashed against the base of the wall, and if I got too close I’d be slammed against the massive stone blocks. I didn’t really want to swim down the middle of the harbour either, since such a large volume of water flowing through the small gap in the sea wall was sure to create all sorts of dangerous currents. Swimming would also mean getting everything I carried with me wet, probably ruining any food I brought along, unless I could figure out some sort of waterproof container.

*Because the last two times I took a swim went so well.*

I walked the length of the waterfront, looking for boats that seemed ripe for the picking, and mentally reviewing my various options for air gun valves. On the one hand, I did come up with a design that should work well, on the other hand, I found that stealing a boat was not really going to be an option. The Adympians weren’t stupid, they recognized the harbour for the massive escape route that it was, and took steps to counter this weakness. I’d have to check, but it was very likely that there was some sort of city ordinance in place covering the proper storage of watercraft. I wasn’t about to find a boat sitting on a sand bank, turned belly up, and held in place only by a short chain and a cheap lock.

Swimming would be risky as hell, but stealing a boat might be worse. I didn’t want my escape plans held up by my fumbling around, looking for a building to break into, if shit hit the fan and I needed to leave on zero warning. Swimming carried a big risk, but it was a risk I could plan for accurately. Breaking in and stealing a boat would be hard to plan for, and I’d probably be dodging whatever night time guard patrols existed while I did it.

*Hell, I might steal the boat, only to be caught as I dragged it across the street and into the sea.*

It brought me closer to solving problem number five at least.

-----

I got waterproofing sorted out surprisingly quickly, once I realized that the solution to sleeping on the road should also keep my things dry while in the water. Assuming of course, that I did end up swimming. The hammock itself would be a double or triple layer silk sheet, but I needed a tarp to string over it to keep the rain off. Contemporary tents were apparently made of either oilskin, or waxed leather, so this worked out quite well. I paid for a sheet of oilskin, large enough to provide cover for the hammock as I slept in it. Additionally, I could use that same tarp to wrap up all of my gear before taking the plunge.

This still left me swimming to freedom though, which was not an ideal solution. Would it be unexpected? Certainly. But that was probably because it was a stupid idea. I’d have some advantage since neither wood nor city elves seemed to have anything like human endurance, but that just meant that the swim would be incredibly dangerous instead of suicidal.

-----

Once I got back to the manor it only took a short time to get the hammock finished. Using a solid sheet was far quicker than hand-knotting what was basically a giant net, and I was done a little before dinner. I quickly sketched out my valve design so I wouldn’t forget it, then dropped off the hammock in our room before washing up for dinner with Lady Chypia.

“I’m surprised that you were so bold as to try your little trick with the bath, last night,” she was saying, as we were finishing our dinner.

“Well maybe I was feeling a little rebellious. That’s the sort of thing you keep me around for, isn’t it?” I said, trying to not to seem too sure of myself.

“Mmm,” she smiled, pursing her lips, “That was awfully cruel of you. Maybe I need to have you make it up to me.”

“Oh, and just how would I do that?” I asked, leaning back in my chair.

“Maybe I’ll have you kneel at my feet during breakfast from now on, and if I enjoy your performance, maybe I’ll let you eat out of my hand,” she said, with a predatory smile.

I raised my eyebrows, “Are you sure? I might make it hard for you to concentrate on your food.”

“Oh I’ll find some way to pay you back, I think I’ll make it a surprise. After all, turnabout is fair play,” she said, as she stood, and walked around the table towards me.

*Uh oh. Watch your ass Quinn, maybe literally.*

She lifted my chin with one finger, though we were already basically at eyelevel, despite the fact that I was sitting “Now, are you going to show me your little surprise or not? And be warned, if it’s anything like last night, know that the retribution will be even more substantial. Though that’s not to say I don’t want to see your little surprise.”

-----

Lady Chypia sat on the bed, watching with interest and confusion as I hung the hammock. It had taken some effort to find something sturdy enough to hold the weight, but thankfully the canopied bed was solidly built, and I strung the hammock diagonally across the bed.

“I’m still not quite sure what this is meant to do,” she said, giving me a look.

“Come here,” I said, snatching her up, and she gave a little yelp.

I’d hung the hammock as high as it could go, I wasn’t sure how Lady Chypia felt about heights, but anything to keep her off balance would do.

I deposited her in the hammock, before climbing in myself.

“Careful! Careful!” she exclaimed, when the hammock twisted as I was getting in.

It seemed that she wasn’t very fond of heights after all, and she clung rigidly to me as the hammock settled.

*And I thought that this would be less interesting than the other night. Oh, I am going to scare the hell out of her.*

“Do you not like heights m’Lady?” I asked innocently, looking down at where she was flattened against my chest, trying to stay as low as possible.

“I’m four and a half feet tall,” she said, with quick, clipped words, “How would **you** like the idea of sleeping perched on the edge of the roof?”

Absently I started rocking back and forth. The truth was, I was pretty afraid of heights, but the hammock wasn’t much more than six feet from the floor right now.

“Quinn….” She said warningly.

“Oh m’Lady, you’re insatiable. Fine, if you insist,” I said, and I grabbed her by the waist.

I sat her up on top of me, pulling her nightie up and over her head. She yelped again, trying to press herself back down, but I caught her by the shoulders and held her upright. Sitting up only gave her a better view of just how high up she was, and it probably didn’t help that we were rocking back and forth quite a bit by now.

“Yeep! You stoppit!” she said, beating her tiny fists against my chest.

*Just once, I’d like to have a healthy physical and emotional relationship with someone, where the whole thing wasn’t fucked up in any way. Still zero for three.*

I let her back down, and I shifted so she could lay beside me instead of on top of me. She settled down after a while, and once she did relax, she demanded my attention. It wasn’t quite as animated as the last couple of times, but I enjoyed the way that she’d squeak whenever the hammock shifted too much as we moved around.

-----

Lady Chypia nearly dumped the two of us out of the hammock the following morning, I think she’d forgotten just where she was sleeping, and I woke with a start as I felt the hammock tip dramatically. I grabbed her, pulling her to my chest, before she could roll out of the hammock and fall to the floor. She went from bleary eyed sleepiness, to wide awake in an instant, and it felt like she was trying to push herself into me. I rubbed her shoulders and made soothing sounds, it took a moment, but she relaxed.

“Humans must all be mad,” she said, a little breathlessly, “You’d think that with so few years available, you’d be more careful with the years you do have.”

“I’m plenty careful, a hammock isn’t *that* dangerous.”

“What about when we first met? With your hands tied, you swam from a ship at sea, all the way to the coast. I should have known then that humans were crazy.”

“Well I was very strongly motivated, and if I hadn’t done that then I’d never have met you,” I said, kissing the top of her head, “What ever happened to Enutur anyway?”

“The captain of that mail carrier? He left the same night you arrived. That was probably smart of him, the Alkides family would have held him responsible for the damage to their ship and the death of its captain.”

“Oh, so I did end up killing him then?” I asked, not quite sure if I should feel guilty or satisfied.

“Yes, the damn fool’s armour dragged him down, I don’t think they managed to retrieve the body either. He’ll still be at the bottom of the sea somewhere.”

“And they’d hold Enutur, and not me, responsible for that?” I asked, somewhat confused.

“Well, I might have neglected to mention just how I acquired you. I’m sure that some of the soldiers that saw you might recognize you, but that’s only four or five people that even know of the connection. If they saw you, and if they cared to make a fuss, it wouldn’t be hard for me to discredit them. Or I could just bribe them, and then as far as they knew, you’d be at the bottom of the sea, just like the captain.”

“How did Enutur get away? It was some distance off, but the ship looked like it was in pretty rough shape,” I asked, remembering the damage to the flank of the ship, where the Adympian trireme had gone nose-in.

“I’m guessing that all of the damage was above the waterline,” she said, as she shifted around on top of me to get more comfortable, “because I haven’t heard about any shipwrecks since he left.”

“Damn, the bastard still has all of my things then. I guess he didn’t try to sell any of it before he left?”

“No, feeling a little homesick? Looking for a memento?” she asked, genuinely seeming to care.

I sighed, “Not really though something like the body of the Maglite would have made a good reservoir for the air gun. Actually, do you still have my coat somewhere?”

“Yes, why?” She asked.

The coat, being an article of clothing, was definitely a powerful reminder of home. A reminder of not being a slave, this was the same reason she’d given me Adympian clothing since day one. My jeans and t-shirt had not been returned either, hell, I hadn’t even gotten my underwear back.

“Well I can probably cut it apart, the same thing that makes the fabric waterproof should also make it airtight. You remember the leather air bladder I’m trying to get working? If I made a bladder out of the material of my coat then I bet that would solve most of the problems I’m having.”

*There you go Lady Chypia, let me tear up the one reminder of home, and render it into a shape to serve you.*

“Mmm, well it’s in the trunk over there,” she said, nodding towards one wall, where a small chest sat next to an armoire.

I made an appreciative sound, and we talked for a little while longer, before she finally demanded I carry her to the bath.

-----

I checked the chest she’d pointed out to me after breakfast, and found not only my coat, but the rest of my clothes piled inside. Everything had been washed and folded after my swim, and I took the coat out, leaving the rest of my things.

*Side quest one, complete.*

I’d be able to get to them later, so there was no sense in rushing. I needed a second set of clothes after all, to change into once I finished my swim, and they would do very nicely.

-----

The next few days passed rather uneventfully, with everything becoming rather routine. I’d bathe with Lady Chypia in the morning, which always took about twice as long as it should have. We’d have breakfast together, and then I’d go off to work on the air gun or my escape preparations in my workshop. We’d have lunch together, and then I’d be off to the library for the afternoon. Erilon and Cusole handled most of the day to day work, but there was still some minor bookkeeping for me to handle, and the two of them would brief me on how Lady Chypia’s business was going. I was meant to be her steward, as well as her bed warmer, which meant that I needed to be properly acquainted with her affairs. I’d be making management decisions after all, assuming I stuck around, so most of the time in the afternoon was spent getting up to speed. Come evening I’d have some free time before dinner, and I’d read whatever book caught my interest. I’d been looking specifically for books on herbology, and while Lady Chypia did have a few, none were particularly detailed. I was hoping for some mystical and magical equivalent to penicillin, but I had no such luck.

I did find references to Alchemy though, which I found very interesting. According to what little I’d found on the topic, it was a sort of magic that nearly anyone could learn, thought it was said to be even more difficult to use than the innate magic used by Mages or Wizards.

*Is that healing salve Lady Chypia has an alchemical creation?*

Finally I’d have dinner with Lady Chypia, and she’d drag me to bed immediately after. I held off trying anything else adventurous, I was well aware that I was still due some retribution, and our activities were decidedly more vanilla. Though with Lady Chypia even vanilla still seemed to involve a lot of biting and scratching on her part.

As time wore on I started to feel things changing between us, at least from my perspective. I felt her grip on me loosening, and it loosened just a little bit more every night. I’d been a little starved for physical attention before landing in this new world, though that was mostly my own fault, and since arriving here I’d been far too eager to change that. It’s the eagerness, I’d realized, that had made my relationships over the past six months more than a little messed up. It was especially clear to me, now that I was here in Ventia with Chypia. By all rights I should be perfectly satisfied, after all, wasn’t I getting exactly what I’d wanted? A sixteen year old Quinn would been absolutely ecstatic, “To hell with Nimre,” he would have said. But as time wore on, and I accumulated more scratches and bites from Chypia, I realized just how empty it all was. How empty it still was, and the more I became aware of that, the more I was free of Chypia’s influence. I still acted the part, but now it was truly an act, and no longer did I feel as if the act was for myself instead of Chypia.

-----

I was ready to leave, at least in theory, about a week after I finished the hammock. I’d come up with solutions to the rest of my problems, and even gotten the airgun working.

Problem one had been food, and that had been solved easily enough. I’d been thinking about trying to make pemmican, or maybe hard tack, but I didn’t really need that much food. It didn’t need to keep that long either, so I settled for raw fruits and vegetables. I could pick them up on the last day, and stash them with the rest of my escape kit for that night. The fruit would keep for a couple days, and the vegetables for a couple more, and they were relatively calorie dense so didn’t take up a lot of space.

Problem two had been sleeping accommodations, which was obviously solved with the hammock and oilskin tarp. The tarp also doubled as a waterproof container when I wrapped it up tight, using the ties normally meant to hang it from trees, to keep it closed. My food, money, spare clothing, multitool, and knife, would go in there.

Problem three had been the money. I’d accounted for eighteen days of travel, with me arriving in Nimre on noon of the eighteenth day. Five or six of those days would be in Adympia which meant staying away from inns, so that meant roughly thirteen days’ worth of funds to pay for room and board. I’d aimed for twenty six drachm, which should keep me covered even if it was more expensive here than in Rhona. I’d been luckier than that though, and had managed to embezzle fifty drachm from my assassination budget.

Problem four had been to remove the cuffs, and I’d thought that I had a brilliant solution to this problem. I was rather wrong. I’d broken into one of the abandoned mills that I’d seen during my walk with Chypia the week before, thinking that if a file wouldn’t get through the cuffs, then I could use what was basically a massive water powered grinding wheel. This was not the case, and while I’d evaded detection as I broke in, the millstone was designed for grain, not metal. All it had done was scratch the finish a little, which had taken me some time in my workshop to cover up. Hopefully my jacket would cover them from view if I ran into anyone on my way out of Adympia, and once I was beyond the border, hopefully no one would care. I might even get a little help, depending on how the Ashurians felt about runaway slaves.

Problem five would be solved by swimming, which I still thought was a terrible idea. I’d made a long leather bladder, and passed it off as a test for the air gun. In fact, it would be my flotation device. I’d tie the tarp and the things inside to what was basically a big inflatable pontoon, and I’d use it to help me stay afloat and away from the seawall as I swam to freedom. I’d been keeping track of the tides over the past week, and would leave just when the tide was at its highest. It wouldn’t really be flowing in or out which should make the swim more manageable, and if I did end up taking too long, the tide would at least help carry me out. I did hope to be clear of the harbour well before then though.

The airgun I’d made a few canisters for, and the valve I’d created seemed to work well. Inside the canister was a little metal disc, larger than the opening that would feed the air through the barrel. When pressurized the disc would be pressed against the opening, sealing the canister. All you’d need to do to fire the airgun would be to press the canister into the little nub on the end of the barrel. I’d refined this when I built it into the cane. All you’d need to do is hold the cane firmly in both hands, point at the target, and push down on the top of the cane. It acted as a plunger, which would force the canister over the barrel. The seal was good, and the canister drained very quickly. Enes and Chypia were pleased when I’d shown them how it was used, it had put a wooden needle right through a stiff piece of cloth, and into a pork leg being used as a target. I’d switched to a wooden needle in the hope that it might just be confused for a nasty splinter. Nusalvo would find the needle whether it was bronze or wood, but bronze at least would raise some questions. The wooden needle also made it easier to deliver the poison, as it could be allowed to seep into and coat the wood. I’d leave Chypia with five canisters and five more of the treated needles.

I’d been worried about carrying my many things down to the harbour in the middle of the night, but thankfully the cloth merchants had solved that problem for me. Their little ‘factory’ was very near the waterfront, and Chypia had involved me in the business once the planned acquisition went ahead. I’d found an unused chest, stuck a lock on it, and told the underpaid and overworked manager that it was full of Chypia’s things. He didn’t argue, and wasn’t likely to talk to Chypia directly. Over the next few days I’d dropped my things off inside, and they were none the wiser. The only thing not waiting for me in that chest would be my Earth clothing, since of all my things they were the most likely to be noticed missing.

I was ready to go, the only question was, “When?” I didn’t want Chypia waking up in the middle of the night to find me missing. Hell, just getting out of her grip without waking her would be an ordeal in and of itself.

-----

We had dinner in her room that night, which should have tipped me off that there was something suspicious going on, but unfortunately I didn’t notice until it was too late. It was a very nice dinner, cooked salmon, assorted greens, and white wine. I’d never been very fond of drink and had been leaving the wine mostly untouched. Chypia had been prodding me to enjoy it, which also should have raised my suspicion, so to satisfy her I finished the wine in a few short gulps once I was done with the fish. Chypia smiled like a shark the moment I put the wineglass down, and it was only then that I realized my mistake.

My vision swam, and I slumped out of the chair and onto the floor, unconscious.

-----

I woke, to find myself tied to the bed, naked.

*I guess turnabout is fair play, but I really have places to be.*

I could hear Chypia moving about the room, but the curtains on the canopied bed had been lowered, so I couldn’t see quite what she was doing. She must have heard the mattress shift, because she pulled apart the curtains at the foot of the bed to look at me lying there. She was naked, sweaty, and her hair was a mess. Heaving me onto the bed must have taken quite a bit of effort on her part.

“Well, don’t you seem excited,” she said, with a wry expression on her face as she looked at me.

“Maybe once I’ve spent some time on my new throne,” she said, patting my cheek, “We’ll see if you’ve earned some of my attention. I hope you can hold your breath for a long while, I might take some time to get comfortable on my new seat. I’ll leave you to think about that while I get cleaned up.”

I groaned as she closed the curtains and walked to the bathroom. I heard the taps turn on, and the tub start to fill with water. She always liked taking her time in the bath. It took me quite a while to calm down so I could think straight, I might have been slightly worked up. Once I did calm myself though I realized that I probably could still leave tonight. In fact, I could even get myself a pretty substantial headstart.

I cast Apportation, and freed myself in short order. I was very quiet as I moved around, I didn’t want her to realized that I’d freed myself, and I located both sets of my clothing. The Earth set was still in that trunk, and my Adympian clothes were scattered near where I’d passed out. I was slightly alarmed by what I found at the foot of the bed though. She had quite the collection of implements, none seemed like they’d be particularly painful, but they definitely catered to Chypia’s brand of torture.

*I only wish I had time to try half this stuff on her, but I’ve got places to be.*

I picked up a few choice pieces though, and pressed myself against the wall, next to the door. When it opened I’d be concealed behind it, and hopefully I’d be able to catch Chypia unawares as she walked towards the bed. She took her sweet time in the bath, and I had to check my watch to make sure that I wasn’t going to overrun my timetable by having my fun. It turned out I was fine, I’d only been unconscious for half an hour or so, and we’d had dinner early. I had hours until I need to be on my way. Chypia spent one of those hours in the bath, she was really taking her time with this, I was a little impressed. Eventually though I heard her rise, and the tub start to drain. There was a rustling as she dried herself off, and then the door opened. She walked slowly towards the bed, hips swaying as she did.

“Oh Quinnnnnnn,” she said in a sing song voice.

“Yes m’Lady?” I asked from right behind her.

I caught her before she could say anything, pulling her arms behind her back and clamping a hand over her mouth. She struggled, but I managed to get her own cuffs around her wrists, binding her arms behind her back. She kicked her legs at me, but I managed to get a second pair of cuffs around those as well. I stood over her, rather appreciating the look of her wriggling around on the floor.

“No fair!” she said, “Do you know how much work it was to find everything?”

“Well, don’t worry, you’ll still get to enjoy some of it,” I said smugly, as I picked her up, carrying her towards the bed.

“I’m still going to pay you back for this. Especially now!” She said, trying to seem angry, though the effect was rather ruined by the humour that crept into her voice.

I took the silk ropes she’d used to bind my feet to the bedposts, and used those to tie her into position at the end of the bed. She was left kneeling over the end of the bed, and unable to move from her **very** exposed position.

“If you ever tell anyone about this,” she said, trying to turn to look at me, “I swear I will lock you in a closet and only let you out when I want somewhere interesting to sit.”

“Oh don’t worry,” I said, as I checked the knots, “This is just between us. This is why you keep me around after all, isn’t it?”

“Maybe, but you had better make this worth it,” she said, starting threatening, but ending with her dusky voice.

“Oh trust me, I will, now open up,” I instructed.

She narrowed her eyes at me, but obliged, and I slipped a gag into her mouth. The next thing on was a silk blindfold, and she was reduced to muffled moaning. I looked at my watch, and then at the little collection she’d laid out at the end of the bed.

*Damn, there’s quite the collection here, I only wish I had the time.*

I felt both guilty and extraordinarily pleased with the thought of Aris or Pasa coming in to check on her, only to find her in her current state. Then I started laughing manically, *oh yes Quinn, that idea is even better.*

“Now it’s my turn to leave you waiting,” I said to her, still giggling to myself, as I went to have a quick bath.

I didn’t take long, I was going to end up in the harbour shortly anyway. I dried and dressed hurriedly, wearing the Adympian clothes. Chypia was still there, still tied up on the end of the bed, and I leaned in beside her ear to speak. It would be best to keep the charade going as long as possible.

“I’m going to go down to my workshop to get something I’ve been preparing especially for you,” I said, and this illicited a frustrated, yet pleased, moan, “Now don’t you go anywhere, I’ll be back, eventually.”

Instead, I went to find Aris and Pasa.

-----

I found the little room where they slept now that I was ‘serving’ Chypia, and tapped lightly on the door. I heard a stirring in the room, and tapped lightly on the door again. There was a flurry of movement, and the door was pulled open to reveal the two of them standing there primly, despite their sleepy faces and mussed hair.

“Yes Quinn?” they said at the same time, “What do you need?”

“It’s not actually what I need,” I said, very seriously, “Lady Chypia has a task for you.”

They seemed to perk up at this, and Pasa asked, “Anything for our Lady, what is it?”

“Our Lady requires the attention of both of you come six o’ clock. I think that it will be made rather more clear once you go into our bedroom, but she’ll be waiting for you,” I explained, and I had to try **very** hard not to burst into laughter.

“Oh? What does she want us to do for her?” Aris asked.

“It’s not what you’re meant to do for her, it’s what you’re going to do **to** her. Do you understand me?” I asked seriously.

They both took a moment, but I saw the look in their eyes as they understood.

“From what she’s told me, she doesn’t have you do this sort of thing often, does she?”

“No, never,” Pasa said, with a grin from ear to ear.

“This is going to be so much fun,” Aris said, almost jumping up and down.

“Now there are some rules, and you **must** follow them. Lady Chypia has gone to a lot of effort to set this up understand? And my part in it was quite an exercise, you can’t go and ruin all the work put into this, understood?”

They both nodded very seriously, though I saw the heat in their eyes, “What are the rules Quinn?” Pasa asked.

“First, you’re not allowed to untie her, no matter how much she struggles, or how much noise she makes”

“Untie her? Oh-ho-ho-ho-ho,” Aris said, they both looked absolutely ecstatic, “What else? What else?”

“Second, you can’t ungag her, or remove the blindfold either. Same rules, no matter what, understand?” They nodded, big stupid grins plastered across their faces, and I continued, “Third, you have to use every single toy she has laid out. It will be clear once you see her room, but she’s got quite the collection, and you need to use them all.”

They were hugging each other now, listening eagerly as I went on, “Finally, you don’t stop until noon. So from six o’clock in the morning, until noon, understand? And you can’t let her get bored, so don’t be afraid to try different… areas.”

“Different areas?” Aris asked innocently, though Pasa had an evil grin.

“Oh I think Pasa knows what Lady Chypia wants, or rather where she wants it, but I’ve left one of her toys in place if you need a hint.”

“This is going to be so much fun!” Pasa said, clearly already thinking of all the trouble she could get up to.

“Just remember,” I said, bending down to eye level, “This is serious. Lady Chypia said that she was only doing this to let you two both know how much she trusts you both. So make sure you follow all of the rules. I’ve got to go back up there, she’s not done with me yet, but come six o’clock it’s your turn to take over. I’ll make sure to get out of your way ahead of time, you’ll have her all to yourself.”

“Thank you thank you thank you Quinn,” they chorused, lurching forwards to wrap their arms around me.

*Man, the stuff I come up with.*

“We’ll make sure to follow every rule exactly,” Aris said, and Pasa nodded along with her.

“Well,” I hedged, “Every rule except stopping at noon. That one’s more of a minimum requirement.”

“Minimum requirement?” Aris asked.

“She doesn’t want you to stop before noon,” I explained, “But that doesn’t mean you need to stop **at** noon. If you think you can keep her entertained you can keep going until I’m back for dinner.”

“Yes!” Pasa said.

“This is going to be great!” Aris said.

“Now, you two get some sleep. Our Lady will need you two to be good and rested if you’re going to attend to her tomorrow.”

“Yes Quinn! Thank you Quinn!” They chorused, before hurrying back into their room.

*It’s too bad I won’t be here to see it.*

-----

I hurried out of the manor, sneaking out through the window of a disused room, and headed for the clothier’s factory. I stopped my sneaking once I was clear of the manor’s grounds, standing tall. No one outside of the manor would know that I wasn’t meant to be out, and sneaking would only draw suspicion. I walked confidently, just as if I was on a late night errand for my Lady, and walked right past a guard patrol on my way to the factory. The chest was sitting right where I’d left it, and was still locked tight. I opened it to find my things waiting for me, and stowed my Earth clothes before wrapping the bundle back up. I hurried down to the waterfront, along the wall.

I checked the illuminated face of my watch, I was right on time. I had my little leather pontoon inflated quickly, and eased myself quietly down from a dock and into the water. It was both fairly warm, and quite clean. Thankfully the city didn’t make a habit of dumping their trash and sewage into the bay. I settled the pontoon under my arms, and made sure that the oilskin bundle wasn’t about to break loose. Once I was happy with my preparations, I pushed off, to Nimre, and to freedom.

I used the rough stones of the wall to pull myself along while I kicked with my legs, and I made good time to the opening of the sea wall. I realized that I’d made an error once I got to the opening though, I may have been a little hasty leaving so quickly. The harbour had been shaded, and the water was almost pitch black. Unfortunately for me, the water outside the harbour shone like a sheet of stars. The sky was absolutely clear, and the full moon cast it’s light down on the sea. I was committed though, and just hoped that no one would think to look down along the bottom of the wall where it met the sea.

*Don’t worry Quinn, it’s not like elf eyesight is far better than human eyesight or anything.*

I managed to get to shore without a cry going up though, and I pulled myself quietly out of the water. I stuck close to the edge of the beach, where the sand met a sort of embankment before rising to meet the road that ran along the coast. The embankment shielded me from the view of anyone watching from the gate, and hopefully the odd shapes and shadows cast by the moonlight would break up my outline and make it hard for anyone on the sea wall to pick me out. I settled into a light jog, hunched over just a little to keep my head below the embankment, and headed for the border.

I pulled myself up the embankment once I’d gotten a kilometre or two down the beach. I was still in sight of the city, especially if elven eyesight was as good as I thought, but there was a bit of tree cover here. My immediate goal was to find a place to sleep. According to my watch it wasn’t quite midnight yet, and I wanted to get some sleep as soon as possible. I had at least a six hour head start, assuming Aris and Pasa recognized the trick immediately. If I ran now and slept later I’d probably still be asleep when whoever was chasing me would catch me. Sleeping now would mean being closer to the city once they set out, but at least I’d be rested and already on the move. Hopefully though, I’d have another six hours on top of that, maybe more.

As long as I got those extra six hours I should be okay. It wasn’t a great head start, especially since my pursuers would likely be on horseback, but horses had their own problems. I’d accounted for sixty miles per day when I was planning my trip back in Essens, and while that would be reduced a bit as I stayed off the roads, it was a pretty good pace. I knew almost nothing about horses, so I guessed that they’d be able to do eighty miles a day when I was planning my escape, with their pace also slowed by needing to track me. Without the extra six hours I estimated that they’d catch up with me near noon on the last day I’d spend in Adympia. With the head start, I’d be within an hour or two of the border when they caught up. The question then would be how precisely they could track me. If I was lucky they might ‘catch up’, only to never spot me. Of course, there was no way I’d be that lucky.

I paused, as I was stringing up the hammock, to look down at the cuffs I was still wearing. ‘Abjuration’ had been what Detect Magic had called the class of enchantment used on the cuffs, but the closest thing to a definition I had for that had come out of the Dungeon Master’s Guide. It was clear that they were far tougher than they should be, but what other enchantments might they carry?

*With my luck? A tracking enchantment. It’s what I’d do.*

If I was right, that would mean my pursuers would be right on top of me when they finally did catch up. No cat and mouse, no clever sneaking past through the underbrush. A human might be able to outpace a horse over long distances, but a horse was going to be a hell of a lot faster in the short term. If they caught up early that day I’d be screwed, the horses would be fresh from a long rest, and there’d be no way to get clear. If they caught up late though? Well then I’d have a chance, they’d be tired from nearly a full day of hard riding. I probably still wouldn’t be able to outrun them, but it would make outmanoeuvring them a lot easier.

I stripped out of my wet clothes, and changed into my Earth clothes to sleep. I’d gone some distance inland, well away from the road, in some light forests. It was still not quite as much cover as I would have liked, but I wasn’t likely to find anything very much better than this. I hung my wet clothes over some branches to dry, I’d be changing back into them for the journey tomorrow, and pulled myself up into the hammock. I laid my jacket across myself, though it was a warm night, and did my best to fall asleep.

It did take me a little while to relax, and I found myself thinking back to the way that I’d arranged my head start. At the time I’d thought it absolutely hilarious, and it was one hell of a way to knock Chypia down a few pegs. But once I had time to stop and think, I started to see what I’d done in a new light. Chypia seemed to enjoy our little struggles for control, at least within the boundaries of her bedroom, but this was different. Fooling around in the tub, or scaring her when I’d first made the hammock was one thing, this was different. Chypia at least had played along a little, but she’d likely thought of it as more of the same. She had no idea that I’d planned for her to be tied up for another twelve hours. Would she be okay with that? Definitely not. If that’s all I’d arranged for, then I wouldn’t have had a second thought. But I didn’t do that. I didn’t go to Aris and Pasa, and tell them to avoid disturbing Chypia until noon. I told them to go in there and amuse themselves, at great expense to Chypia. Worse still, as far as they knew they’d be doing as she’d ordered. As far as they knew, her struggling and muffled protests would all part of the game. Was doing all this worse than killing her? Most people would forgive a slave for killing their master to escape. Hell, some would celebrate it.

*Was this worse? Maybe it was.*

-----

I managed to get to sleep eventually, and when I woke my watch reported that it was 7:00am, July-22. I’d been on this planet for two hundred and three days. I changed back into the clothes that I’d left to dry, and packed up my Earth clothes. I planned to save them for once I was clear of Adympia, they’d draw attention, but so would the garb of an Adympian steward. Besides, once I was done with Adympia, I was going to be **done** with Adympia and that included their clothes.

I took my bearings from the sun, and headed west towards the border. I stayed away from the road, but did my best to avoid traveling through forested areas, instead following the tree line. If things went well I’d have no one after me until noon, and even then they’d only be a touch faster than I. That meant getting as much of a lead as I could manage, which meant sticking to ground I could cover more quickly.

Three o’clock rolled around, and I hadn’t yet been run down and dragged back in chains, which was nice. Chypia’s torment would have ended two or three hours ago, and they would have started to chase me maybe an hour after that. My head start was over, and the chase was on. I started to edge north a little, in preparation for my pursuers. It would bring me further from the roads, and into the forest. I was not terribly impressed with Adympian forests, it was much more sparse than the evergreen forests I’d been used to in Canada, but hopefully it would be enough to slow the horses down. I was careful, as I walked, to keep track of the sun’s position in the sky. It’s easier that you think to get lost in a forest, and I didn’t want to end up walking in circles, waiting for whoever Chypia sent to catch me.

I didn’t stop that night until the sun was well and truly below the horizon. Everything I knew about horses came from fantasy novels, but I hoped that they’d have trouble traveling at night through rough terrain, so I pushed on as long as I could. It wasn’t until the glow from the setting sun was completely gone that I’d stopped. I had the energy to keep going, but the last thing I wanted to do was get lost in a forest at night. Instead I found a place to hang my hammock for the night, and planned for the inevitable confrontation.

My resources were fairly limited. I had my knife and the multitool, my watch, all four of my rings, my pen, and one waterproof jacket. But I also had magic, though admittedly, not a whole hell of a lot of it. Using magic would also mean that surrender was not an option, though my little stunt with Chypia had probably already seen to that. She was not going to be pleased with me if she caught me. I had the mana stones set into the ring, I’d found out early on that they recharged themselves in about a day, which did give me an extra 4 mana. That did mean that Ignite was a possibility, I could dump in three mana and try to catch someone in the face with it, though it would be tricky. Apportation was the other spell of note if it came to a fight. Throwing rocks wasn’t a terribly good use for the spell, but that wasn’t all I could do. I knew from my very extensive testing with Thera’s aid that I could create long, thick, and flexible… rods. They were rods. It was a strange thought, blocking a sword or a spear with a magical sex toy, but it would work. Just like I could bat away a weapon with my hand, I could do it with Apportation. The difference was that the manipulators couldn’t be hurt, though the force I could apply was reduced. It wasn’t perfect, it seemed that other people could ‘resist’ my interference if they didn’t make a conscious decision to consent, but I’d been able to overcome the resistance put up by both Thera and Sila when they’d helped in testing the spell. Basic Illusion and Sound were the other two spells I could get a use out of, and the other contender for mana stone use. Basic Illusion could hide me, though if I was right and the bracers held a tracking enchantment that might not matter, and Sound could distract them.

*I would kill for a wand of Magic Missile right now.*

-----

I pressed on over the next three days, getting up early, and pushing hard all day, not stopping until the sun was well below the horizon. It was spring here in Adympia, which meant I was traveling about twelve hours a day. It was hard going, but it was about what I’d planned for anyways, all those months ago in Essens. I realized, as I woken on what would be my last day in Adympia, that Thera would have arrived in Nimre by now.

*It’s a good thing we took different ships. If what Chypia said is true then Thera’s probably fine, but if I’d been there and the captain was the unscrupulous sort then they might have handed over* ***all*** *of their passengers.*

I yawned as I sat up in the hammock, feeling surprisingly good. I’d been setting one hell of a pace over the past four days, but I felt damn good. Running or biking for exercise was one thing, it was a different thing altogether to do it constantly for four days straight. It was a strange feeling to describe, but along with the soreness in my limbs, I also felt a strength. That if I had to, I could keep doing this for as long as it took to reach my goal.

*Well, as long as I have food.*

I had enough for today, and the day after. Beyond that, I’d need to find a village or town. Hopefully once I reached Ashur I could continue my normal traveling strategy of inn hopping. I packed up my belongings, wrapping them back up in the oilskin, and set out on my way. I ate my meal of assorted vegetables as I walked, while I was getting rather bored of vegetarianism, at least I didn’t need to cook anything. That meant no fires to give me away, no time wasted preparing food, and no time wasted sitting down to eat.

With very little warning I felt the air grow suddenly cold, and I paused to pull my jacket out of my bundle of belongings. I looked around as I stood there, conscious of the fact that depending on how well my trick worked, my pursuers could be only a short distance away. I didn’t see any horsemen, *horsepeople?* burst out of the brush to run me through, but I did notice the trees swaying. I looked up to see the wind shaking the treetops violently. I was somewhat protected by the forest, but the driving wind was tearing leaves and small branches free to fall to the forest floor.

The closer I grew to the border the rougher the terrain got. I was out of the plains that surrounded Ventia, and moving into the hills that characterized the border territory between Adympia and Ashur. I’d know when I found the border, because there’d be a damn big river.

*Because going swimming always works so well for me*

I had planned for this though, and the leather pontoon that I’d used to float myself out of Ventia was laid across my pack so I could get at it quickly. Whoever was chasing me would probably be right on my heels as I ran for the river, and I wanted to be able to get at it quickly.  

-----

I started to get a little more tense as my watch ticked closer and closer to noon, and I stopped on a hill to try to get a look back down my trail, careful not to silhouette myself against the sky. The wind had not lessened over the past few hours, if anything it had gotten worse, and I was very aware of that as I lay peeking over the hill. I didn’t spot anyone following me, but I did see the truly massive cloud bank rolling in from the east. They were dark grey, almost black, and I could see lightning flashing through the clouds.

*Well that’s not ominous at all.*

I pushed myself up, heading down the hill, and I had to make a conscious effort to not break into a jog. Instead I paced myself, I was going to need every bit of energy I had once my pursuers caught up with me.

-----

The rain started to fall around 2pm, though ‘fall’ didn’t really describe just what was happening. The tree cover helped to some extent, but the rain was streaking sideways, and it stung my face when I made the mistake of turning to look behind me. I was glad that I’d managed to recover my jacket, hopefully the riders following me were miserable. Assuming anyone was following me. All this planning for what ‘the riders’ and ’my pursuers’ might be doing, it would be kinda underwhelming if no one was after me.

*Am I that lucky?*

-----

No. No I was not.

I could **see** the river from my perch on the hill, unfortunately I could also see three people on horseback. The two larger riders wore armour and carried long spears, the other was small, unarmoured, and wrapped in an oilskin cloak. *Chypia?* It was hard to tell, but it looked like Maybe-Chypia was looking down at something held in her hand. The group was about a kilometre away.

*That would be the tracker.*

I looked back down towards the river, it was maybe two kilometres away. I looked back, even if that was a tracker, I bet I could distract the hell out of them if they spotted a little Quinn illusion stand up and start running. I cast my spell at the bottom of the hill behind a clump of bushes. I kept it in line between myself and the riders, I didn’t want Chypia to notice that what she saw and what the tracker said didn’t make sense. I gave it a second, making sure that one of the armoured riders was watching in the bushes direction, and then had not-Quinn bolt towards the south. One of the riders raised a cry immediately, and I had not-Quinn sprint to and slide down a short depression. I ended the spell the second he was out of sight from them. I wanted to continue it on longer, Chypia would probably look down at the tracker the second she lost track of the illusion, but I could barely hold the spell together at that distance.

*Run. Now.*

I pushed myself up off the hill, and started to run. There weren’t a lot of options when it came to places to hide, and the trees were too sparse and too small to be able to give any real cover. They’d see me almost immediately once they came around the hill, not that it would make much of a difference with that tracker. I could use the illusion spell again, though apparently not at the range I wanted to, but I’d probably need to be stationary for that. And I did not want to spend much time stationary. I cast a few copies of Apportation as I ran.

I was maybe a couple hundred metres from the river when I heard thundering hooves behind me, and I threw myself sideways behind a tree. There was a crack of wood on wood, and a charging horse bowled through the space I’d just occupied. It was Enes on the back of the horse, and she fumbled to keep a hold of her spear. I scrambled up off the ground, and Enes tried to turn her horse around, though the horse was caught up on a tree. I ran behind her and to the left as she tried to turn right to face me.
I looked around as I ran, trying to locate the other riders. I did not want to get boxed in. I’d lucked out, it looked like the other armoured rider, probably Amas, had been on Enes’s right. The last rider had been a bit behind those two, and turned to chase me.

“QUINN!” Aris screamed, and her voice sounded rough, “QUINN!”

*Not Chypia then*

“PLEASE QUINN!” She screamed, though the end came out as a cough.

I looked to my right, Enes was still getting her horse turned around, but Amas was after me. She had her spear tucked under her arm, but it was reversed, the butt of the spear was facing forwards. I reached out with Apportation, pushing back hard on one of the horse’s hooves just as it was about to set its weight down on that leg. I felt the same resistance I had when testing with Sila and Thera, but it was noticeably less than it had been for those two. The horse’s weight came down, but the hoof wasn’t there, and the horse screamed as it fell forwards.

I looked to my left, Aris was gaining on me, though she wasn’t looking at me. She was distracted, looking towards the screaming horse, her already huge eyes even wider. I was close to the river now, and I could see where the ground sloped away towards the water. I glanced back towards Amas, she’d hesitated as she seemed to consider stopping for Enes, she’d been pinned by her horse and was struggling to get free.

“Go! I’ll help her, GO!” Aris shouted as she half leaped, half fell from her horse to land roughly beside Enes.

Amas caught up with me just as I reached the top of the slope. It was a hell of a lot steeper than I’d thought, and with the grass slick from the rainfall it might as well have been a sheet of ice. I heard her scream, and I turned to see her swinging the butt of her spear, directly at my head. I raised my arm to protect my face, and threw one of my manipulators in the path of the spear. It dampened the blow, but the heavy haft of wood carried through it to smash into my arm, and the very tip just barley caught me in the face. I screamed as I fell backwards, my arm felt like it was on fire, and I could feel hot blood running down into my eyes. I tumbled down the slope headfirst, and scrambled to try to right myself or slow my fall. I caught hold of a tree about half way down the slope. Well, when I say caught, what I really mean is that my back slammed into it which brought me to a halt.

“Quinn you son of a whore!” Amas screamed at me from the top of the hill, horse unable to make it down safely.

I could barely make out her features. I’d lost my glasses when she’d hit me in the face. I felt at my arm, and at my legs. Both hurt like hell, but both worked. I looked down towards the rushing water, at least I thought it was rushing, it was awfully hard to tell. It didn’t look like very much fun, but I pulled the stupid leather pontoon from where it was tied to my pack and inflated it as fast as I could. I looked back towards the top of the hill, to see Amas clambering off of her horse, while screaming incoherently at me.

*She seems unhappy with me for some reason.*

I got the pontoon inflated, and made sure I had a solid grip on it before sliding down what remained of the hill. I managed to control my descent fairly well, and while I collected some more scrapes, I didn’t smash into any more obstacles. I hit the water feet first, which of course was freezing cold, and started kicking out into the middle of it. I was carried away quickly by the fast current, and Amas’s screaming faded into the distance, covered by the rushing water and pouring rain. Even with the pontoon it was a fight to keep my head above water in the rushing river. The current would carry me downstream and fighting against that would be useless, but there was nothing stopping me from swimming across it, I focused on swimming for the far bank.

I was about half way across the river when I suddenly felt a blinding pain. In one moment I felt tired, sore, I could hear my ragged breaths, and the uncomfortable squelch of my soaked clothing. In the next moment, all of that was overwhelmed by an unimaginable pain in my forearms. It didn’t stop either, and it took a moment for me to realize where I was, and just what I should be doing. It was all I could do to keep my grip on the pontoon, and I kicked my legs, trying to get to shore. The pain was immense, and my vision was nothing but a white void. I could hear myself screaming whenever I wasn’t gasping for breath or coughing up water, and an eternity later I felt myself bump against something. My legs found the riverbed and I tried to stand, only to fall forwards again. I scrambled up the riverbank and onto dry land, feeling blindly at sand, pebbles, roots, and clumps of grass. I thrashed around in the sand and dirt beside the river, screaming and tearing uselessly at the cuffs.

It felt like it took an eternity, but eventually I got my breath. I don’t know how long I’d been there, and by the time I managed to focus it was well after sundown. The pain had not let up at all, but at least I could see straight now. I managed to get my feet under me, and I patted around weakly for my things. I was still wearing my jacket, though it and my clothes were a muddy mess, and still had the bundle, though the pontoon must have floated away. I’d managed to stop myself from screaming, but my breath was still coming out in choked gasps.

*If I cross back to the other side, these things will probably stop hurting.*

I looked to the other side of the river, shaking uncontrollably from the pain in my forearms and the cold.

*Fuck that.*

I turned slowly, looking up the slope on this side of the river, and took a ragged breath before grasping the nearest tree and hauling myself up it. It was hard going, aside from the pain I felt, my hands were also useless. I had to hook the tree with my elbow, and couldn’t really grab for roots or branches to haul myself along. I managed to get up the slope though, and I forced myself forwards. I could barely stand up straight. Every so often I’d stumble, fall, and it would take me a minute or two to decided that, yes, I needed to get up. I tried to cast Light to help me see, between the thunderstorm and the late hour I could barely make out anything more than a few feet in front of me, but I just could not concentrate on the spell.

I fell, for probably the thousandth time. It was late, my watch said that it was 1:00AM, July-27, and I had no idea where I was. No idea where I was, only one more day of food, my glasses were gone which meant that compared to an elf I was basically blind, and with these cuffs on I could barely think. It was pitch black, I was wet, and there was no way I’d be able to sleep now that I’d triggered the cuffs. I had no idea where to find even a small village, and even if I did, could they even help me? Would they even help me? A giant, driven half mad by pain and covered in mud stumbles into town, I’d be lucky not to get stabbed to death with a pitch fork.

I looked down at the cuffs, how long had it been since I crossed the river? Hours at most, and already I was considering a solution to my problems that involved my belt and a stout tree branch. I turned my hands over, no joints or seams here either. I didn’t even know how these fit together. My rings caught my eye, the stupid fucking thumb rings. I’d made them for the bow, the bow that I’d lost when Enutur had tried to sell me. I’d made it to protect myself, spent fucking hours practicing with it, useless hours. Would it have helped with any of the shit I’d been though since losing it? It was useless, these stupid rings were useless, I tore off the stupid thumb rings and threw them into the night.

*All the planning in the fucking world, and it’s made useless because one pudgy asshole wants a payday.*

I stared at the aluminum ring, the one set with the mage stone. My mage stone.

*Why are you here Quinn? Why are you here, and not in Essens, cosy in bed with Sila. Why are you here, and not in Myra, cosy in bed with Thera. Why are you here, and not in Ventia, cosy in bed with Chypia? WHY ARE YOU HERE?*

The mage stone flared to life, blinding light illuminating the forest around me like a collapsed star. I stood up, and started walking.

-----

They found me the following night, just as the sun was going down. Apparently the mage stone had been burning that whole time, and it had made it easy to find me stumbling through the growing darkness.

# Chapter 23

Quinn

-----

I woke up somewhere strange and unknown, which was getting to be a habit of mine. The fact that I was without my glasses didn’t help with the strangeness either. There were a few things that demanded my immediate attention. Firstly, I was naked, which was not great. Secondly, I wasn’t restrained, which was better. Third, and this was the big one, I couldn’t feel the cuffs any more. I was in a narrow bed, which was far too short, and the sheets felt like sandpaper. In reality they were probably just the linens that were popular with common folk here in Elardia, but I’d gotten used to a rather different level of luxury when working for Chypia.

*Can’t be too common though if they got those damn cuffs off.*

I tried to sit up in bed, and had to force down a stab of panic when I realized that not only could I not feel the cuffs, I couldn’t feel my hands. I managed to push myself upright on my elbows, and I looked down at my hands. My hands were still there, along with my rings, and the cuffs were definitely gone. I brought my hands together, trying to see if I could feel anything in my hands, but it was like two chunks of wood knocking together. No feeling in my hands, none in my wrists, it wasn’t until I got to my elbows that I could start to feel anything. I still had some basic motor control, my hands weren’t flopping around uselessly on the ends of my arms, but beyond that a slight twitch in my fingers was about all I could manage.

“If there’s a goddess of luck, she can go fuck herself,” I said quietly.

I took a look around, trying to find my clothes and the rest of my things. I could see what looked like my oilskin bundle piled in the corner, my jacket and Adympian clothes were missing though. On the nightstand were my watch, and both of the gold cuffs.

There was a creak as the door opened, and an elf shaped blur entered the room. I couldn’t make out many details beyond the very broad strokes, but he seemed slight of build and had green hair. He was a little darker, and there were two blurry green splotches where his eyes should have been.

*A wood elf then, same general look as Moss.*

“You’re awake,” said the blur, in a man’s voice, “You even seem sane.”

“Oh I don’t know about that,” I said, with a little humour, “It’s still early yet.”

I lifted my useless hands, “I see you got the cuffs of, unfortunately…” I trailed off.

He took a seat in a chair near the bed, “You don’t have much feeling in your hands, do you?” He asked, with elves it was always hard to guess at an age, but if he was human I’d have guessed that he was in his fifties.

“I don’t have any feeling in my hands, none in my forearms either. Are you about to tell me that this is only temporary?” I asked, not daring to be hopeful.

He sighed, “I’m afraid not. I’ve tended to quite a few runaways from Adympia, I’ve never known any that have recovered from the damage that the manacles do.”

“Are you a Mage? Couldn’t you use some healing magic or something?”

“I am a Mage yes, I even know some healing magic, but this is not the sort of damage that can be healed. In fact, most of the time a very extensive healing will leave the healed portions much the same as your hands are now. Anything beyond skin and muscle is always a risk, anything more complicated than that usually gets put back together improperly. It’s usually enough to keep the patient alive, but it will often leave them crippled. Trying to heal your hands would likely only make it worse. I am sorry.”

*Nerve damage.*

“It’s not your fault,” I said, leaning back against the wall, “I’m guessing that eyes fall into the same category then?”

“Yes, healing magic almost always fails when used on the eyes. They’re simply too complicated,” he said, “Ah, why do you ask? There was that gash across your face, but your eyes seemed to have escaped injury.”

I raised a hand to my face, before I remembered how futile that would be, “My eyes aren’t injured, just defective. I’ve needed glasses since I was six years old, without them I’m mostly blind.”

He straightened a little, and if I could make out his expression I might have seen a look of concern on his face, “I’ve never known anyone to have such a problem, you say that ‘glasses’ could repair your vision though, what are those?”

“A wire frame used to hold two lenses in place. The lenses correct for the problem in my eyes, allowing me to see properly. And this can’t be solved with magic either I’m guessing?” I asked.

“Well, potentially anything is possible with magic, but I don’t know that any spells or enchantments exist for what you seem to need. You’d have to find a Mage or Wizard willing to do the work for you, and even then it might take years or decades for them to design a workable solution.”

“Dammit,” I said, clenching my fists in anger. Or, I tried to. My fingers just twitched impotently.

*So I’m down two of five senses, I wonder how I’ll lose the other three?*

“How hard is it for a Mage to get into the university at Nimre?” I asked.

“Hmm, not hard, wh- Oh yes. That ring holds a mage stone doesn’t it? That would explain the lights that the border patrol saw,” He said, I think he nodded towards my hand, it was hard to tell.

It flared to life with barely a second thought on my part, and he shaded his eyes, “Yes it is,” I said.

“My my, I don’t think you’ll have much trouble getting in at all,” he said, and I let the light fade, “It’s always hard to tell with just the mage stone, but you’re probably somewhere between the fifth and seventh levels of talent.”

“That’s good?” I asked. I’d guessed that the big bright lightshow was a good sign, but I hadn’t wanted to get my hopes up.

“Yes, as far as I know there’s only one person studying at the university now that is at the seventh level. Perhaps eight at the sixth level, and about fifty at the fifth level. Even as low as the second level the university tries its best to entice students to study there, they hand out substantial bursaries to people of your talent. Good students are worth quite a lot to the university,” he said, and I could just make out him glancing towards the cuffs on the nightstand.

I followed his gaze, “What is it?”

He sighed reluctantly, “Those manacles,” he hesitated, “They’re worth quite a lot to the university as well.”

*Fairly honest fellow.*

“How much money are we talking about here?” I asked.

“Those might be the first gold manacles that the university has ever had a chance to examine. They usually pay out ten thousand drachm just for the silver manacles, I have no idea how many they’d pay out for gold ones.”

*Holy fuck.*

A plan came to mind, a very good plan, “Tell you what. I want to get to Nimre, and I might need a little help with that,” I said, wiggling my arms, “If you help me get there, maybe introduce me to whoever it is admits new students, and you can have half the bounty.”

He perked up visibly at that, “I can certainly help with that, we can leave as soon as you’re feeling better.”

“I’m feeling better now,” I said, “I’ve spent the last two hundred days trying to get to Nimre, and it’s not been a pleasant two hundred days. I’m done waiting, I’m ready to go as soon as you are.”

He hopped up out of the chair, “I’ve got the clothes you were wearing downstairs drying by the fire-“

I shook my head, “Wearing Adympian clothes is another thing I’m done with, I’ve got my own clothes in that pack there,” I said, pointing to my bundle in the corner.

“I understand,” he said, and from his tone I didn’t doubt that for a second. He scooped up the bundle and held it out for me, “Um… Maybe my wife…”

*Right, dressing myself.*

“It’s fine,” I said, “I know Apportation, I’ll manage.”

He let out a relived breath, “Good, I’ll get my things together, I’ll be downstairs whenever you’re ready.”

He left me be, and I cast Apportation so I could dress myself. I started to do it with hand gestures, before stopping myself. I let out a long sigh, before casting it with a few words instead. I managed to dress without too much trouble, though Apportation’s manipulators were just as unfeeling as my hands were which made things somewhat difficult. I knew where they were, and what they were doing, but there was no feedback when I touched something.

-----

I left the small bedroom, shouldering my pack, and headed downstairs. His sitting room was rustic, but rather cosy. The walls were lined with overstuffed bookshelves, with more piled on tables and on a couple of the armchairs in the room. Judging from the light coming in through the windows it must have been early morning, and I could hear multiple someones bustling about in the next room.

“I can’t just let you two run off without having something to eat, your poor friend might not have had anything in days,” said a woman’s voice.

The healer, whose name I hadn’t thought to ask yet said, “It’s fine dear. We’ll teleport right over to Awan and we can eat there while I get ready for the jump to Nimre. There’s a nice café right near the beacon, the owner knows me, and they serve a very nice breakfast.”

*Teleportation,* ***and*** *food? That’s pretty cool.*

“Are you telling me that you’d rather have breakfast at a café than have me cook for you?” And I could imagine her threatening her husband with a rolling pin.

“Of course not,” he said, “But he’s very eager to be on his way, and I told you what he’s offered for me to help him get to the university.”

The wife sighed, “Fine, but you had better not be thinking of introducing him to Lili. I don’t want her anywhere near you.”

“Uhh…”

“Waenne! You can’t be serious!” said the woman, sounding upset.

“She’s on the admittance committee, and she loves meeting Outsiders. I’ll just introduce them, and be on my way, I promise,” he explained, a little desperately.

“Oh I think you know why she likes Outsiders so much,” she snapped.

“Cilla, there’s no need for that. I’ll be back tomorrow. Just there and back, I promise,” he said, and I heard a little smooch.

“Fine, but you’d better not come back smelling of her perfume,” she said, almost too quietly for me to hear.

“I promise Cilla, I’ll be back tomorrow.”

I turned to face one of the bookshelves, busying myself reading the titles, I did not want to be caught eavesdropping. They hadn’t been talking too loudly, but from what I could tell elven hearing wasn’t quite as good as human hearing. They might not have considered that they were speaking loud enough to be overheard.

“Ready to go?” Waenne asked.

I turned away from the bookshelves, “Yeah. By the way, I never got your name, I’m Quinn.”

“Ah, I’m Waenne,” he said, extending a hand.

I looked down at it, “Ah…”

“Sorry.”

“It’s fine.”

-----

We left his home, and I found that we were in a rather small village. I couldn’t make much out, but it had the same feeling as Essens or Letea. There were the same small cluster of houses, and the same dirt tracks leading between them. I followed as he lead the way towards the centre of town.

“Forgive me if it seems rude, but…” I started.

“Why would a Mage live here? When I could make twenty times as much working in the city? Any city?” He said, a little wryly.

“Ha, yeah, why do it?”

“My wife, Cilla. She was my sweetheart before I ever found out about my magic. This is where we grew up, and while I always wanted to see the big city, she always felt most comfortable here. I’d come back whenever I had a break to spend time with her, and when I finished my studies I decided to stay for good. I’ve certainly made my mistakes, hurt her when I didn’t mean to, but I’m happy here and she’s forgiven me,” he explained, a little hesitantly, “Besides,” he said, perking up a little, “There’s still good work to be done here. I’ve got most of the villages along the border linked with beacons, and I’ve gotten fairly good at dealing with those manacles. Someone needs to do it, it might as well be me.”

*Cilla, Sila. Is the universe trying to tell me something?*

“Well I certainly appreciate it. What about those beacons, what are those?” I asked.

“Ah, teleport beacons. You’ll learn more about this at the university, but a Teleport beyond more than five hundred or so yards is very difficult. Ten miles is the reasonable limit for most people, and even then it’s very difficult to do it accurately. If you want to teleport over long distances you need a pair of beacons, one at each end. We’re going to jump from the one here in town, to the one in Awan, then from Awan to Nimre.”

“Awan being the capital of Ashur?” I asked, and he nodded in reply. “How long ago did you set the beacons up, why weren’t there beacons already? It seems like if you had enough mages running around the country then most everywhere would already be linked together.”

“Maybe a decade ago, and depending on how you look at it everywhere is already linked together. Trouble is that most Mages, having gone to the trouble of making all their beacons, don’t share them with other Mages. Even small towns like this will have as many as a dozen beacons, but they’re nearly always enchanted so that only the Mage who created them and their friends can use them. Mine are public though, I haven’t set any limiting enchantments to prevent their use.”

*Note to self, set up massive network of beacons and charge for their use.*

“What about the ones between Awan and Nimre? Did you make those as well?”

“No, those ones are public. Most major cities are linked by public beacons, it’s the towns and villages that miss out,” he explained.

“So we’re going to be in Nimre in, what, ten minutes?” I asked.

“No, I’ll need to rest before making the jump to Nimre. We’ll have breakfast at a nice café that caters to just our sort of traveler while I recover my mana,” he said.

*Mana, right.*

My question would have to wait though, because we got to the town square where a small stone obelisk sat. It was maybe 3 feet tall, tapered at the top, and a foot across.

“Here we are, now just give me a moment,” Waenne said.

-----

Teleportation wasn’t nearly as interesting an experience as I thought it would be. One moment Waenne was gesticulating and chanting while I kept a hand on his shoulder, and the next we were in the middle of a city square. It might have been more interesting if my vision was better, but as it was the brown soft ground turned into grey hard ground, and the small buildings got a bit bigger and moved around, but that was it. I felt a slight passing nausea, but it faded almost as soon as it was noticed.

“You alright Quinn? The first teleport can make you awfully queasy,” He said, and from the looks of things it seemed like he was waiting to see if he was going to need to catch me or get out of the line of fire.

“I’m fine,” I said, “You said there’s a café somewhere nearby? I think the last time I’ve eaten was noon two days ago.”

“Two days? You should have mentioned something Quinn, you must be famished,” he said, seeming concerned.

“I’m fine,” I repeated.

“Well you weren’t jesting when you said your vision was bad, the café’s right here Quinn,” he said, nodding just to one side where I could see a blurry patio area, and an even blurrier building. We weren’t ten feet from the nearest table.

We found somewhere to sit, and I asked my burning question, “You mentioned that you needed to recover your mana, I don’t know if this is an impolite question to ask a Mage, but how much mana do you have? Or rather, how much mana do most Mages have?”

“Don’t worry, it’s not too impolite. You’ll get asked that question plenty by your instructors. I’ve got about twelve, depends on how much I’ve been exercising my magic. Most mages have about ten,” he explained.

*So I’m a physical cripple, as well as a magical cripple.*

“Have you worked out how much mana you have?” He asked.

“Yeah, one,” I said, not at all bitterly.

He was about to respond, but that was when our waiter shaped blur arrived to take our order. I ordered a truly ludicrous amount of food, and Waenne continued.

“One mana, are you sure?” He asked sceptically.

“Yeah, I did some tests with Apportation. Without this ring,” I said, nodding towards the mana stone ring, ”I can lift ten pounds. With the ring, I can lift twenty or thirty pounds, depending on whether I use a one or two point stone. That’s consistent with my other spells too, I can get candle light out of Light, but not torch light, unless I use one of the one point stones. I can cast the one point version of any of the spells I know, but can’t go beyond that without the ring.”

“That,” he started, sounding confused. I was sure he was also wearing a confused expression, but of course… “Doesn’t make any sense.”

I raised my hands, “I certainly don’t know how this works, you’re the Mage. You tell me.”

“Hmm. When you cast a spell how do you do it?” He asked, trying to put things together.

“Well I used to cast just with hand gesutures, though that’s not really an option any more. Now I do it with the incantation,” I explained, and I cast the spell to demonstrate.

And also so I could feed myself.

Waenne leaned back, taking a sip of his tea, “Sounds a lot like you don’t have any mana at all. Actually, ah, I hope I’m not brining up any bad memories, but what sort of, ah, slave, were you in Adympia?”

“I was a steward, and you said I might not have any mana? What do you mean?”

“Well. You managed to keep your magic secret then?” He asked.

“Yeah, not that I had to try too hard. Some guard waved a stick at me, and said I wasn’t a Mage,” I said.

“Well, the Adympians test to see if someone is a Mage by checking to see whether they have mana or not. Only Wizards and Mages have mana, and while it’s not as precise as what they’ll do at the university to see what level of ability you have, it works. So if they checked you, and the result came up negative, then you probably don’t have any mana,” he said, as if that explained everything.

“That,” I started, “Doesn’t make any sense. I can cast spells, I just cast a spell,” I said, waving around a scone with my manipulator.

“Well sure, but you cast it with just the one or two words. Between that and your fairly high talent, I’m pretty sure you know the spell well enough to not need any mana to cast it. At least if you’re not trying to do too much with the spell.”

“Ah,” I began, *I don’t understand at all,* “Can you elaborate?”

“Alright,” he said, setting aside his finished meal, and gesturing with a fork, “Any spell you cast requires mana. The thing is, you don’t provide all of that mana. It depends on the spell, but most of the time you only provide a tiny amount to get the spell started, then the spell feeds on the ambient mana that surrounds all of us. You might need to chip in a little more every minute or so, but you’re not feeding most of the energy into the spell yourself. The thing is, if you’re skilled enough you might be able to give the spell a little push without spending any of your own mana at all. That’s why you can cast Apportation or Light. Of course, if you want a bigger effect, you need to provide a bigger push. That’s why you can’t get more out of either of the spells.”

“What about the incantations and the gestures then, is that related to the ‘push’ in any way,” I asked, this was starting to make sense. I didn’t have an infinite mana recovery rate after all.

“Ah, not really. In theory any Mage could cast any spell without anything more than a thought. The words or the gestures aren’t actually required, they serve more as a memory aid when you’re trying to form the spell. The fact that you can already cast spells with the bare minimum of incantations is a pretty good sign though. Even talent alone wouldn’t account for that, you’d need to be fairly bright as well.”

I smiled, “Why thank you. What about casting spells with a thought then, how hard is that? And is there any reason to do the gestures and incantations if you can cast it with only a thought?”

“It’s fairly hard. Even very skilled Mages can usually only cast a few spells with nothing but a thought. You need to know the spell very, very well. Most of the time it’ll be something that could be used to get yourself out of a bind. Personally the only spell I know well enough to cast with a thought is Reshape. It’s not an easy one by any means, but it lets the caster mould stone or metal like clay. It’s a little insurance against capture. As for the gestures,” he said, waving a hand, “Well, if you want to be really particular, no, they’re not necessary. It can guard against mishaps though, sometimes you haven’t got the spell quite straight in your head, and doing the dance and singing the song can help smooth over any bumps. I usually only bother doing that when I’m teleporting. I don’t want to end up in the wrong city after all.”

“So. What am I supposed to do then? I kinda feel like having no mana is a pretty major hindrance when it comes to this whole ‘magic’ thing.”

He laughed, “Sorry, it’s just funny when you put it like that,” he said, trying to stifle the laughter, “Well you can exercise your magic, just like you exercise your body. Do it enough and you might be able to eke out a small increase. Probably not more than four or five more mana though. You might want to invest heavily in mana stones once you get to the university. You’re already off to a decent start after all,” he finished, gesturing at the ring in question.

“How fast do these regenerate anyway? I’d guessed about one point per day, but I’m not sure.”

“Yeah, about one per day. If you’re in an area with higher than normal mana it’ll be faster, but not by a whole lot.”

“What about a Mages own mana?”

“Depends on the Mage. That’s another thing you can train to get better at, but usually it takes about ten minutes.”

“Damn, so even with a pocket full of mana stones I’m still going to have a pretty big handicap then,” I sighed.

“I’m afraid so,” he said.

“And the bigger stones are even more expensive aren’t they?”

“Yup.”

“Dammit.”

“Ha! Yup.”

I sighed.

I finished eating my pile of food, and Waenne paid, and we took our places by the obelisk to make the jump to Nimre.

-----



-----

The jump to Nimre was much like the jump to Awan, sudden change in the splotchy scenery, slight nausea, and we were there. Waenne seemed to need a moment though, holding his stomach and putting a hand on the obelisk to steady himself.

“You alright?” I asked. He seemed a little green, and I wasn’t just talking about his hair.

“Oh I’m fine,” he said, straightening and taking deep breaths, “I’m just surprised you’re taking it so well. I remember the first time my instructor had my team all try a teleport. Bastard did it right after taking us out for a nice big lunch, I don’t think any of us managed to keep our food down. And you just tucked away enough food to feed a small army.”

“Well that might be one upside to being mostly blind. All the teleport really does for me is change the general colour scheme of all the different coloured blurry patches I can see,” I said, trying to find something positive about my situation.

“That bad then?” He asked, sympathetically.

“Yeah. My glasses would correct my vision to about human normal. Even with those though I’m fairly sure my vision was much less acute than an elf’s. Without them?” I held my hand about a foot from my face, “About here is where I can start to make out detail. Further than that, and it’s all one big mess.”

We were quiet for a little as we walked towards where Waenne had said the university was, and then he asked a really annoying question.

“Why do you want to learn magic Quinn?”

“Does it matter?” I asked, and I had to stop myself from being too flippant. He had saved me from pain induced insanity after all.

“Yes Quinn, it does. You’ll want to have a good answer. It’s one of the things you’ll be asked before you’re admitted. It’ll be easier since you talent seems to be pretty high, but you still need a good answer. So, why do you want to learn magic?”

I took a breath, “I don’t know. It’s certainly better than staying where I landed when I was dropped off by the Banestorm. It’s a better opportunity, it will let me see and do more. Well, do more at least.”

“Quinn… Have you ever considered that magic might not be right for you?”

“What?” I said sharply, “Why wouldn’t it be right for me?”

“Well, where were you a couple of hours ago?” He asked.

“In your house? In bed I guess,” I was not sure where this was going.

“And you’d just escaped slavery, and then endured a day of torture from those manacles, right?”

“Yes?”

“And then, you leap out of bed, not stopping to rest, and insist that we go to Nimre immediately.”

“Yeah, I’m sorry if I was kind of demanding, but I’ve been trying to get here since almost the first week I’ve been on Elardia,” I said.

“That's not what I'm talking about, Quinn. It’s like I said, magic takes passion, and this is something your instructors might challenge you on. After all you’ve been though, I don’t know what you had to do in Adympia, or what you had to do to escape, but it can’t have been pleasant. Then you follow that with a day of constant torture, Quinn, most people that we don’t find in the first few hours are dead. Not from the manacles, but at their own hands, you endured a full day of that. Then you’re perfectly fine the next morning? I want to know, and your instructors will want to know what's driving you. Why are you enduring all that hardship? You seem almost not to care. When you were eating for example, did you even enjoy it?”

“What-” I sighed, “What does it even matter if I enjoyed it or not? I was hungry, it’s like you said, I was famished. So I ate.”

“Quinn,” then **he** sighed. There was a lot of sighing happening, “How about an easier question. What makes you happy?”

*Fuck.*

It took me more time that I’d like to admit for me to come up with a solution, “Games I guess. The games here aren’t quite as complex or varied as they were back home,” *I miss my computer,* “But Zatrikion, dice, cards, they’re fun I guess.”

“You guess?” He prodded.

“I don’t know man. Magic makes me happy I suppose,” I said resignedly.

*That might* ***be*** *my answer in fact.*

“Magic and games then?” He asked, “That’s it?”

*Do I explain myself to this guy? Why the hell not.*

I took a quick peek around, I didn’t want anyone too close to overhear. I did not like sharing things about myself.

“I’m very intelligent Waenne, and I don’t just mean that I’m a bit more clever than the average person. I’m smart enough, that I can learn pretty much any skill, pick up any hobby, anything. I’ve been to a university already, one back home. And I’ve been in a lot of school before that. On Earth humans are in school usually from the time they’re five years old, to the time they’re twenty. That might not sound like much for an elf, but a human usually only lives to be about eighty. I’ve never had to try. Never. I barely studied, and I’d still come out of it near the top of my class. The only kids that would keep ahead of me were the ones that would go home every night and study for hours. Any skill, any subject, I could pick up and learn faster than anyone. Hell, most of the time when I guess the answer to something, I find out that I was dead on. But I never mastered anything. I never was at the **top** of my class, I was never the **best** at anything. I could be really very good, with barely any effort, but I was always too lazy to be more than that. I just never cared enough. Why bother? I wasn’t like I was settling for average either, I was good, and people knew it.”

I paused, finding myself short of breath. Waenne’s eyes had been locked on me since I’d started speaking.

“It did not earn me a lot of friends. I’d like to say that it was jealousy, and maybe it was. Mostly it was arrogance though. I’d show up with an eleven page term paper written in a couple of hours and get an A. Someone else would get an A+, but for them the paper represented a month of late nights in the library.”

I was getting a little off track, I had a point to make after all.

“The point is, I’ve never needed to try to be good at anything. Except for games. That was the one thing where I could find a decent challenge, a reason to try harder. Every game had new rules, new nuances to just how it was played. I had to try. I’d start good, very good, but with games at least I wasn’t willing to settle for that. I don’t know how to begin to explain what the internet is, but it’s enough to say that if I wanted to find the absolute best players in the world at any given game, I could. Now that option is taken from me. I can sit down at a table in any given tavern, and pick up whatever game they’re playing, and win. Hell, when it comes to cards, it’s more of an effort for me to not win too much. But magic? I want magic. I **want** it. You said that I lack passion? Magic might be the only thing in the world that I’m passionate about.”

I looked him right in the eye, or at least, I looked right where I thought his eye was, “How’s that for an answer?”

“You’re wound up pretty tight aren’t you Quinn?” he said, humour in his voice.

I choked out a laugh, “Yeah. Yeah I am.”

“Well I think that answer will do just fine,” he said, seeming satisfied.

“Um, I don’t suppose that you’re secretly one of the people in charge of finding new mages, and that this has all been a test?” Come on, genre savvyness has to help a little here.

“That’s a good guess,” he said brightly, “but no. I did teach at the university for a little while, but only ever to Wizards. I stay at home with Cilla now.”

“Damn. Oh, does that mean that I’m going to need to repeat that whole speech to whoever you introduce me to then?”

“Yup!”

“Dammit.”

“Maybe tone it down a little though, in fact, maybe just skip to the end there. ‘Magic might be the only thing in the world that I’m passionate about’ is a really good line. The rest of the stuff just makes you sound like an arrogant prick.”

*Well…*

# Chapter 24

Quinn

-----

“How much further is it to the University,” I asked.

We’d already been walking for ten or fifteen minutes since leaving the obelisk that served as Nimre’s teleport beacon.

“When? We’re here Quinn, the beacon was just inside the front gates. All of this around us is the university,” he said, and I could hear the smile in his voice.

*Holy shit. This place is huge.*

“Wow, I’m sure this would all be super impressive if I could see any of it,” I said, “How big is this place? I think Ventia might have even been smaller.”

“Almost. There’s usually about thirty thousand students at the university at any given time, add on the instructors and all the little shops that serve the university and I think you end up with something like forty thousand people living just within the university quarter. Ventia has over fifty thousand people living in it, so it’s close.”

*It’s only about a half the size of U of T, but U of T has got all of Toronto and a modern transit system to feed it.*

“Damn, what about the rest of the city? Aren’t there other universities and schools here in Nimre?” I asked.

“Not sure about the rest of the city, I think it’s about another forty thousand people. I honestly never really left the university much. Nimre isn’t too bad, but there’s still some resentment towards Mages that come down from the university and start ‘making trouble’.”

“Yeah, I think I can understand that.”

*Drunk college students with super powers? Yeah, I can see how that would be a problem.*

“I mean, it’s not too terrible. The city has the power it has and is as rich as it is because of the presence of the university, but… it’s complicated. I might not be the Mage to ask about this sort of thing, but there’s a bit of fear of the unknown, bit of jealousy, and all it takes is for one student to make a mess to piss off all the ‘normal’ folk.”

“Ha, and I’m guessing that the average student Mage can make one hell of a mess.”

“Oh Hala,” he said, putting a hand to his forehead, “The Order of the Claves…”

“The Order of the what?” I asked, confused.

“They’re one of the university’s major guilds. They’re known for their little ‘jests’. I think their members are still probably banned from most of the lower city after the whole mess with the Font of Endless Custard.”

*Font of Endless… Well I guess magical matter creation is a possibility.*

I was about to ask him to elaborate, but it seemed that we’d arrived.

“Here we are,” he said, indicating the truly massive building that we’d stopped in front of, “This is the Arena. You might be spending a lot of time here, depending on how much you focus on combat magic.”

He lead the way inside, and I what I could see of it reminded very much of the Colosseum in Rome. The building must have risen about fifty metres in the air, and it had the same multi-tiered set of arches all the way around the rim of it.

“Your instructors will probably take you here to practice safely, and you can even take part in tournaments and melees if you’re feeling a little competitive.”

“Safely? So I could, I don’t know, throw a lightning bolt at someone, and it wouldn’t hurt them?”

“Well, see for yourself,” he said, as we came out into open air.

We were at ground level, and the seats rose in tiers behind me. There was a short wall in front of me, then a drop of about three metres to the actual floor of the Arena. There were very few spectators present, with only the occasional splotch of colour against the grey stone to mark where someone sat. Even standing at the very edge, it was hard to make out the figures fighting. One was large, very large for an elf. He must have been about close to my height, but he was built thickly enough to make the Rock look small. The other was slight of build, and at this distance I couldn’t tell if they were man or woman. Elf men seemed to keep their hair about as long as elf women, though the smaller figure did have theirs in a ponytail which was the style that elf men seemed to favour.

This being a magical contest, I was expecting the smaller figure to blast the huge one into the nearest wall in short order. After all, Strength is a dump stat for a proper spellcaster. They stand at the back of the party and fling fireballs, they didn’t waste time lifting weights. The big man might have a chance if he could get in close, but any proper Mage wasn’t about to allow that to happen.

The smaller figure shouted a word, and there was a crack of thunder. A bolt of lightning streaked from their outstretched hand, but the blinding blue-white light stopped about a foot from the hulking Mage. It seemed to strike an invisible wall and then ground itself out in the hard-packed sand of the arena. The hulking Mage said nothing, and instead he threw both hands forwards. Twin bolts of fire streaked towards the smaller Mage, who snapped out a short word and made a slight gesture. The bolts of fire seemed to veer slightly off course, and they both passed harmlessly to either side.

The two bolts were maybe a foot behind the smaller Mage when they both exploded with a loud ‘WHOOMPFF’. Even at this distance I could feel the pressure wave hit my chest, and the smaller mage was thrown forwards, hair and clothes aflame. He landed face first, and I could see that his back was charred black, and his arms were little better than burnt sticks.

*Holy fuck!*

“Holy fuck!” I exclaimed, “Is he dead?”

“No no, don’t worry. He’ll be back on his feet in a minute or two. The magic of the Arena is designed specifically for this sort of thing. Clothes, anything you bring along, those can get damaged or destroyed, but people aren’t actually hurt.”

*So it’s like a magical Danger Room. Danger Arena?*

“It feels like it hurts though, so it’s still best to avoid getting blown up or decapitated.”

“Decapitated? What?”

“Barely ever happens,” he said, laughing and patting me on the shoulder, “But the Arena will protect you even from that. Come on, we’ve got to meet Lili.”

He led the way back through the tunnel, and I continued my line of questioning, “How does it work? It seems like you’d want to just blanket the whole city with an enchantment like that. I bet it would cut down on murders by about one hundred percent.”

“I’m the wrong sort to ask for specifics, but I’m fairly sure that the Arena only works like it does because of the ley line nexus below it. That’s used to power some sort of planar enchantment. I never really studied that sort of thing much, but I don’t think that the enchantment could be sustained without such a large source of power.”

*Ley lines, planar enchantments? I think I’m going to have fun here.*

“Planar, so the Arena is in a different plane of existence?” I asked.

“Sort of, I think? The area within the walls at least. All I know is that the ‘rules’ are different when you’re standing in the pit. Whichever Mages built the Arena found a plane where people couldn’t be hurt permanently or where magic worked a little different, and then used the nexus to make a little bubble so they could practice and fight there.”

*So there’s different planes of existence, and some have different laws of physics. Hold on, are this world’s laws of physics different from Earth’s? I mean, the presence of magic does seem to suggest that there’s something funky going on.*

I had so many questions, but it felt like I didn’t know enough to make sense of the answers, so I stuck to what I could understand.

“Who were those two in the Arena?” I asked.

“The elf I’m not sure about, but I’ve heard about that living mountain, even out as far as Ashur. That’s Nothus, probably the single most talented, and most powerful Mage currently studying in the university.”

*Note to self, befriend Nothus as soon as possible.*

-----

Waenne led me to a large, low building that seemed to share a lot with some of the older buildings at the University of Toronto. It wasn’t quite Queen Anne architecture, but it was very close. We went inside, and climbed the stairs to the third floor where Waenne told me that many of the instructors had their offices. Thankfully the ceilings here weren’t too low, and I could just barely stand up straight. I followed Waenne to a slightly open door, and he knocked lightly on the doorframe before poking his head in.

“Waenne!” Said a woman’s voice,  “I haven’t seen you in ages. I’m surprised Cilla let you out of the house. What’s the occasion?”

Waenne sighed, “You know it’s not like that, Lili. I-“

“Isn’t it?” Lili taunted.

Waenne tilted his head to the side, and I was sure that he was giving her a look, “I’ve got a new student for you.”

He stepped into the room, and waved me forwards, “Say hello, Quinn.”

I stepped into the small room, and could at least make out the general details. The wall behind the desk was covered by several well-ordered bookshelves, there was a large window on the far wall, and there were a few art pieces hanging from the other two. At the desk sat a small woman, she seemed small even for an elf, and she wore what looked like long blue robes. She had long gold hair, and big blue eyes. Her robes were closed, but I could see that they swelled out fairly generously around the bust area. I could see why Cillia was a little possessive, even half blind I could see that Lili was a bombshell.

“Hello Quinn,” I said.

Waenne sighed, but Lili pushed her chair back, and came around to the front of her desk.

“Nice to meet you Quinn,” she said, extending a hand.

“Uh,” I hesitated, then I extended my own hand, “Here?”

She seemed a little confused, but grasped my hand. Hers was tiny compared to mine, her middle finger was even smaller than my little finger.

“Oh? Oh.” She said, looking down. She took my hand in both of hers, turning it over, “Can you feel anything at all?” She asked, tracing her fingers over my palm.

“Nope. Everything up to the elbows might as well be made of wood,” I said flatly.

She looked to Waenne, “The manacles were on, and active for at least a full day before I removed them,” he said, seeming almost guilty, despite the fact that what happened to me wasn’t his fault.

“You poor thing,” she soothed, and I pulled my hand back.

*Not pity. Never pity.*

“I can manage,” I said, trying not to snap at her.

“I’m sorry,” she said, “I didn’t mean to offend.”

“It’s fine,” I said quietly.

There was an awkward silence, before Waenne spoke up, “Well Lili, I thought it might be best if I bring Quinn right to you. He’s fairly talented, if the mage stone is any indication, and he, uh…”

“Might need a little help getting around,” I finished, looking down at my useless hands. Even at this distance, they were blurry and out of focus.

Lili looked up at me, questioningly, “The hands I can deal with, I know Apportation, I can manage. The trouble is, I’m just about half blind. Even at this distance, I can barely make out your facial features.”

“Did this also happen in Adympia?” Lili asked sympathetically.

*I’m already tired of explaining this.*

“Sort of. I caught the end of a spear with my face, which broke my glasses. They’re a sort of wire frame, with a pair of corrective glass lenses. With them I could see fine, at least when compared to other humans. Without out them, well. My vision sucks.”

“I might have something that can help,” she said, turning to rummage in the desk, though I didn’t get my hopes up.

“Here,” she said, holding out a necklace in the shape of a hawk feather, “It sounds like it won’t be quite as good as your glasses, but it should help a little.”

“Thank you,” I said, putting it on, “How does it work?” I asked, not seeing any difference.

“Just tap it,” She said, “Like this,” and she touched the little feather where it lay on my chest.

The sudden change was disorienting, and I nearly stumbled back into a table. My vision had narrowed right down, and while it was now flawless, better than flawless, my field of vision was maybe ten degrees across. Instead of wearing a pair of glasses, this was like looking through a telescope. I turned to look at Waenne, and this time the disorientation was enough for me to lose my balance. My ass hit the floor, and I had to close my eyes to avoid throwing up. I patted at my chest with numb hands, trying to turn the little necklace off. I must have looked rather foolish, but eventually the enchantment snapped off, so I must have found my mark.

I opened my eyes to see the once again blurry forms of Waenne and Lili standing over me with concern.

“Are you alright?” Lili asked.

“I’m fine,” I said, still feeling nauseas, “But I think that’s going to take some getting used to.”

*But at least magical vision correction is possible, even if fixing my eyes directly is not.*

Waenne helped me up, and I was reminded of just how strong elves were, despite their small size.

*If Nothus has the same sort of strength as an elf… Damn.*

“Quinn,” Lili asked, once Waenne and I were seated across from her at her desk, “How did you manage to avoid being discovered as a Mage? Unless…” She looked to Waenne, and he shook his head,

“No collar,” he said simply.

“Waenne helped me sort out the answer to that. They check to see if someone has mana, right?” She nodded, “Well I’ve got none.”

“Pardon me? None?” She asked, leaning forwards.

I spread my hands, “I thought at first that I had exactly one, since I could only ever cast spells at their lowest level of effect, but apparently I have none.”

“Hmmm,” she tapped her chin with one finger, “Well that definitely shows that you’ve got some talent, and you’ve got to be fairly clever too. Can you, uh,” She said, waving at the hand that bore the mage stone.

“Sure,” I said, and I could see that Waenne was already shielding his eyes.

The stone bloomed to life, and Lili pulled back. I’d been too busy giggling at Waenne to notice that she’d been staring right at it.

“Alright, Alright, that’s enough thank you,” She said, rubbing at her eyes.

I let the light go out, “I hope you’ve got good news for me?” I asked.

“Oh I think so,” she said, “I don’t think that even Nothus put on quite the same light show as you did just now.”

*Sweet.*

“Why don’t we go downstairs, it’s fairly quiet today, I think we shouldn’t have any trouble finding you a spot so we can get some tests done,” Lili said.

“Tests?” I asked.

“Oh, numbers, reading, that sort of thing, and we’ll get a better idea of just how much magical talent you’ve got.”

-----

The three of us made our way downstairs, though Waenne did not follow Lili and I to the classroom where they had the tests.

“I’ll meet up with you after,” he said, “I’m going to check in with some friends I haven’t seen in a while. They won’t let me in the classroom anyway while you’re writing your entrance exams.”

“Alrigh- Hold on, I thought they were tests. Now they’re exams?” I said, suddenly a little anxious.

“Don’t worry, you’ll do fine,” he said, and I could more hear the smile than see it.

-----

Lili and I were just in time for the next round of tests, unless they were exams, and I followed the small group of students into the room. It was very much like a classroom on Earth, there was a chalk board, plenty of desks, and what might have been posters with charts or diagrams along the walls. There were maybe sixty desks, though only about ten students, not including myself. Lili had said that most students had already either written their exams, unless they were tests, or wouldn’t be here until the last week of admittance. This meant that it was fairly quiet, both here in the classroom, and in the university in general. I’d asked her, rather anxiously, about what I might be tested on and she’d assured me that it was nothing complicated. Some reading comprehension, some mathematics, basic puzzle solving, with some logic questions. It reminded me of and IQ tests, or the sort of aptitude test that the military might have new recruits do.

I need not have worried. This test seemed like it was intended for the absolute lowest common denominator. This wasn’t a test for people that were three and a half years into a Computer Science degree, it was a test for medieval peasants, and the odd noble that had someone to tutor them. In fact, of the ten other students, seven of them had someone sitting on a stool next to them, reading the test out to them, and they were dictating their answers back so that they could be written down.

I was done in all of ten minutes.

I set the parchments aside, and raised a hand to indicate that I was done, and Lili came over.

“What’s wrong?” she asked, looking at the papers I’d pushed aside, and then back to me.

“Nothing, I’m done. Can we leave, or do I need to wait?”

She raised her eyebrows, “We can go,” she said, scooping up the papers. I especially enjoyed the dirty looks I got from the pair of what must have been nobles, or sons of nobles, as I left.

We went into the next room, where a pair of what I assumed to be teachers were chatting. One had the reddish brown skin and short stature of a gnome, and the other looked to be a city elf with his silver hair.

“Something wrong?” One asked, looking between myself and Lili.

“No,” Lili smiled, “Quinn here is all done. Could you check over his work Djeta while Sisaru helps me sort out just how talented Quinn is?”

The gnome, Djeta I guessed, shrugged, “Sure,” he said, in a surprisingly deep voice for such a small creature.

Lili handed over my test, and then indicated a chair that faced the city elf across a low table, “Please, take a seat.”

I sat while the elf, Sisaru, fished around in a bag for something. A moment later he dropped a truly massive crystal onto the table. The thing must have been as big as my head, and it was a deep purple. It was rough, but polished, and seemed to be all once piece.

“I take it that you have used a mage stone before?” Sisaru asked, and I nodded, “Well this is exactly the same. You focus on the stone, and through it I will be able to sort out just where you belong.”

From the looks of him, I’d have guessed that Sisaru wasn’t much older than myself. For an elf, that might still put him somewhere in his forties, but it was the voice that threw a wrench into that assumption. He spoke like someone that was very, very old. He didn’t speak slowly, but each word was deliberate, and had weight to it.

I did as bade, and put my hands on the stone.

“Whenever you are ready,” Sisaru said, in his ancient voice.

The crystal flared to life, though not nearly as brightly as my ring had. It was too bright to look directly into, but I didn’t need to avert my eyes.

“Hmm, very good,” Sisaru said after a moment, taking his hands away from the big crystal.

*Eighth level, eighth level, eighth level…*

“You’re at the sixth level,” he said.

*Damn.*

“Really?” Lili asked, “You should have seen the way that his ring lit up in my office.”

“Oh? Why don’t you show me Quinn?” He said.

I showed him, and the difference in brightness was clear to see.

“I’d guessed at least ninth level, what’s the reason for the difference?” Lili asked.

He seemed to consider the question before speaking, “There are a few causes that come to mind, though what is most likely is that Quinn here has a particularly strong Will. Strictly speaking, that is what the smaller stones are really testing after all. Speaking practically, you will be better able to resist magic used against you. It is not immunity mind you, but it does help a great deal.”

“Hmm, that does sound good,” I said, it was nice to have a little peace of mind.

“How would Quinn compare to Neferoy then?” Lili asked, leaning forwards and resting her chin in her hand.

“Oh, Neferoy would definitely have the advantage,” he said immediately, “Neferoy is not immune either, but she is as close as anyone can hope to be.”

“Neferoy?” I asked, looking between the two of them.

“One of my students, she’s a dwarf, and shares her race’s resistance to magic,” Lili explained, “Oh, you’ve marked it then?”

I turned to see Djeta walking over, parchments in hand, “Yes, I can’t make sense of the mess on the maths portion of the test, but the answers are correct. All of them, perfect score, well done.”

I grinned, “Thanks,” I said, “How many students usually get a perfect score?”

*Is it none?*

“Oh a few, sons and daughters of nobles and merchants usually, though you’re the first to finish so quickly,” he said.

*Aw, well I guess that’s good enough.*

Djeta laid out the test on the table, flipping to the math portion, “I was wondering about this,” he said, pointing to where I’d converted from pseudo-Roman numerals, *Elardian numerals?* to Arabic numerals to finish the questions more quickly.

-----

Lili had to drag Djeta away about twenty minutes later, when some of the other students started to come in to have their own tests marked. Djeta had taken to the new numbering system like a fish to water, and I’d barely noticed the time go by as I explained the system and answered his eager questions. He seemed willing to make the uppity pair of nobles wait, and it was only after some prodding from Lili that he got up to see to them. He made me promise, once we both had some free time, to come see him in his office to tell him more.

“Come on,” Lili said, “Sisaru has got to check over our new arrivals, and we might as well go by the bursar to get you your own money. We’ll also need get you a room until we find a club to put you in.”

“Club?”

“A group of people that meet to talk about shared interests, you don’t have clubs where you come from?” She teased, and I gave her a look. She grinned, wide enough for me to notice despite the poor quality of my vision, “Clubs are little groups of ten or twelve. So instead of having on professor for a lecture hall of a few hundred students, which is what we do for the less talented Mages, we’ve got one instructor for each club. Everyone learns a little differently, especially when you consider the differences in magical ability between those with lots of talent, and those with little, so this lets us tailor the instruction to each student.”

“I’m guessing that the pace of instruction is quite a bit faster?” I asked.

“Well, it depends. If you’re in the lecture stream then it’s a little more regimented, there are specific classes to take, though you can choose your area of focus,” she said, *sounds like an undergraduate program,* “But if you’re in the club stream then you’ve got a lot more independence. It will be up to you to decide just what it is you’re trying to accomplish, and your instructor will be there to help you along.”

*Sounds like a graduate or doctoral program.*

“There are classes to take, but those are a lot smaller as well. Depending on the popularity of the subject, and the teacher, you might only have twenty or so classmates.”

“Sounds like I’m going to enjoy my time here,” I said, smiling a little.

*Right, Time.*

“Quick question though, how long does a student usually spend learning here?” I asked.

“Well, it depends on the Mage, but some people stay almost indefinitely,” she said.

“Indefinitely?”

“It means-“ And I elbowed her lightly, she giggled, “There’s always more magic to learn Quinn. I switched from student to professor some time ago, but even I still take time out to learn more. Teaching is often one of the best ways to learn more about a subject. Mmm, especially if you join one of the guilds. Most guild Mages do stay indefinitely.”

“Oh? I think Waenne mentioned something about a guild, The Order of the Claves? What are they anyway?”

She laughed, “Right, the thing with the Font of Endless Custard, I remember that. I think they flooded two or three streets in the lower city. The Order of the Claves are one of the twelve, well, eleven, major guilds. The major guilds are basically an organization of the students, and a couple of the teachers, from the university. The hierarch of each guild is a bit above a Count in rank, and a bit below a Duke.”

“Really, do they control any land, or is their rank a result of the number of mages that they have answering to them?”

*If I was a medieval Count I wouldn’t want to screw with a guy that might have a twelfth of the university’s Mages at his command.*

“A little of both. A decent portion of Nimre’s land is controlled by the university, I think it’s nearly half. That area is split between the guilds. The guilds answer to the university itself, and the university answers to the Emperor.”

“So Nimre is a magocracy then? Or at least, part of it is?” I asked, the thought of a bunch of college students ruling anything seemed like a terrible idea.

*And it explains why the rest of Nimre is a little resentful.*

“Yes, part of it. A big part, but only a part. The rest is organized much like any of the other empires, do you…”

“Oh, yeah I’m familiar with the general idea, though I’m guessing that there’s some Elardia specific concepts that I’ll need to pick up along the way,” I reassured.

“I’m impressed Quinn. Very few of the students that arrive here are quite as educated as you seem to be, even Minki, and her father is an Archduke.”

*Does Crusader Kings 2 count as an education?*

I smiled, “I think I’ve probably got an unfair advantage there. I’ve been in school at least thirty hours a week, eight months out of twelve, since I was five years old. I don’t think anyone here in Elardia is crazy enough for that sort of schedule.”

She looked up at me, surprise evident on her face, “Since you were five, how old are you?”

“Well,” I paused, *How long have I been here? Has my birthday passed already?* “I’m twenty three.”

“That is quite the pace of study, and that’s normal for Humans?” She asked.

“Yeah, some people stop around eighteen if they’re not planning on continuing to university or college though.”

“I’ll have to ask Brandy what her education was like then, you said you were twenty three, you seem surprisingly mature for someone so young,” she said.

*Brandy? There’s no way in hell that any elf is named Brandy.*

“Well, that’s the thing,” I said, Brandy would have to wait, “Humans don’t live quite as long as elves do. With good healthcare, which hopefully magic can provide, I can expect to live to eighty or ninety. Though ninety would be pushing the limit. One hundred is possible, but unlikely.”

She stopped dead, and I turned to look back at her, “That’s not fair,” she said, seeming offended rather than sad or worried.

I smiled, but it was bittersweet, “I think you’re the second person to tell me that. I’ve heard life extension magic mentioned, is that possible? Would it work for a human?”

She strode up to me, and took my arm, “Yes. Yes it does. We’re going to the bursar, and then we’re getting this sorted out.”

She hurried me along, which was an impressive feat considering how much shorter her stride was.

-----

We didn’t need to wait long for the bursar, there was only one other person there to see him, and I leaned on the counter while I let Lili do the talking.

“Lili,” said the man behind the desk, not rudely, though he did seem thoroughly uninterested.

“Abil,” she acknowledged.

I’d expected a librarian looking sort, with wire rimmed spectacles and a scrunched up face, but then elves don’t need glasses, and they seem to age much more gracefully than humans do.

“His level of talent?” he asked.

“Six.”

He handed me a broach with some sort of seal on it, *the university’s seal?*

“One thousand, nine hundred, and twenty drachm. Don’t spend it all in one place,” he said, in a way that made it sound like this was the thousandth time he’d made that ‘joke’.

*One thousand and what?*

“Pardon me? Is that what this thing is worth?” I asked, turning the thing over in my hands. It did seem to be made of solid silver, and it was fairly large, about the size of a loonie, but nineteen hundred drachm seemed like a stretch.

“No,” Lili said, “This just lets you access your account here at the university. If you want to take some physical coins out then you can, but this will work anywhere in the city, and in most of the larger cities throughout Nimre.”

*Magical debit card, sweet.*

“Works for me, and this is what, this year’s bursary?” I asked.

*Five and a bit drachm a day, so roughly two and a half times the income of your average labourer? Not too bad.*

“If only,” said Abil, in his bored voice.

Lili smiled, “No, this is the bursary for this month.”

I blinked. *DAMN.*

“Well, thank you very much Abil,” I said sincerely, I could see why he had his reservations.

*I’ve never been to a university that* ***pays*** *you to learn there, but I think I like it.*

He waved a hand, “You’re welcome, though I’m not the one paying you.”

“Thanks all the same, I do have one question though. Who would I see about the bounty on these?” I asked, taking the two gold cuffs out of my pocket, and setting them on the counter between us.

Lili’s eyes got even bigger than usual, and Abil sighed heavily.

“That’s me as well. I’ll move another hundred thousand drachm to your account,” he said, as if the colossal sum of money was no more valuable than a sack of grain that he was moving from one cupboard to another.

It took me a minute to pick my jaw up off the floor, and I think my eyes might have turned into dollar signs.

*Damn, and now I’ve got to give half to Waenne.*

I really didn’t want to, and if I’d been smarter I would have set a specific value, but he’d held up his end of the deal so I wasn’t about to back out.

“I owe half of it to Waenne,” I said, “Can you transfer half to him? Does he even still have one of these broach thingies?”

“It’s your mark as a student, it is not a ‘thingy’” Abil said sternly, “But yes, I can transfer half to Waenne.”

“How’d you end up with that deal?” Lili asked wryly, as we left Abil to his own devices.

“I promised him half if he could get me here. I had some idea of what it was worth, but not precisely. Its fine I guess, I got what I wanted after all, I’m here.”

-----

As it turns out, you can have immortality, and it only costs a hundred drachm. At least, as long as you’re a Mage.

Well, it wasn’t quite immortality, and it wasn’t quite one hundred drachm. Lili had shown me to what was apparently the magical version of a hospital, and I allowed a small plump lady to place an enchantment on me. It would freeze my aging process for a single year. After that year was up I’d start to age as normal.

I of course, cried foul almost immediately.

“How in the hell can magic grant immortality, but not fix my hands or eyes?” I asked, a little exasperated.

“Immortality is simple,” said the plump woman, Nidab was her name, “Eyes are complicated, and so is fixing your hands.”

“Immortality is simple. Really. And it’s simpler than an eye?”

“All I need to do to make you immortal is make sure that you **don’t** change. Fixing your eye, well,” she waved her hands in my general direction, “I wouldn’t even know where to begin. I could give you someone else’s eyes, but they’d be too big, and even if they weren’t too big they still probably wouldn’t work.”

“Fine,” I said, throwing up my hands, “And this will last a year? Why only a year, what do I do after that?”

“Well you could get me to redo the enchantment,” Nidab said, “But it’s more likely that you’ll have learned to do it yourself by then. Immortality isn’t that hard after all. And it only lasts a year, because that’s how long the enchantment can hold together.”

“What does the enchantment do exactly?”

“Lili?” Nidab asked, “You’re better at explaining this sort of thing.”

“Sure,” Lili said, “The enchantment takes advantage of the fact that you’re able to channel mana naturally, even if you have none of your own, and uses the ambient mana to power the spell. And like Nidab said, the spell just freezes your age where it is now. It only takes a little mana, and there’s always plenty around. You’ll learn to do that unconsciously eventually, and then you won’t need someone to set up an enchantment to do it for you anymore.”

“What if I wasn’t a Mage?” I asked.

“Well then I’d need to provide all the mana upfront, which would make it much more expensive. I’d need quite a bit of help, or a big sack of mana stones,” Nidab said.

“And immortality is simple,” I said wryly, looking at Nidab.

“Yes.”

“I still say that makes no sense. Thank you though.”

“You’re welcome.”

-----

It was getting a little late, and I could see the sun nearing the horizon. Waenne had come and gone, thanking me profusely for the substantial payment, promising that it would be put to good use. Then he was on his way in a hurry, I imagine that he didn’t want Cilla to get any ideas. Lili took me to dinner, or tried to. She tried to pay, but I insisted. I’d just been handed a not so small fortune after all, and she asked the questions that Waenne had said she would ask. I gave her the same answer that I’d given Waenne, and she seemed satisfied.

Lili led me to a rather nice inn, one where she seemed to know the owner, and a room was found for me that would accommodate my size. I set down my pack, and it reminded me of just how little I had. An oilskin tarp, a silk hammock, one pen, a multitool, a folding knife, my watch, two rings, a waterproof jacket, one pair of dark blue jeans, one dark blue shirt which was roughly mended, one pair of black socks, one pair underwear, and one pair of Gore-Tex shoes. I’d left the Adympian clothes in Waenne’s house, he could burn them for all I cared. It was a strange juxtaposition. The possessions looked like they belonged to the world’s most strangely prepared tramp, but they sat in the corner of a positively palatial room. It was every bit as nice as the bedroom I’d shared with Chypia.

“I’ll need to go clothes shopping tomorrow,” I said softly, looking over my things.

“Don’t worry,” Lili said, “I should be able to help you get acquainted. I’ll show you around to some of the clubs as well. I think that there’s a few that aren’t quite full yet, we’ll find a place for you.”

*That reminds me…*

“You mentioned someone named Brandy? Are there other humans here in Nimre?” I asked.

There was a knock on the door, just as she was about to answer, and I went to see who it was. It was a servant, bearing a tray with a teapot and two cups. I hadn’t ordered any tea, but I let her into the room. She set the tray on the coffee table, *tea table?* and poured steaming tea for both of us before bowing and leaving. I took a seat in an armchair, and Lili sprawled across a small sofa. Well, elf sized sofa. I was never really a tea person, but I sipped at it politely as Lili spoke, teacup dangling negligently from one hand.

“Brandy, she’s one of my students. She’s human, and I think there’s a family of humans that have caught the attention of King Nezzabi,” she explained.

“Caught the attention? In a bad way or a good way?” I asked.

“In a good way. I’m not sure just what he has them doing for him, but he seems to be thinking about handing off one of his duchies to be managed by them. Something about ‘Earth’ having more advanced technology.”

“Yeah, makes sense,” I said, “If I hadn’t discovered that I had magic then I’d probably have gone looking for some noble to share some Earth technology with.”

“And now?” She asked, “What are you planning to do with your human secrets?”

“Well,” I laughed, “I’m apparently teaching math to Djeta. Beyond that, I’m not sure. I imagine that this family you mentioned is going to try for most of the obvious stuff, gunpowder, penicillin, pasteurization of milk, germ theory, inoculation, maybe even vaccination, though that one is harder. I’ll probably end up making something silly like a magic typewriter.”

“Gunpowder?” she asked, interested.

Lili picked my brain for a couple of hours, asking about each of the things I’d mentioned, and I did my best to explain. Germ theory was apparently understood to some extent, at least within the university, though the rest seemed entirely new to her. She stayed quite late, late enough that I was a little unsure of just where this was going. I got the feeling that something was expected of me, but I had no idea what that might be, or even how to approach the situation in general. I wasn’t even sure I wanted a part in what Lili seemed to be waiting for. I always felt awkward in situations like this, and the fact that I really hadn’t gotten over my time in Chypia’s hands didn’t make things any easier for me.

Thankfully Lili seemed to get the idea after a while, and she let me know that she’d be here at nine tomorrow to keep showing me around. She left, and I sat and appreciated the silence.

*When was the last time I was able to sleep alone, in a proper bed, in a quiet room?*

I considered this, as I lay in a steaming hot bath. Not in Adympia, either Chypia had been in bed with me, or Aris had been laying in that silly little drawer. Not on the ship, that had been a hammock, and there were always at least a few people clomping around in the hall. Not in Myra, I slept with Thera every night, not that I’d minded too much. Not on the road, that was the hammock again, and Sila and the rest had been along with me. Harp’s snoring hadn’t helped. That left the valley, and while that had been a bed, it was not a ‘proper’ one. It had been quiet thankfully, and I’d been alone, but the bed was about a foot too short and the sheets were not anything like what I’d been used to sleeping on.

No, the last time I’d slept in a bed this nice, with no one to bother me, had been back home. *No, not back home, back on Earth.* The university was home now, and if someone had offered me the chance to go home, to replace my glasses, maybe even start the treatment that would have repaired the nerve damage to my hands…

If they’d offered that, I would have run screaming in the other direction.

*I’m here, to hell with everything else.*


# Chapter 25

Quinn

-----

I woke up the following morning feeling amazing. My hands were still useless, and my vision was still a mess, but I had true freedom for the first time in ages. It wasn’t as simple as not being a slave any more, though that definitely helped, true freedom came from the resources that I now had. Fifty two thousand drachm in the bank, with nearly two thousand more every month. The rich might spend money on a different scale than the average labourer, but 71 years’ worth of labourer’s wages had to count for something. On top of that, immortality was apparently less than a year away. For the first time in ages I could truly do as I pleased.

I got up early, which was a small miracle, and by the time Lili arrived I had already washed, shaved, and eaten.

The first order of business for the day would be to get some new clothes, and a school uniform. I liked the idea of new clothes, I liked the idea of a school uniform less.

“When exactly am I required to wear the uniform?” I asked, as we walked through the campus.

“Whenever you’re attending classes, though more of your instruction will be less formal since you’ve placed into the club stream, so you won’t actually be ‘in class’ quite as often as some of the less talented students. It’s not a ‘uniform’ though Quinn. They’re your school robes, and most students are **pleased** to finally be able to wear the robes of the university,” she said, a little reproachfully.

“They’re not a uniform, but they all share the same styling and the same colours, and they mark me as a member of the university. Sounds a lot like a uniform to me,” I said.

“It’s not all the same colours Quinn,” she assured me, “You have plenty of choice when it comes to colour, and maybe a little choice in the style. You must have noticed that not everyone was dressed exactly the same. I’m wearing my own university robes after all, and not everyone is wearing the exact same shade of blue as myself.”

I frowned, “Then… That doesn’t make any sense. How would anyone be able to tell a university mage from any other mage? If there’s so much choice then couldn’t I just declare to be the clothes I’m wearing now to be my mage robes?”

“Just let me get this straight,” she said, giving me a wry look, “First you balk at the thought of wearing a ‘uniform’ that many people less talented than you would give their left arm to be able to wear, and then you cry foul when I tell you that you have plenty of choice in just what sort of ‘uniform’ you wear?”

“Well, it just seems rather disorganized,” I said lamely, “What kind of military would tell their soldiers that they all need to wear this specific uniform, except they can each decide for themselves what colour that uniform is, and just how it looks. That’s no uniform at all.”

“It’s not a uniform at all Quinn!” She said, laughing.

“Fine,” I said, throwing up my hands, “How much choice do I have then, and what constraints do I need to abide by?”

“If there’s any at all,” I grumbled.

“Oh stop it you, there’s plenty of constraints. When it comes to colour you’ll have plenty of choice, though there will be a few that are off limits. Style you’ll have a lot less choice, for you it mostly comes down to just how much trim you want, and what colour you want it to be,” she explained.

“Why would some colours be off limits?” I asked.

“Purple, Indigo, Gold, Crimson, and Orange,” she listed, counting off on fingers, “They’re reserved for those with titles, or the relatives of those with titles. You’ll likely not be able to get robes in as dark a blue as your current attire for example. The trim is much the same, there are the same restrictions on colour, it’s more a matter of the amount of trim and other decorations that’s allowed on your robes.”

*So what, only royalty gets purple? I wonder if I’m descended from royalty… Well, go back far enough…*

“And my claim to those colours is not granted, purely based on the fact that I was the victim of a Banestorm?” I asked, putting just the hint of indignance into my words.

This seemed to give her pause, and she looked up at me, a little surprised, “You are from a noble family?”

“Of course, and depending on how the university’s sumptuary laws I might have the right to wear any or all of those colours,” I said.

*Sumptuary, see? I even know the right fancy words.*

“Well,” she said, considering this new information, “Only relatives of an imperial family may wear purple. Indigo is reserved for royal families, and gold for ducal families. Crimson for counts and their relatives, and orange for the families of barons. Of course, someone of higher rank may wear the colours of the ranks below, though they tend not to. We’ll need to have a bill of pedigree notarized for you though, we’ll do that first.”

“Of course,” I acknowledged, as if it only made sense.

*Bill of pedigree? I think that’s an item in D&D? Or is that a scroll of pedigree… Either way, it’s not like they can check my story.*

-----

“And the dynasty in question that you claim significant relation to?” Asked the notary, who had just lit an enchanted candle that would compel me to tell the truth.

*I kinda should have seen this coming.*

“The Carolingian dynasty”, I said.

“And you assert that the, uh, Carolingian dynasty, is an imperial dynasty?” He asked.

“Yes,” I said.

“And their claim to empire is on what grounds? The Carolingian empire consists of which kingdoms?”

*Consists of, not consisted of, damn. To hell with it, let’s see what happens.*

“The kingdoms in question would be West, Middle, and Eastern Francia, along with Lombardy,” I said, *I think I’m still okay here.*

It might have been a good thing that they were relying on magic for this, especially since it was **compelling** truth, rather than detecting falsehoods. I definitely felt some… weight, on my mind as I spoke. And I found myself changing the odd word just before speaking, but rather than catch me out as a liar, it was helping me along.

*If they were using a polygraph I’d be screwed, I can hear my freaking heartbeat right now.*

“Well this seems to be in order,” he said, he seemed as surprised as I was that I was getting away with this, ”Could you please describe your family’s coat of arms to the herald?”

*I’m really glad I Googled ‘Angove’ that one time.*

“Sure,” I said, as a young elf set a sketch pad on the table between myself and the notary, “A black eagle on a silver field, with a cross of black diamonds behind it. The mantling is black and maroon, and the helmet wears a gold crown.”

I watched as the young elf, some sort of apprentice I guessed, sketched out the Angove coat of arms. The helmet ended up looking a little flimsier than I remembered it being, and I had to correct him on the colour since it was steel rather than bronze, but he finished and I got my little piece of paper that told everyone what I was worth.

*Do I get to wear double-purple if I tell them about Emperor Caesar, Genghis Khan, and every other ‘imperial’ family that I can draw a probable link to?*

-----

Our next stop was a tailor, and while it didn’t have a fancy name like an English tailor might have, this was apparently the place where the well-to-do families would go to have bespoke robes made. It certainly felt a lot like an English tailor, or at least it looked a lot like the tailor from the Kingsman movie.

Lili was sitting in a chair, giggling like a little schoolgirl, as the proprietor, who was a gnome, tried to measure me. He was not having a lot of success.

He did his best to maintain an air of dignity as he dragged over a stepladder.

The small gnome summited the stepladder, taking his measurements, before beginning the perilous decent back to earth.

“This is certainly going to be the largest article I’ve ever worked on,” he said, bending over backwards to look up at me.

He had spoken formally throughout our conversation, though he wasn’t cold, and neither was he quite as stuffy as Abil had been. He was professional, he catered to the sort of clientele that expected that after all, but he seemed to genuinely enjoy his work. Unlike the few other gnomes I’d met so far Khory wasn’t the same reddish brown that reminded me of Prince Edward Island. Instead he was the same sort of dark brown, almost black, of fresh topsoil, though he had the same close cut hair and goatee of the other gnomes.

I shrugged, “There’s not a whole lot I can do about that,” I said, “Hopefully it won’t take too long?”

“Not too much longer, you need this quickly?” He asked.

“Oh I just need it in time for classes,” I said, “I assume I don’t need them sooner,” I asked, turning to look at Lili, who had finally gotten herself under control.

“You’ll be fine with normal clothes until then,” she said, nodding.

“Well there we are, have you got any samples I can look at for cut and colour then?” I asked, turning back to Khory.

“Certainly, just give me a moment and I’ll bring out some pieces that you might like the look of. Itys, would you see to our guests in the meantime please?”

Kory’s assistant, and the first female gnome I’d ever met, asked politely if we wanted any refreshments and Lili accepted a cup of tea while I settled for water and mourned the loss of my hot chocolate packets. Those had been destroyed the first time I’d taken an accidental swim.

“What is it that you don’t like uniforms about Quinn?” Lili asked, once the assistant retreated.

“Uniforms themselves are fine, I’ve got nothing against them. I just don’t like it when I’m expected to wear them. I don’t like the idea of anyone else deciding things for me.”

“Even something as simple as the clothes you wear?” She asked.

“Clothes are one of the most important things, exactly because they’re so simple. Even if you’re not wearing a uniform, your clothes still say a lot about you, they define you for the rest of the world. And if you’re wearing a uniform, then you’re defining yourself by your membership in the organization that the uniform belongs to.”

“But don’t you want to be a Mage? It seems to me like you half killed yourself to get here,” she said, leaning towards me and resting her chin in her hand.

“I do, I just don’t need the uniform to define me. Maybe I’m just being overly sensitive about it, but I’ve never liked it when anything or anyone gets to make my decisions for me. The society I’m from is very individualistic, maybe the most individualistic society that’s ever existed on my world, and even there, I’m probably an extreme case.”

“Extreme how Quinn?”

“Well, there’d always be extra curricular activities that I could sign up for at school for example. Sports, gaming clubs, that sort of thing. I never did like sports, but some of the gaming clubs always seemed interesting. So I’d try joining one. It would always go the same, I’d show up, have fun, meet people that shared my interests, and then after the second or third time I’d just stop going. Not because I wasn’t enjoying myself, but because I always hated that being part of the club meant that some time was not my own. Some time every week, or every two weeks, belonged to that club. It sounds foolish, I know, but it’s just the way I am.”

“I think I understand, somewhat,” she said, nodding.

“Thank you.”

“It’s not a uniform though.”

I threw up my hands in surrender, “Fine,” I said, laughing.

Khory came back and laid out several robes. All were far too small for me, but were a fairly good example of Khory’s craftsmanship. Khory waited patiently, giving me time to consider what he’d laid out. When Lili had said that higher ranking nobles were allowed more variety when it came to trim, it seemed that what she had really meant was that they were allowed a significantly higher amount of gaudiness. One set of purple robes had gold trim about as thick around as my wrist. It was far beyond ‘trim’, this looked more like someone had wrapped a gold fishing net around a purple silk poncho.

“I like how this one is cut,” I said, patting a slightly less ostentatious example of Khory’s work, ”Though the trim is still a little excessive for my tastes.”

I walked to one wall, where the robes that one might by ‘off-the-rack’ hung, “What I’d like is trim more like what’s on this one,” I said, pointing out one robe in particular.

“That one?” he asked, surprised, “That’s not very much at all.”

“Exactly, that’s exactly what I want. I prefer to go for understatement, rather than something as flashy as this,” I said, pointing back to purple and gold robes.

He nodded, considering, “I can certainly do that, would you still prefer gold, or did you have a different colour in mind?”

“Purple, as dark as you can make it, with the rest being indigo.”

“Pardon me, the trim will be purple, and the rest will be indigo?” He asked, looking between myself and Lili.

“Generally Quinn,” Lili started, “The ranking colour would be the more dominant one, to better show rank. Trim is usually reserved for a family colour, or a colour that the wearer particularly likes, if it’s not simply gold.”

*’Simply gold’*

“Yeah, but I like blue. I mean, look at what I’m wearing,” I said, waving a hand across my front, “The only thing not blue are my socks, and they’re black.”

“You’re just poking fun at the university’s rules for student attire, aren't you Quinn?” Lili asked.

“Maybe,” I said, grinning, “Hold on, there are specific rules then? Is there a big book somewhere where they’re all written down?”

“Yes, I have a copy of the university’s dress code,” Khory said, “Though it’s not quite that large, would you like to see it?”

“Yes please,”

“Itys?” Khory called.

“Yessir,” she replied, and I could hear her pulling open drawers and riffling around.

“You’re just looking for some rule to abuse, aren't you?” Lili asked me, and while she was sitting too far away for me to tell, she had to be giving me an exasperated look.

I just smiled, and took the small pamphlet from Itys when she brought it out.

There was some promising stuff here, though nothing really jumped out as being munchkinable. That was, until I got to the section on minimum length. It was defined in absolute, rather than relative terms.

“Alright, new plan Khor. I think I know exactly what I want,” I said, smile spreading.

Lili just leaned back, running both hands through her hair.

“That is always good to hear, what do you have in mind?” He asked.

“So the main colour is still indigo, and the trim still dark purple, but the cut will be rather different. Instead of falling to mid-calf or lower, it’s going to come down only as far as here,” I said, indicating my upper thigh area, “Only two pockets, and they’re be right about here,” I patted my stomach area, “And the trim will be two thin lines, just along the edges here,” I drew a line down the centre of my chest, “Oh, and it will need a hood.”

I was getting odd looks from both of them, though Khory’s was professionally odd.

“That’s not really a robe Quinn,” Lili said.

“I’m afraid I must agree with the professor,” Khory concurred.

“Maybe, but it’s within the dress code,” I said, “They say a robe needs to be at least this long, it’s at least this long. I’m only doing what I’m told.”

Lili sighed, leaning over the back of the chair, arms splayed out to either side, “I’m just glad that you’re not going to be **my** student.”

“It is rather clever though,” Khory said appreciatively, “This isn’t a look that anyone else will be able to achieve.”

“Thank you Khory, I’m glad that someone appreciates my genius.”

Khory and I took a little time to flesh out the details, and he sketched out a design for my final approval. I ordered five such sets of ‘robes’, with a two more full length sets for good measure.

*A silk hoodie. My school uniform is apparently now a silk hoodie. I’ve done something either very right, or very wrong.*

-----

“What’s next? Is there somewhere I can get normal clothes?” I asked, as we left Khory’s shop.

“No, we’ll need to find you a club first. You’ll need somewhere to put your things after all,” she explained.

“Wait, would I be living with these people?”

I was struck suddenly by the thought of living in what amounted to a magical frat house. I imagined a large townhouse, smelling faintly of beer and urine, and populated by bro-dudes with what amounted to superpowers. I never joined a frat when I was at U of T, I never felt the need for it. I know that for many people ‘Greek Life’ was an indispensable part of going to college, camaraderie, brotherhood, etcetera, etcetera, but that never really appealed to me. To me a frat meant partying, hazing, and the consumption of large volumes of alcohol. Crippling social anxiety meant that parties were more a burden than anything, hazing just reminded me of the less pleasant years of my time at school, and I very rarely drink.

*Don’t be so harsh Quinn, everyone here is either a Mage or a Wizard, that means that they’ll all be quiet bookish types like me, right?*

“It’s not a requirement Quinn, but most of the time the members of a club will all pitch in to rent or lease a floor in one of the buildings on campus. Why are you so reluctant Quinn? ” She asked, and I could just hear the edge of irritation creeping into her voice.

“I’m sorry Lili, I might be a little prejudiced. It’s not that I’m ungrateful, or that I hate how the university does things. You show me around, and I promise to shut up until I’ve actually got something to complain about.”

“Fine,” she said with a small smile, “But I’m going to hold you to that.”

-----

As it turned out, everyone at the university was not a quiet bookish type like myself.

According to Lili there were a grand total of thirty five clubs at the university, and we’d been through eight already.

“Now, why don’t you tell me what was wrong with those clubs?” She asked, as we left the square stone building that the Cro-Magnon inhabitants had called the ‘Cock Block’.

“Why do you think I had a problem with any of them?” I asked, a little defensively.

She gave me a pointed look, “Each time we stepped into one of the club’s apartments you got about as tense as a hunted animal, and you didn’t relax until after we’d finally left.”

It wasn’t that the people she’d introduced me to weren’t nice people, calling them all ‘magical bro-dudes’ was certainly too harsh. They were all polite and perfectly friendly as they introduced themselves, but they just weren’t the sort of people that I usually picked as friends. If they were back home they’d be the ‘trendy’ people. Though that didn’t mean that they were all assholes, often the opposite was true, and to say I was afraid of them was also incorrect. The tension came instead from the effort it took to appear ‘normal’, and it did take an effort. The parts of life that came naturally to most people were foreign to me. While most people would pick up on social cues immediately, or always know what the next thing to say was, I had no such natural instinct. That’s not to say that I couldn’t manage, I wasn’t a total head case, I could hold a conversation, even come off as charming, but I had to think about each and every word I was about to say before I spoke. I had to check and double check that I wasn’t about to put my foot in my mouth, and I had to take time to consider each and every person in the room. I’d look at their posture, their facial expressions, though that was harder now that my glasses were gone, and then take time to sort out just what their expression and stance meant. This was something that most people could do naturally, for me though, this had been something that I’d needed to learn, and even then I still made mistakes. I could manage this immense mental calculus when I was only talking to one other person without too much difficulty, even two wasn’t too hard, but in a large group I could barely keep track. It was easier once I got to know the group in question, but even then it could be hard to keep track of myself. I didn’t want to need to spend every waking hour ‘acting’ though, I much preferred a group, or a ‘club’ as Lili called it, that would take me as I am.

I sighed, “It’s not that I don’t appreciate your help Lili-“

“Quinn, I’m not offended, I genuinely want to know what’s bothering you. I don’t want to put you some place that will make you tense and unhappy, you might spend years with the people in your group. But you’ve got to help me help you. I’ve already been through nearly all of the top ten clubs, and you had the same frightened animal look when I was introducing you to each of them, even if you might have kept it hidden from the other students.”

“Top ten?” I asked, “Really?”

“Yes Quinn,” she said, laughing, “You’re smart, and very talented. You belong with the best, you’re just making it really difficult for me to **put** you with the best,” she said, grabbing me by the arm and shaking me, though she hadn’t quite stopped laughing.

“Well, maybe I’ve been too hasty, but there’s got to be more people like me in the top ten clubs. I mean, it’s only sensible.”

“Only sensible?” She asked wryly, “What do you mean, people like you?”

Now it was my turn to laugh, “Quiet, bookish types, that when they’re introduced to new people act like frightened animals. Not to be too arrogant, but someone who sits down and reads for fun has got to have better luck when it comes to magic, given equal talent. Just spending more time studying has got to count for something. Are you telling me that there are no other people like that in the whole university?”

She wrinkled her brow, “Of course there’s people like that Quinn, they’re just not all packed into one group. **They’re** usually happy to be put into any club at all, and put up with the fact that their club mates might be a little rowdy.”

“I get it, but you said that there’s thirty five of these groups. We’ve been through less than a quarter, aren’t there some that would be a little more… booky?”

“Actually we’ve been through half of the clubs, the other eighteen clubs are all specifically for women,” she explained.

“The clubs are segregated by gender? I suppose I didn’t notice any women in the clubs you’ve shown me so far,” I considered.

“It’s not a hard and fast rule, but the women led clubs don’t invite men to join. It’s hard enough to get a spot here if you’re a man, imagine how much harder it is for a woman.”

“And I bet that the male students, especially the noble ones, aren’t fans of having a woman boss them around,” I said, understanding.

“Exactly, so when a woman gets the chance to lead a club, she really only has other women to pick from. And, when a woman is looking for a club she tends not to pick one where she’ll end up placing herself under the power of a man. There were some… incidents, involving certain sons of nobles and merchants, and certain daughters of lesser nobles, or daughters of peasant families.”

“Basically some prick on a power trip decided to entertain himself with people that couldn’t properly defend themselves,” I said darkly.

*Sounds a lot like every sexual assault scandal I’ve ever heard about in the news. Giant asshole with power takes advantage of the women under him.*

“Yes,” she grimaced.

“What if…” I started, considering an idea, “What if it was the other way around?”

“What do you mean, the other way around?” She asked, giving me the side eye.

“I don’t have a problem with a woman as club leader. As long as I wouldn’t be committing some incredible faux pas, or being improper, could you find a group for me among the female half of the clubs?”

Her shoulders slumped, “Shit,” she said, under her breath.

“Uh…” This was the first time I’d heard her swear.

She straightened, and stepped infront of me, pointing a finger at my chest, “I’m going to take you to meet Victorina. You’re going to wait outside while I tell her about you. If she doesn’t like the sound of you, we leave, you don’t even walk in the door. If you meet her, and she still doesn’t like you, we leave immediately. If she talks to her club mates and they don’t like you, you also leave. And if you don’t like those rules then you can go looking for a club yourself, understand?”

I nodded, “Fair enough.”

# Chapter 26

Quinn

-----

“Alright, get in here,” Lili said, poking her head outside.

Victorina’s clubhouse was a fairly impressive building, nearly as large as the ‘Cock Block’ had been, and that building had been split between five different clubs. This building on the other hand was entirely the domain of Victorina’s club. While the Cock Block had been a large, grey, boxy structure, this building was more like a small manor. It was only three stories, compared to the other building’s five, but it was more spread out. It wasn’t huge, clubs apparently had an upper limit of twelve people, and this place looked like it could just about manage one bedroom per person if Victorina decided to fill her club to capacity.

Lili lead me inside, up the large sweeping stairs in the centre of the foyer, and along the balcony that overhung the first floor.  

“Just in here,” Lili said, pushing open a door that lead into a large kitchen.

It was fairly well appointed, and while it definitely had a medieval feeling, it was laid out much like a modern kitchen on earth. If I didn’t know better I’d say that the oven was electric, and one of the cabinets against one wall looked an awful lot like a fridge.

*Magic oven? Magic fridge?*

Leaning on a large kitchen island was a very generously proportioned elf. She had wide hips and broad shoulders, with a very ample bosom. Her purple robes were drawn in at the back to emphasize a rather narrow waist, and the dress was cut a little low in the front. Compared to Earth clothing it was still rather tame, but it was certainly provocative by the standards of Elardia. I couldn’t make out much of her facial features, even at this distance, but I found her hair was rather striking. It looked like fine steel wire, falling in waves down her back, it even had the metallic sheen of steel. It gave her a rather severe look, and it complemented the silver trim on her robes rather well.

*Purple, empressive.*

“Lili wasn’t exaggerating when she told me that you were a giant,” the steel haired woman said, extending a hand, “It’s nice to meet you, I’m Victorina.”

“I’m Quinn, uh, Lili?” I said, looking over at where she was leaning against the kitchen counter, before looking back to Victorina.

“I didn’t mention your hands Quinn, I thought that you’d rather do that yourself,” she explained.

*Damn.*

Victorina withdrew her hand, “Is there something the matter with your hands?” She asked, giving me the side eye.

I rested my elbows on the island between us, “Yeah, they don’t work. No feeling, and barely any movement.”

“That,” She started, “Sounds an awful lot like the damage done by Adympian slave manacles. Do you know a Mage by the name of Waenne? Most of the escaped slaves he helps have similar problems, he might know a spell that could help.”

“Well,” I said, wryly, “Funny thing…”

”Oh… I’m sorry.”

I just shrugged, “I can manage, I just cast Apportation a lot.”

“But… how could you have escaped? A Mage collar would have prevented you from even **thinking** too hard about escape.”

“They didn’t figure out that I was a Mage, so I just ended up as a steward. Still wasn’t much fun, so I escaped as soon as I could. I… I don’t really want to talk about it. I’m here now, and what’s over is over.”

“I understand,” she said quietly.

“I don’t mean to be rude, but do you?” I asked.

She was quiet for a moment, long enough that I thought she might not answer, but then she spoke, “Yeah. My father was, or is, Emperor Viuso.”

My eyes got really wide, and I blinked a lot as I considered what she’d just told me. *Emperor Viuso. Oh, he’s nobody important, just the Emperor of Adympia.*

We both stood there silently for a moment, leaning against the island, thinking our own private thoughts. I could see Lili edge backwards, just out of the corner of my eye, trying not to be intrusive.

“If you don’t mind me asking,” I started, “How did *you* escape, did someone manage to help y-“

“No!” She said, looking me in the eyes, and slapping a hand down on the table, “I didn’t have or need anyone’s help. I got out on my own.”

I raised my useless hands, “I’m sorry, I didn’t mean anything by it. I wasn’t in Adympia too long, but from what people have alluded to about the collars, especially what you just said, makes it sound like they’re pretty inescapable. At least if you don’t have help.”

*I wonder if Chypia has managed to free Concia yet?*

“I managed to escape before I was ever discovered to be a Mage, so I never had to deal with the collar,” she said, “Or the slave manacles,” she added, casting a glance at my hands.

“I’m still new to this whole magic thing, but isn’t magical ability determined at birth? Wouldn’t they have known what you were from the start?” I asked, keeping my voice soft.

“Yes, but you can’t get a reliable reading on a person until they hit puberty, at least the way the Adympians do it.”

“You mean how they check to see if you have mana?” I asked.

“Yeah, I’d already figured out what I was for myself, well before it came time for me to be checked for magical ability. So I left,” she said, lifting her face to meet my eyes.

“Hold on, you escaped Adympia when you were, what, twelve? And you had no help at all?” I asked, surprised, but also impressed as hell.

“Eleven. And yes, I did it all on my own.”

“Damn. Have you been here at the university since then?”

“Yeah, yeah I have. What about you, how did you escape?” she asked, for the second time now.

*Pretty sure she’s earned her answer.*

“I managed to get into my… captor’s, good graces. She gave me a little freedom to move about the city, to run errands for her, I was meant to be her steward after all-“

“She?” She asked, “Did she ever…” she started to say.

I just raised a hand, looking away for a moment.

*I don’t think I realized how much it got to me before, but now, putting it into words…*

“I assembled some things that I thought I might need on my way out of the country,” I continued, “and one night I slipped into the harbour, and swam around the sea wall. I’d bought myself a bit of a head start, and I managed to get far enough that by the time their search party had caught up with me I was already at the border. There was a little scuffle, but I managed to escape. Waenne found me the following day.”

“The following day- That’s why your hands are totally numb?” She asked, clearly surprised.

“Yeah, had them on nearly twenty four hours.”

“How did you manage to keep yourself going through all of that?” She asked.

“Honestly? No idea, I don’t remember most of it. I just woke up yesterday morning to find that Waenne had taken me in and gotten the cuffs off.”

“Wait, yesterday MORNING?” Victorina exclaimed, bolting up straight, slapping both hands on the island. She seemed almost angry for some reason.

“You’ve only been free for two days?” Lili shouted, also seeming angry with me.

I drew back from both of them, “Sorry?”

Lili calmed herself, “Quinn…” she sighed, putting her head in her hands, “And Waenne just let you out of bed? You should be resting!”

“Well, I kind of insisted. And I might have also bribed him.”

“You bribed someone to **not** take care of you?” Victorina asked, exasperated.

I shrugged, I was kind of lost here, “I wanted to get to the university.”

Victorina shook her head, laughing softly. She looked over at Lili, gesturing at me helplessly, “Is there anything else I need to know about?”

Lili looked up, and gave me a pointed look.

“Oh, right. I’m also half blind.”

“Are you serious?” Victorina asked, the humour in her voice lost.

I shrugged again, “My vision is very poor, even right now I can barely make out your facial features. And anything more than about a foot away starts to get more and more out of focus.”

“Is that normal for humans?”

“Kind of? Some humans don’t have very good vision, due to age, circumstances, or bad luck. I had glasses, they’re basically just lenses that would correct the flaws in my vision, but I lost them in the scuffle with the search party.”

Victorina looked towards Lili, “Is there anything you can do Lili?”

“I gave him a Hawk Vision amulet, I don’t really think it’s quite what he needs, but it’s the best I had to hand,” Lili said.

“I appreciate it Lili, it definitely helps. Really all I’d change would be to make the field of vision wider.”

“That shouldn’t be too hard to do,” said Victorina, frowning in thought and running a hand through her hair, “It will mean designing a new enchantment, but we’d have Hawk Vision to work from.”

“We? Does that mean…” I asked, a little hopefully.

“Yeah,” Victorina said softly, “I want to introduce you to the rest of the club before I promise anything, but I think you’ll fit in just fine. It’s not like you lack commitment, and that’s what we need if we’re going to compete with the other clubs.”

“You don’t have one of the guilds backing you up do you?” I asked.

“No, we don’t,” Victorina said, a little bitterly, “The university provides their own lab space, and we’ve got our own little library here, but it would be nice to have the resources that some of the other clubs have. I know that there’s a lab in the basement of the Cock Block that’s every bit as good as what the university makes available. And they don’t need to fight with every other student for access to it.”

*Maybe I can help out with that, it’s not like I don’t have the money.*

“Well, enough of that for now, let’s go see the rest of the team,” Victorina said, changing the subject.

Victorina led Lili and I to a large sitting room at the back of the manor. It had large arched windows running along the back wall, and I could see a set of French doors that led to a balcony jutting out from the rear of the building. There were five women sitting, sprawled, and curled up on various armchairs and sofas that sat in the room, facing in towards a large coffee table.

“You’re just making fun of us Brandy, there’s no way that yoga pants are something human women really wear outside, I can see practically everything right now,” A plush, brass haired elf was saying, as she gestured at the legs of one of her friends.

He friend looked fairly human, long blonde hair, build on the same scale as Victorina, and she was wearing black yoga pants and a grey hoodie.

“They’re called yoga pants Ken, yoga pants. And they are super-duper comfy.”

The one that Brandy had called Ken seemed to notice me, and started waving her fingers in my direction, “Brandy!” she said, hunching down a little.

Brandy looked over at me, flicking her hair over her shoulder, “What? Oh, hi there,” she said brightly.

She hopped up, rather excitedly, and grabbed hold of my, hand shaking it, “It is super great to meet another human, I’m Brandy, what’s your name?”

“Uh, hi. I’m Quinn,” I said, glancing down at my numb hand, still held firmly in her grip.

I could see that she was tall for a woman, now that she was standing up, though that still meant she only came up to about my shoulder.

She dragged me forwards by the arm, “This is Kennocha, but everyone calls her Ken,” she said, gesturing to the elf she’d been arguing with.

Ken wore orange mage robes, though hers were cut much more loosely than Victorina’s were, and they were decorated with white trim. I was, rather guiltily, reminded of an orange creamsicle.

“This is Minki,” she continued, pointing to an absolutely tiny little elf, smaller even than Chypia was, curled up in a chair clutching a book to her chest. She had a mop of grey hair, and wore brown robes with gold trim. Like Ken’s, her robes were cut rather loosely, but from what I could see of the bits of her that poked out of her robes she was rather slim.

“She’s really quiet but she’s also super awesome to talk to if you need help with magic stuff, and this is Halea, who is a super awesome battlemage.”

Halea was sitting next to Ken, her arm propped on the armrest of the sofa, resting her chin in her hand. She reminded me a lot of Thera, just a little bit… darker. She had the same generous build, though her long hair was black instead of silver, and her eyes were violet instead of lavender.  The similarities ended at the clothes though, Thera wouldn’t have been allowed the gold robes that Halea wore, though she probably would have chosen a similar design. Except for the colours Halea’s robes matched Victorina’s, closely cut at the waist, and with a lower neckline.

“Finally,” she said, indicating a quite stocky woman, who must have been a dwarf, “This is Neferoy.”

The dwarf woman was even shorter than the rest of the group, with the possible exception of Minki, and while she didn’t have a beard, she did have her brown hair gathered in two braids that fell down her back. She didn’t seem to share the noble birth of the rest of her friends though, and instead wore simple grey mage robes that lacked any trim at all.

“Thanks, um,” I said rather stiffly, leaning slightly away from Brandy, very gently trying to get my arm out of her grip.

“Oh, sorry,” she said, releasing me.

I tried to keep my awkwardness at being pulled into the centre of the room from showing, but I got the impression that I wasn’t doing very well. I looked towards Lili for support, and saw her looking up at Victorina, smiling.

“See, it’s just like I told you, he won’t be any trouble at all,” Lili said.

“Hey! I can be plenty of trouble, weren’t you just saying how you were glad that I wasn’t going to be one of your students?”

“Well, I suppose that hope is dead now, but I suppose I can put up with you,” she said teasingly.

“Is Quinn going to join our club then?” Minki asked, in a voice that was almost a whisper.

“As long as everyone is okay with it, yes,” Victorina said.

“I don’t mind,” Minki said, her voice even quieter, if that was possible.

“Totally yes,” Brandy said, “He is like the sweetest little nerdy boy ever.”

*Good?*

“If you’re alright with him then I’m alright with him Vicky,” Neferoy said, and while she had a deep rumbly voice, she unfortunately didn’t speak in a Scottish accent.

“It’ll be fun, we never have guys over to the clubhouse, he’s even pretty cute,” Halea said, “and he’s even blushing! He’s perfect Vic.”

I could feel the heat in my face as I sat down awkwardly in the nearest empty armchair.

“Are you sure Vicky? I thought we started this club so we **wouldn’t** have any men bossing us around, no offense Quinn. It’s just we’ve worked really hard for this,” Kennocha said.

“None taken,” I said raising my hands, “I get it.”

“Besides,” Victorina added with a smile, “I’ll be the one bossing **him** around, I hope you don’t have a problem with that Quinn.”

I was about to answer, but I was interrupted by a familiarly sexy voice, “Quinn doesn’t mind having a woman on top.”

-----

My head snapped towards the door, “Thera?”

And there she was standing in the doorway, one hand resting on the frame. I couldn’t quite place it, but she looked better than the last time I’d seen her. She had some new clothes, not mage robes mind you, and they seemed to fit her better than what I’d last seen her in. She still seemed to favour pink, and she kept her hair up in a bun, just like when I’d first met her. She wore a thick leather apron over her close fit dress, and I could just make out the gleam of metal poking out of the pockets along the bottom. The apron seemed to be stained with something, and there was a smudge of something greenish on her forehead.

“Yeah, hi there Quinn,” she said, losing the dusky tone, and dipping her head a little.

“You two know each other?” Victorina said, clearly interested.

“Yeah, I was the one who found Quinn a ship to Nimre,” Thera said, not quite meeting my eyes.

“But Quinn-“ Victorina started, “Oh,” and the rest of the group seemed to pick something up from Victorina’s expression.

“Yeah,” Thera nodded.

“Wait, you mean?” Kennocha started, and there were similar mumblings of realization from the rest of the group.

I rubbed at my forehead with the back of one useless hand, “I really don’t want to talk about it. It’s not that interesting, and I’m here now, that’s all that matters.”

“If,” Kennocha started, “If that’s what you want Quinn.”

Even with my poor vision I could see the sympathetic and piteous looks I was getting, and that was the last thing I wanted.

“Excuse me,” I said, rising, “I just want to talk to Thera for a moment.”

Thera joined me just outside the small sitting room, and I shut the door behind us. There was an awkward moment, as I looked down at Thera, and she stood there hugging herself. Then she had her arms around me, and was crying into my chest. I slipped my arms around her gently, doing my best despite the numbness, to stroke her back gently. She calmed down after a moment, but didn’t pull away, and instead she stayed there leaning against my chest.

“I’m so so so so sorry Quinn. It was all my fault, I’m so sorry,” she said, and I could hear her hold back more tears.

“It wasn’t your fault Thera, you couldn’t have known,” I soothed, still stroking her back gently.

“I was the one who picked the captain, I should have known better Quinn. I should have thought more about the risks you’d be taking. And when I found out, oh Verrin I am such a coward.”

“Thera…” I started.

“I met Sila you know,” she interrupted, “She caught the same ship as I did. She was easy to pick out, I saw her wearing the bracelet I’d given you. So I made friends with her, there were a couple other passengers on the ship, but we were the only two women so we stuck together. Her father mostly left us girls alone. I didn’t tell her that I knew you at first, I just asked her where she was going and why. I barely even needed to prompt her, she really likes you, you know. I was going to tell her that I’d met you as well, but the more she talked about you… She really likes you Quinn. We got here a couple of weeks ago, and I think we both went looking for you as soon as we were settled. Well I found Enutur, and I found out what happened to you. I couldn’t even face her after that, I’ve been avoiding her the whole time I’ve been here. I am so so sorry Quinn. I’m sorry for everything I put you through.”

“It’s alright Thera. It’s not your fault, and I can’t blame you for keeping away from Sila. I’ll track her down, I’ll tell her myself. At least this way she doesn’t need to spend any time worrying about what’s happened to me,” I said, holding her gently.

“What did happen to you Quinn?” She asked quietly, “You lost your glasses along the way, didn’t you.”

“Yeah, the rest… the rest I don’t really want to talk about Thera.”

“Do you need someone to, um, maybe take care of you a little?” She said, looking up to meet my eyes for the first time.

“Thera,” I started, wiping her tears away with the corner of one sleeve, “If I’d been here waiting for you when you went looking, if I’d not ended up in Adympia, would you still be asking me that? I thought you said we were done?”

“I know but-“

“Hey, it’s all right Thera. You don’t have anything to make up to me, and you were right to make that decision. It’s no good to tie yourself to someone else when you’re trying to start a new life for yourself. Take your time to find someone of your own, don’t stick with me out of guilt.”

“Hmpff, not just guilt,” she said, grabbing me rather firmly between the legs.

I batted her hand away, “Well, I guess you’re not feeling so bad about it now,” I said, grinning, “But don’t start something you can’t finish.”

She glanced away for a moment, “I’m still sorry Quinn. I still feel at least a little responsible”

“It’s alright Thera, I guess that’s natural, just don’t beat yourself up about it,” I said, and she nodded without speaking, “Why don’t you tell me how you ended up here. I didn’t think you were a Mage.”

Thera leaned back against my chest, and while I supported her decision to get a fresh start, I appreciated the honest affection.

“Well you got me interested in what you could do with magic,” she said, voice a little husky, “Really interested actually.”

“I noticed, you were **very** vocal about it, as I recall.”

“Hmm, well, I knew I couldn’t do magic, but it turns out that alchemy is the next best thing. It’s expensive though, more expensive than taking courses in stewardship or something else that’s really boring, and almost expensive as the university is for Wizards. You gave me a whole lot of money but-“

“Actually, for the record, I was swindled. Don’t forget that, you tricked me out of it fair and square.”

She thumped me on the chest, “**But** it wasn’t quite enough if I wanted to learn alchemy. So I went poking around a little, eventually I ran into Victorina. Now the club’s paying tuition, and I get to live here, just as long as I keep my grades up and do alchemy stuff for the club when they need it. I’m not officially a member since I’m just an alchemist, but it’s close enough, and they all treat me just like one of them.”

“Ahh, so you’re an alchemist then?”

“Yup, it’s pretty great. I might not have magic, but I can make it,” she said, smiling from ear to ear.

“It’s good to see you doing so well Thera.”

“Thanks Quinn, really, thank you. I wouldn’t have had the money to travel here in the first place if-“ She saw my pointed look, “If I hadn’t swindled you out of your hard earned drachm, and I wouldn’t have gone after alchemy with such a passion if you hadn’t turned me on to magic.”

“Ha! Turned on is right,” I said, and I might have just… tickled, her a little, with just the tip of one of my manipulators.

She thumped me hard on the chest, “Now don’t **you** start something you can’t finish.”

“Speaking of being turned on,” I started, “Can you make love potions with alchemy?” I asked.

“Why? Have someone in mind?” She teased, “But no, not really. There’s potions that can make someone extremely susceptible to suggestion, or much more docile, but that’s not really the same thing. I don’t know how to make either of those though, not yet. I **do** know how to brew a potion that will make the person who drinks it absolutely extremely horny, but that’s not really the same thing either.”

“The way you talk about that last one makes it sound like you have some personal experience with that one,” I said wryly.

She giggled, “One of my classmates, we absolutely hated each other at first, put some in my drink. They seemed to think that this would make me throw myself at the first warm body that crossed my path. And, well maybe I would normally,” she said, giggling again, “But I was patient. Someone taught me a little something about deferred gratification. So I brewed some of my own. And I put some in their drink.”

“Oh, and how did that go?” I asked.

*I think I like Thera’s stories.*

“I dragged her out of the party once they started to feel the effects of the potion. Thankfully her chambers weren’t too far away.”

“Sounds like you had some-- Wait, her?”

# Chapter 27

Quinn

-----

I got a questioning look from Victorina as I came back into the sitting room, “She’s just going to put away her alchemy things, she’ll be back in a bit,’ I explained.

*Hopefully Victorina’s explained my eyes and hands to the others while Thera and I were talking. I’m really getting tired of doing it myself.*

I’d just seated myself in one of the armchairs when Kennocha asked, “Would you like some tea Quinn?”

“No thanks,” I said, as she filled several teacups for the others, “I’ve never really been a tea person.”

“Ohmygod,” said Brandy, both hands on top of her head, “I know exactly what you mean, I haven’t had coffee in like, a year, you have no idea how much I’m suffering here.”

“Trust me, we know. You’ve been telling us every chance you’ve gotten,” said Halea, who reminded me very much of Yennifer from the Witcher series.

“Well it’s not my fault that no one in Elardia grows coffee beans,” Brandy said, accepting a teacup from Kennocha.

“Most of Elardia seems too far north for it to be possible,” I provided, “Nimre seems sort of like the north of France, south of England, when it comes to climate. Even Rhona and Adympia, at least the bits on the coast, seem more or less Mediterranean. It’s all too far north, and I don’t know if people travel far enough from the coast to discover any other continents,” I looked over at Victorina, “Unless I just haven’t heard anything yet, I’ve not been in Elardia that long.”

She shook her head, “Brandy told us about someone named Christopher Columbus, but I don’t think any elves have tried anything like his voyage.”

“Maybe there’s just not anything else,” Brandy said, “It’s not like we’re on Earth after all.”

“Maybe, but it seems unlikely. Adympia is about the size of modern Russia, so Elardia as a whole is probably about the size of Eurasia. If this planet is the same size as Earth, which it should be, then Elardia only covers about ten percent of the surface area of the planet. Earth is about thirty percent land, so we’ve got about ten percent unaccounted for,” I explained.

“Why should Kur be anything like Earth?” Victorina asked, and damn, that was a very good question, “Maybe Earth is bigger?”

“Well… Gravity seems about the same, and I’m guessing that Kur is made of the same stuff as Earth, which means it’s got the same density. If density and gravity are the same, then the size of the planet has got to be about the same size.”

“Gravity? What’s gravity?” Victorina asked, *Right, no Sir Isaac Newton.*

“Well…” *This is going to take some explaining.*

------

To my delight Victorina and the rest of her club mates, with the possible exception of Brandy, seemed genuinely interested in what I had to teach them. *I guess they’re my club mates now.* They all had interesting and intelligent questions to ask, and they tested the limits of what I could remember from school. Gravity turned out to be one hell of a rabbit hole, since to explain gravity I had to explain more basic physics, and to explain more basic physics I had to explain math, and to explain math I had to explain decimal numbers.

Kennocha and I had dragged in a large wheeled chalkboard from another room, and aside from Brandy who’d stayed curled up on the couch, the rest of us were standing around the chalkboard as I tried to pack elementary, middle school, and high school math into a few hours.

It was hard to tell with Brandy, but I got the sense that she was a little out of her element when it came to this sort of thing. Granted, she had probably learned all of this already, so it was entirely possible that I was simply boring her. Minki was quiet as well, though she still crowded around the chalkboard with the rest of us. The one who really monopolized my attention was Neferoy, particularly once I was done explaining math and we’d gotten on to physics. Some stuff I had to reassemble from memory and Neferoy in particular was usually able to see the connection that I was missing when trying to put an equation back together. By the time we were finally interrupted by a knock at the front door, the chalk board was absolutely covered in physics equations. I’d even sketched out Ohm’s law in the corner, though electricity would take hours of its own to explain.

“Oh, I’ll get it,” said Kennocha, brushing chalk dust from the front of her robes.

“Actually that’s probably for me,” Lili said, “I almost forgot about my appointment with the rest of the admittance committee,” she stopped suddenly, and turned to face me, “Right! We still need to get you some clothes, and there are some books we’ll need to pick up for you.”

“Go to your meeting,” Victorina said, waving her away, “I can take Quinn around to get the rest of what he needs.”

“Alright,” Lili said, “You’d better behave yourself Quinn.”

“I’ll be a perfect gentleman,” I responded airily.

Lili left, and Victorina went off to get her coat. It had started to rain at some point during my crash course in mathematics, reinforcing my belief that Nimre was roughly equivalent to the UK when it came to weather. It was certainly better than Adympia or Rhona had been. I had never been very fond of hot weather, and I particularly liked rainy days. My biking regimen had been a minimum of 60km every other day, and even in an absolute downpour I’d be out riding. The rain would keep most people indoors, which meant that I’d have the cycle paths to myself, and it would often keep the heat at bay. The way I figured it, I’d get wet either way. Soaked with sweat, or soaked with rain, I definitely preferred rain.

I was waiting by the front door when I realized that Thera hadn’t come back yet, and it had been at least a couple of hours since she’d left to go drop off her alchemy things.

*Shit, did I say something foolish when we were talking? Did I not say something?*

“Ready to go?” Victorina asked.

“Yeah, say, have you seen Thera?” I asked.

“Well her coat and shoes aren’t here, so she’s probably out running an errand. Did you say something to her…?” She trailed off.

“Maybe?” I said, unsure, “I don’t think so, but I’m not great at reading people, and it doesn’t help that I can barely make out people’s faces.”

She pushed open the door, and I was greeted with the sound and smell of the pouring rain. Victorina murmured a word, and as she stepped out into the street I saw a bubble form around her. It was as if she had an invisible umbrella shielding her from the rain, *in fact, that’s probably exactly what it is.* I followed her closely, keeping within the small field.

“Fancy,” I said, impressed, “Why bother with the coat though?”

“I don’t want some idiot to counter my spell and leave me soaked. The members of The Order of the Claves seem to think of themselves as absolutely hilarious, and dispelling Repel fields is one of their favourite ‘pranks’”

“Repel, what does it do?” I asked, it was about time that I did some magic learnin.

“Well if you put a whole lot of mana into it you can push back anything in the area. People, furniture, it’s even enough to redirect arrows or crossbow bolts if it’s being fed enough mana. You can overwhelm it by throwing enough things at it though, so it’s not a foolproof defence.”

“Enough things, does rain not count? Seems like that would take down a Repel field fairly quickly.”

“It does,” she said, “You can fiddle with the spell a little though, putting in more energy than you need and focusing it in only one direction, and that helps to stabilize it a bit. It still requires a lot of concentration though.”

“Ah,” I said, having figured it out, “It’s as much about showing off as it is about not getting wet, isn’t it?”

“Maybe,” she said, with a small smile.

“And that’s why some slightly jealous fellow students might feel inclined to try to dispel the field.”

“Yes, it’s also one of the only things that most people **can** dispel, specifically because it takes so much concentration to keep it together.”

“How does that work then? Would you have an equally hard time dispelling something of theirs?” I asked, Mage versus Mage conflict seemed like something that should be near the top of my priority list.

“To some extent yes, though I think we still have the edge there,” she was quiet for a moment, as she chose her next words carefully, “I can be fairly demanding Quinn, I’m not going to boss you around, or tell you what to do, but whatever you do… Well you need to be damn good at it. We used to have twelve members you know, and we were only six before today.”

“Did they leave on their own, or did you give them the boot?” I asked, trying to keep my tone fairly soft.

“They left on their own, I might have pushed them a little too hard… But dammit, it’s not enough to just be okay at this, Quinn. It’s not even enough to be very good, we’ve got to be the best. Of the ten clubs in the top ten right now, eight are men only. Only two are women only, er, well…”

“It’s fine, I can be an honorary woman. I already know how to cook and sew, there can’t be much else to being-- That’s a joke, this is me joking,” I said quickly, in response to the murderous look in her eyes, “I get it Victorina, I really do. You’re not going to break through the glass ceiling by acting all lady like.”

“Exactly,” she said forcefully, “We’re somewhere between third or fourth best, depending on how you rank the clubs. The only other woman only club in the top ten, is **in** tenth place. We’ve already had to fight like demons to get this far, and I’m not about to stop now… Were you serious about the cooking thing though?” She asked.

“Oh yeah, I think the magic stove is going to take some getting used to, but I could be convinced to cook dinner for the club once in a while.”

“I think I’ll hold you to that, we’d have a bit more money for new books and lab equipment if we didn’t eat out so much,” she said.

“Right, how much do you guys usually expect someone to pitch in?” I asked, it wasn’t like the university was being stingy with my bursaries.

“Well, usually about a third,” she said, in a way that made it sound like that wasn’t the whole story.

“How much do the rest of you **actually** pitch in?”

“Well, half. But you don’t need-“

“Its fine,” I said, “I’m happy to help. The university is giving me a hell of a lot of money anyway.”

“Thanks Quinn, it does help a lot. Property especially is expensive in the university, more of our funds than I care to admit go into the lease for the clubhouse. What is your level of talent anyway? If you don’t mind me asking.”

“I’m at the sixth level, how does that compare to the rest of the club anyway?”

“Sixth? That’s very good. Well aside from Neferoy and Brandy everyone else is also at the sixth level. Neferoy is at the fifth level, and Brandy is at the eighth level.”

“Eight level? Damn. And four sixth level Mages, there can’t be many more like that in the university.”

“There aren’t any more, at least not sixth level women. There’s another four men at the sixth level, but they’re not all in the same club,” Victorina said, clearly proud.

“I wouldn’t have guessed it, looking at Brandy, that she was so powerful. Though maybe that’s some of my own prejudices showing,” I said, feeling a little guilty at filing Brandy under ‘Valley Girl’.

Victorina sighed, “Brandy… I do wish she’d try a little harder. She only comes out about equal to us when she could be so much better, she uses her talent as more of a crutch than anything. Actually, that reminds me, do you know how much mana you have?”

“Well…” I trailed off.

“Is it none?” Victorina asked wryly.

“Maybe, is that a problem?” I asked, a little abashed.

“Not really, Brandy can mostly make up the difference with enervation, and that holds true with what I’ve heard about the other human at the university.”

*Wait, energy? Other human?*

“Uhh, what’s enervation, and what other human?” I asked, suddenly quite interested.

“You don’t know what enervation is? How are you casting your spells?” She asked, clearly confused.

“I manage with what I can do without using any mana, you’re telling me that I could cast spells with ‘enervation’ instead?”

“Who did you learn magic from?” She asked, brows coming together, “They should have told you all about enervation, mana, vitality, and soul.”

“What, not who,” I said, “I bought a book, ‘Introduction to Magic’ or something, can’t remember the exact title.”

“’An Introduction to Practical Magic’? Came with a mage stone?” Victorina asked, raising an eyebrow.

“Yeah, that’s the one. Hold on, didn’t Lili write it?”

“Yeah,” she said, rubbing at her forehead with one hand, “That was back when she first started teaching.”

“I’m guessing that there’s a story there?”

“Yeah, this was before the university was quite so proactive about finding new students. Especially female students,” she explained, “She wrote the book in a hurry, and copied it a couple of thousand times. The idea was to give little noble girls a chance to discover what they could really do. Magic is one of the only things that can really give a woman, especially a noble woman, self-determination. So if some princess buys the book with her stipend, and discovers just what she can do…”

“Maybe she doesn’t get sold like a piece of meat to secure some alliance with another noble house,” I finished.

“Exactly. Magic isn’t just the power to throw fireballs, or keep dry in the rain. It’s the power to say no.”

We were both quiet for a moment, then I spoke, “That was really well done, do you practice that?”

She laughed, elbowing me in the ribs, “Yeah, it’s part of my whole ‘welcome to the club’ speech. I try to headhunt the best Mages I can from the new arrivals, and sometimes I need to give prospective new members a little motivation. A lot of the noblewomen that come here just see it as something to impress a future husband with, like this is some sort of finishing school. That’s not the attitude I want from the women, er, people, in my club.”

“Headhunting, is that why you were so willing to accept me as a new member? Not that I’m complaining, but I was worried it would be a bit harder. Were you expecting me to have talent on the same scale as Brandy?”

“Honestly, yes. Both Brandy and the other human, Andrew I think, are at the eighth level of talent. They’re the only two at the eighth level in the whole university. I was hoping that all humans were like that, but I’m perfectly pleased with you being at the sixth level. It’s still something that we can’t get anywhere else, and it’s another thing that none of the other clubs can ever match.”

*I have a cousin named Andrew…*

“You mentioned something about enervation and mana though? Does Andrew also have no mana?” I really wanted to know if there was another way to cast spells.

“Ah, as far as I know, yes. But both Brandy and Andrew seem to have a wealth of enervation to draw upon, more than any elf, more even than an orc or giant. While mana is the energy of the mind, enervation is the energy of the body. There’s also vitality and soul, though those are both tied to the body,” she explained.

“And it’s possible to cast spells with any of those four? How would I do that? Shouldn’t I have already been able to do that without being told?” I asked, trying to work this out in my head.

“No, which is good, since aside from mana the other three are dangerous to use. Mana is inherently tied to magic. When you cast a spell you’re not the one providing all of the power to the spell. The rest comes from the mana that’s always surrounding us. It permeates the air, the ground, every object and person. The mana that the spellcaster provides is used to provide a form for this ambient mana. You can learn how to use any of the other energy sources fairly quickly, but you do have to **learn** them. It’s not something that comes naturally.”

“So, energy of the body, what does that really mean though? And what about the other two?”

“You use enervation whenever you lift something heavy, when you run, swim, jump or climb. It’s not quite the same when you use it for magic, it’s hard to quantify how much enervation you really use when you pick up a weight for example, but it’s about as close an explanation as I can give… You’re smiling like a child that’s just been given a new toy, why?”

“You said that Brandy and Andrew both have a wealth of enervation to draw upon? Well that seems to be fairly consistent with what I’ve figured out about the differences between humans and elves. Elves are much stronger for their size, but humans have considerably better endurance,” I began.

“That explains why humans have so much more enervation, but not your silly grin,” she said, looking at me under her brows.

“I don’t want to boast, well, that’s not true, I do want to boast. I’ve trained for exactly this. I’d originally been working up to an Ironman Triathlon, but this will do. Basically, the difference between yourself and Brandy, is probably about the same as the difference between Brandy and myself,” I said, more than a little prideful.

“Triathlon?” She asked, looking up at me.

“Swimming, biking, and running, all in one event. Oh, a bike is just a pedal powered, wheeled vehicle. An Ironman Triathlon is a particularly special Triathlon, two and a half miles swimming, one hundred and twelve on the bike, and then twenty six on foot. All in one day, all in under seventeen hours.”

“And you were going to do that voluntarily? Why?”

I shrugged, “To show how much better I am than everyone else?”

She nodded appreciatively, “Ah, that makes more sense.”

I laughed, “Alright, what about the other two then?”

“Vitality is what it sounds like, it’s what keeps you alive. Again, it’s not exactly a direct relationship, like enervation it’s rather fuzzily defined. The best comparison is that you lose enervation by picking things up, and you lose vitality by getting injured.”

“So, it’s blood magic then? Is that allowed?”

She tilted her head from side to side, “Well… It’s not quite blood magic. Blood magic usually means using someone else’s vitality and soul, and that is very much illegal. Using your own though is allowed, but dangerous. Use too much and you’ll just drop dead. You can recover it, but it’s much like recovering from a wound, it can take some time. Enervation is similar to some extent, draw upon it too much and you might collapse from exhaustion. Even if you only draw upon it a little, it will leave you winded, so it’s something to consider. Even using a large portion of your enervation, enough to be safe, can still make it hard to fight.”

“Sounds like I wouldn’t ever want to be using vitality to cast spells then, too easy to hurt myself as badly as whatever I’m trying to protect against.”

“You’re probably right in most cases, vitality is particularly potent though. Enervation is worth about as much as mana for casting spells, it’s more or less a one to one trade. Vitality to mana is more like five to one though, so it can be tempting to use.”

“Hmm, the trouble then is sorting out what your limits are. Might be worth it to use just a touch of vitality sometimes,” I said, moving to stroke my chin with one hand, before I realized the futility of trying it.

“That’s something we can sort out for you when we get back. The last type of energy is soul, and that’s the one that’s worth the most. It’s called soul, but it’s as tied to the body as enervation or vitality are, more so even. Soul is best described as years of your life,” she explained seriously.

“Damn, I’ve not got a whole lot of those compared to an elf,” I said, a little flippanty.

“Yes, Brandy mentioned that. It’s worth a great deal though, maybe more so for a human, though we’ve certainly not tested it. For an elf at least it’s about a thousand to one, when compared to mana.”

“So… Since immortality is apparently easy if you’re a Mage, I’m guessing that any Mage I **do** meet that’s old…”

“Yes, they’re either very foolish, or very deadly. Probably the latter, since a foolish Mage would end up dead, even with the sudden influx of energy that using soul will grant.”

“You mentioned Andrew, someone also mentioned that a family of humans were somewhere in the city. I think King Nezzabi took them in? Is he from the same family?”

“The Walsh family, yes.”

“Dammit!”

Victorina raised an eyebrow, “Is there a problem?”

“Andrew Walsh is my cousin.”

Victorina frowned, “And you’re not pleased? I would have thought that you’d be pleased for the chance to meet family, that otherwise you would have never seen again.”

I sighed, “I suppose they’re nice enough people, they’re just not **my** sort of people.”

“Do you want to go see them? We can get you your things after supper instead,” she offered.

“No, I’ll go see them eventually, just not right now.”

-----

Victorina and I arrived at a small clothier a short time later, and I got sorted for clothing. I had to get the clothes special made anyways, since I was larger than anyone else that was going to come through this little shop, so I had them cut to follow the pattern of the rest of my clothing. They didn’t have cotton or denim, but they managed to provide some decent alternatives. Soft, high quality linen for the shirts and tougher, canvas ‘jeans’. The canvas jeans were all to be dark blue, but for the shirts I ordered a few different colours.

“You’re an odd one Quinn,” Victorina said, as we were leaving.

“What do you mean?” I asked, *I’m pretty sure that Lili said something similar, just hours ago.*

“Half the time you’re as quiet as a mouse, and it seems almost like you want to curl up into a corner and hide, like when Lili first introduced you. The rest of the time you command the attention of the entire room, when you were teaching us all about math and physics. It was as if you were two entirely different people, not an hour apart.”

“Well it depends on the situation. I **am** pretty quiet most of the time, so when Brandy dragged me into the middle of the room I did feel pretty uncomfortable. But then you asked me about gravity, and gravity counts as science, and I really like science. Once you get me going on something I’m interested in, something I can speak knowledgeably on, well then you’ll have a hard time getting me to stop. It also helps when I’m in smaller groups, or if I’ve gotten to know the people well.”

Victorina nodded along as I explained just what the hell was wrong with me, and she seemed to at least have some idea of what I was talking about.

“Minki’s very similar, I think she’s said fewer than twelve words in your presence, but she’s one of the best people to ask when you need help with something magic related.”

We walked for a little while longer, heading off to one of the bookstores, enjoying the sound of the rain crashing against Victorina’s field spell. It was soothing, like rain against the windows of a car almost, but it had a soft quality to it. The spell didn’t quite create a solid barrier after all, and instead the sound came from the droplets of water meeting the opposing force of the barrier.

“I wanted to ask you about the club rankings,” I eventually said, breaking the silence, “You mentioned that we’re third or fourth, depending on how the ranking is done. How does that work?”

“Much of it comes down to the arena. There’s tournaments about once a month, and if you really want to you can find some sort of event to take part in almost every week. You can also rank the groups based on the talent of the members, or on how well they do on evaluations. We do quite well on the last two, very well actually. If you rank just on talent we’d be first place, if not for the five empty places. Evaluations as well, we do quite well, especially since it’s based off of an average, so it doesn’t matter that we’ve only got seven members. We do less well in the arena, especially since Minki doesn’t compete in the arena at all. We just don’t have the same advantages there, that the other clubs do.”

“What is it that we’re missing?” I asked, if it was combat spells then I had a pretty good idea for a modified Apportation spell.

“All the men at the university arrived with plenty of spells already known. They had tutors teaching them from the very beginning. As soon as they discovered their powers, their fathers provided everything they needed to excel. Having a mage in the family is an incredible boon. Daughters with magical talent aren’t quite so lucky. A son trained as a Mage is a powerful ally. A daughter trained as a Mage is a liability. Most noblemen will fear, correctly, that a daughter with magic will take the given opportunity to break free of their family’s control. So rather than teach them magic, most daughters with talent are married off at the earliest opportunity, with the hope that they produce sons with talent equal to theirs,” Victorina explained darkly, “It’s like we’re just breeding stock to them.”

“Is magical talent hereditary?” I asked.

“I honestly don’t know, and I expect that neither does anyone else. As far as I know, the offspring of a Mage is no more likely to be a Mage than if their parents had no talent at all.”

“How do any noble daughters end up at the university then? Seems like their fathers would make it rather difficult for them to learn any magic at all.”

“Trust me, they do. That’s why the only noblewomen you’re likely to see here are the ones with very high talent. Enough to be placed into a club, so four or higher. Peasant girls have it a lot easier when it comes to learning at the university. Actually, I think that at the lower levels of talent that there are slightly more women than men, though it’s roughly equal when you’re as talented as we are,” Victorina explained.

“Hold on, you need to be in the fourth level of talent or higher to place into a club? If there’s thirty five clubs, then… We’ve got to have a huge proportion of the more talented students then,” I realized.

“Yes, most clubs are made up almost entirely of fourth level Mages. No group other than ours has more than one Mage at the sixth level, and with you along we’ve got five. There’s also only a handful with even as many as two fifth level Mages. It’s the advantage in talent that allows us to hold on to our position. It helps compensate for the fact that aside from myself, the rest of the club has only been at the university for a few years, while the male clubs at least have had tutors since they were thirteen or so.”

“What is it that talent does exactly?” I asked, “I’m still not quite sure just what it means to have it.”

“Well it helps you learn spells more quickly, that’s the main reason for the segregation between high and low talent Mages. It also means that you have an easier time understanding the spell in the first place. It’s that understanding that lets you cast Apportation without investing any mana of your own for example, and it’s why you can cast the spell with only a few hand gest- Sorry,” she interrupted herself.

“It’s fine, I understand what you’re saying though, thanks.”

“Well with your degree of talent we shouldn’t have any trouble teaching you the spells you’ll need when the semester starts,” she said, moving on from her gaffe.

“Oh? And what spells will I need?” I asked.

“Just some foundational material, entry level spells in most of the schools, and we’ll need to make sure you know the basics of theory. None of it is nearly as complicated as what you were teaching us earlier.”

“I don’t suppose that there’s a big tournament in the arena to kick things off for the start of the semester?” I asked hopefully.

“Yes, though you won’t be expected to take part in that. I don’t know if we’ll even have time to teach you any fighting magic.”

“Well... I actually have some thoughts on that.”

# Chapter 28

Quinn

-----

Victorina took me to buy some of the books I’d need for the coming semester, and it turned out to be a surprisingly short list. There was some beginner reference material that I needed, mostly magical theory that I needed to read up on, but most texts were already present in the library at the clubhouse. The way that the university taught its classes would take some getting used to, but according to Victorina and Lili, most ‘classes’ would be taught by Lili herself. The thousand person lecture halls were reserved for the less talented, and those with more talent instead received small group instruction by either the professor assigned to their club, or a specialist on the area in question.

“How exactly would Lili teach me spells though?” I asked, as we stepped back out onto the rainy street.

Victorina gave me a questioning look, “What do you mean?”

“Well, don’t I need to memorize those symbols? Is Lili going to draw them on the chalkboard or something?”

“Oh,” Victorina said, understanding, “No, of course not. You’ll understand more about this once you’ve read these,” she said, nodding towards the small collection of books floating beside me, “But the symbols are one of the poorest ways to actually **learn** a spell. It’s much better to have someone else to teach you. Aside from having someone there to answer questions, and point out potential pitfalls, it also gives you a better grasp of the spell. Casting it becomes more natural, and energy manipulation is much easier. It’s generally quicker as well, and that’s not even including the time you probably took to test out each of the spells after learning them.”

“Well, it didn’t really take me that long in the first place. I think it was all of eight hours to learn Apportation for example.”

“Really?” she seemed actually impressed, “That’s not bad Quinn, but does it seem like being able to move objects around with your mind is something that you should be able to master in eight hours?”

“Well, when you put it like that, no. I’m guessing that the keyword there is ‘master’?” I asked.

“Yes, if you’d spent some more time with the spellbooks, you might have found that you learned a little more. Though, casting the spell repeatedly during your tests probably helped you get to the same place regardless. You should ask Minki about Apportation once we get back, I bet she has a thing or two to teach you. She can probably help you a lot with the energy manipulation, between that and casting from enervation, should make things easier on you,” she said, casting a glance at my hands.

“Thank you Victorina, really. I nearly killed myself to get here, and my only worry was that it wouldn’t be everything that I imagined. If anything, especially now that I’ve joined your team, it’s better than I ever imagined.”

-----

Victorina let me pick out a room for myself once we got back to the clubhouse, though they all looked essentially identical, and I set my books down by the bed. The bed which, thankfully, was plenty big enough for me to lay comfortably in.

“I’m surprised, isn’t this a little big for most elves? And it’s not like this is the only room scaled for someone my size,” I said, looking around. Even the furniture in the sitting room wouldn’t have been too out of place in a human’s living room.

“The whole clubhouse is like this, some now defunct merchant family with an abundance of Mages built the place to try to show off to the noble families. Of course, it turned out to be far too expensive, and it probably helped them along their way to bankruptcy. The Tanaka family took the building to cover some of their debts, and we lease it from them.”

“Isn’t it overkill? Not that I dislike it, I’d rather live here than in some big stone monolith like the Cock Block, but it seems like you’d save a lot of money by picking a smaller building.”

“You’re probably right, well, you **are** right,” she laughed, “I originally got the building to help attract better. Merchants and nobles are more discerning, and I hoped that they’d like this more than one of the little apartment buildings that most other clubs have a floor in. Peasants too, ask them if they’d like to live in a noble manor, and you might as well be offering them a fairy tale.”

“Fair enough,” I shrugged, “I’m not going to complain, I certainly like the place.”

-----

I followed Victorina back into the sitting room, to find that Thera had finally returned. Like the rest of the club, she was sitting on the floor by the coffee table, picking over a collection of items scattered over the surface of the table.

“What’s all this?” Victorina asked, peering over Thera to look down at the table.

“Oh, Quinn, you’re back,” Thera said, craning her head to look up at me, “I managed to get some of your things back.”

“So,” Brandy said, emphasizing the ‘o’ “You’re Canadian eh? How aboot that?”

I sighed. I could see the gleam of metal in her hand, and I guessed that she was holding my Canadian flag etched lighter, in fact they all had something of mine to investigate. Neferoy had the iron dagger and hatchet, along with my cheap Chinese multitool, and she seemed to be using some sort of spell to examine them. Kennocha was inspecting a shiny yellow loonie, and Halea was shining the big Maglite around the room, she seemed to be going out of her way to sweep the light across Kennocha’s face. Minki had the back of my phone pulled off, and was poking at the bits inside.

“Thanks Thera,” I said wryly.

I got a few guilty looks, and Minki hunched her shoulders, trying to seem small as she pushed the bits of my phone away.

“Sorry,” Neferoy said, in her rumbly voice, a little abashed, “It’s just that you’ve got so many interesting pieces here.”

“Its fine,” I said, waving one hand, “What were you casting on my tools anyway?”

“A metallurgical analysis spell, I was wondering what this was made of,” she said, lifting the multitool up, “Its iron, but there also seems to be a great deal of carbon in it as well. It seems to make it a great deal more resilient than pure iron.”

I sat down between her and Thera, and pulled my Leatherman out of my pocket, “Check this one out,” I said, smiling slightly.

Neferoy started casting the spell, and in the meantime, Thera picked up a bundle of cloth from her lap and handed it to me, “I managed to get this back as well.”

I picked it up, and shook it out. It was my hoodie, the dark blue one I’d been wearing when I’d first been dropped off by the Banestorm. I looked it over, and it seemed to be in pretty good shape. Better shape even than it had been when I’d lost it. I’d been worried before about wearing through the elbows, they were getting rather thin, and it had started to fray at the hem and the end of the sleeves. Now it looked brand new, and smelled like it had just been washed.

“Minki was the one who fixed it up, I hope that’s okay.”

“It’s great Thera, thanks. And thank you Minki,” I said, as I slipped into the hoodie. Just wearing it made me feel more comfortable.

“You’re welcome,” Minki said in her tiny voice.

“Quinn,” Neferoy said, alarmed, “This is amazing, I’ve never seen anything like this. The craftsmanship alone is incredible, but the quality of material is unlike anything I’ve ever seen.”

“You like it?” I asked.

“Yes-” she started.

“Keep it,” I said, and she blinked.

“Are you sure?” She asked.

“Yeah, I’ve still got the other one, and I really hope I’m not ever going to be in a position to need it again. If I find myself stumbling around the wilderness without magic again, then I’ve got bigger problems.”

“Thanks,” she said, and the multitool disappeared into her robes.

“How did you manage to get all this stuff back?” I asked, looking over at Thera.

“Enutur still had some of the stuff when I tracked him down, and I might have threatened to force feed him an emasculation potion if he didn’t give back everything he stole from you,” she said, looking down, but smiling evilly.

“An emasculation potion?” Halea laughed.

“Well I’d just started learning alchemy, so I was feeling a little inspired,” Thera said, “And as far as he knew I **could** brew an emasculation potion!”

“Is that really something that exists?” I asked, leaning slightly away from Thera.

Thera giggled, “Why Quinn? Are you worried?” And there were a chorus of giggles and “ohhs” from the rest of the girls.

I took a great interest in the table in front of me, and I could feel the heat as my face flushed.

“Oh don’t tease him Thera,” Victorina said, though she seemed to be enjoying my embarrassment.

“Oh it’s just so much fun. Get him alone and he’s such a flirt, but add just one more person and he falls apart,” she laughed, as she leaned back and clapped her hands together.

“**So Brandy, where are you from anyway?**” I asked forcefully, trying my hardest to change the subject.

“You’re sure you don’t want to talk about emasculation potions?” Brandy teased, “Hey, maybe there’s like, a re-masculation potion.”

“Oh, trust me. Quinn doesn’t need that, any bigger and it’ll feel like getting punched in the stomach,” Thera said, voice cracking as she tried to keep from laughing long enough to get her joke out.

I bowed my head, and did my best to cover my face with my numb hands.

“Oh you’re so precious,” Victorina said, “Lili was right, you’re basically harmless.”

I put my hands together, begging “Please Brandy-“

“Fine!” She said, relenting finally, “LA, in California. Where in Canada are you from?”

“Toronto,” I said, “What were you doing when you got picked up by the Banestorm? Where were you?”

“Oh my god,” Brandy said, “Well I’d just gotten ready for bed, and I was in my jammies, and there was this big thunderstorm outside. It was all freaky and green and stuff, so I was looking outside. Well there was this big flash of lightning, and when I could see stuff again I was standing in the middle of a forest getting rained on. It was super-duper cold, and I was getting really wet. Vicky was like, right there though, which was super great.”

“She was?” I asked, *that’s one hell of a coincidence.*

“I was,” Victorina said, “It’s not that hard to detect a Banestorm that’s about to form, so whenever one opens up close enough to the university, I try to be there. Sometimes nothing comes through, and sometimes someone else gets there first, like with the Walsh family. But I was the first one to get there when Brandy came through.”

“Yeah, she was right there and cast her umbrella spell, which was really nice. I didn’t have any stuff like this with me,” she said, gesturing at my things on the table, “Just my jammies. I don’t know what I would have done if Vicky didn’t find me. What about you? What were you doing when you got picked up?”

“My transition to Elardia was not very much fun, **I** was driving over an overpass when the storm hit,” I explained, “I came out of the Banestorm at about a hundred kilometers per hour, thirty feet off the ground, in the middle of a forest.”

“Oh my god, how are you not dead?” Brandy asked, covering her mouth.

“Luck?” I guessed, shrugging.

“What’s a kilometer?” Kennocha asked, looking between myself and Brandy, seeming both concerned and a little confused.

“One hundred kilometers per hour is about sixty miles an hour, or about a mile per minute,” I said.

This earned a round of sympathetic and concerned noises from the rest of the group, and Kennocha asked, “How were you going that fast? Wouldn’t you **die?**”

-----

It took some time to explain the concept of a car, and just how exactly it would keep me alive in a sixty mile an hour collision. We chatted for a bit after that, and I learned a little bit more about each of my club mates. Brandy in particular was an interesting case, I’d just assumed that she was from the same Earth as myself, but it turned out that I was quite mistaken. Brandy was from a version of Earth where the first world war had never happened. As someone who’d taken several history courses at the University of Toronto, I found this incredibly interesting. It wasn’t as simple as Gavrilo Princip not shooting Arch Duke Franz Ferdinand, that alone wouldn’t have prevented the First World War. There had to be so many more changes behind the scenes, Europe had been a powder keg prior to the war, and something else would have set it off if Gavrilo hadn’t. Brandy didn’t have many answers for me though. Her parents, who were apparently quite wealthy, had gotten her started with modeling straight out of high school. This mean that her historical knowledge was rather lacking. I did get some broad strokes though, at least about current affairs on her version of Earth. Without a First World War, none of the massive colonial empires fell. In Russia for example, the Czar was never rebelled against, and at some point in the past hundred years they’d transitioned into a constitutional monarchy. Japan’s royal family still seemed to hold a great degree of power, but if I’d pieced together the bits that Brandy had given me, it seemed as if they’d never entered the period of extreme nationalism that characterized Japan during the thirties and forties on earth. It was so frustrating, I wanted to know so much more. She gave me tiny little hints to a world that would be any history nerd’s dream, but could answer almost none of my questions, and she was the only person on the planet that would ever even come close.

I finished my interrogation eventually, and then it was my turn to get quizzed. I’d piqued the interest of the rest of the team with mention of various Earth royal families, and ‘world wars’, so I spent quite a while explaining Late Victorian to First World War history.

*I am surrounded by beautiful women who are, for some strange reason, interested in me nerding out about history. This might be the greatest day of my life. Oh, and I also have magic.*

We broke up our little history lesson after an hour or two, and Kennocha went off to order us some food. I followed Victorina’s advice, and went to find where Minki had run off to.

-----

Halea pointed me in the direction of the library, and just stepping into the room convinced me that Halea was 100% right to keep the lease on this building. It looked like every Victorian library I’d ever seen in movies or described in books. Bookshelves lined the walls and more were spaced evenly throughout the room. A balcony ringed the wall of the library, with a pair of small spiral staircases leading up to them, allowing access to a second set of bookshelves. The smell of paper and leather mixed with the smell of rain coming in through an open window, and the only sound was the crash of rain against the glass and the flagstones outside. Just standing on the threshold gave me goose bumps, *I’m definitely going to like it here.*

I didn’t see Minki right away, so I took some time exploring. I walked along, reading titles, and I only wished that I could feel the texture of paper and leather under my fingers. I found Minki in the far corner behind several shelves, sitting cross legged, hunched over a book. She seemed engrossed in her book, and didn’t notice me as I stepped around the corner.

“Hey,” I said quietly, “Mind if I join you?”

She looked up quickly, startled by my sudden intrusion, “Sure,” she said in her little voice.

I walked over, and sat down across from her, also sitting cross legged. Maybe I was overestimating the impression I made, but I’d been doing my best not to seem imposing since first arriving at Victorina’s clubhouse. Being one to two feet taller than most of the people around me did have its advantages in certain situations, but on the other hand I didn’t want to make anyone feel uncomfortable. Minki in particular was just shy of four and a half feet tall. I knew what it was like to feel uncomfortable in a group of people, and I didn’t want to be the reason for anyone else feeling like that.

“Victorina mentioned that you were the person to ask if I wanted help with Apportation. Do you mind giving me a hand? I can bother you some other time if you’re busy,” I said, keeping to a ‘library’ tone of voice.

“It’s fine,” she said, “Um, just a second.”

I saw her go through the motions of casting a spell, though I’m not sure what it was, and then she said, “Alright can you show me how you cast the spell please?”

“Sure,” I said, and then spoke the words to cast Apportation.

There must have been more going on, something that I couldn’t quite see, because I saw her eyes scanning the air around me. It was almost as if she were reading words or letters floating in the air before me. As far as I knew, that was exactly what I was doing. She had me cast the spell a few more times, and she eventually seemed to come to some sort of conclusion.

“You’re pretty good Quinn, how long did you spend learning the spell? You read it from Lili’s book right?” She asked, still in her little mousey voice.

“Eight or so hours?” I guessed, “Though I spent quite a bit more testing the limits of what I could do with the spell. I think Victorina mentioned that practical experience did help as well when it came to having a better grasp of the spell.”

“A little, yeah,” she said, “Though the main thing that actually casting the spell does for you is help you learn how to use the spell, not really how to cast it. Did you keep at the book even after you could cast it?”

“No, I started experimenting with it, pretty much right away,” I explained, “Is there more to be gained from the spellbook after learning how to cast it?”

“Yes, well. Insofar as the book helps at all. Trying to memorize symbols isn’t really a very good way of learning a spell. You seem to do it a little quicker than most, but even if you kept at it for weeks, you can’t get that much better with just a book to reference.”

“Well I guess that’s where you come in then? I take it that you’re pretty good at this sort of magic,” I said.

“Yeah, I guess,” she hedged.

“Best in the club?” I asked.

“Yeah,” she said, hunching up her shoulders, “It’s one of my specialties I guess, that and Knowledge-Meta magic type spells. It’s not as flashy as fire or air magic though. It’s not much good in the arena either.”

“For combat type applications?” I asked, and she nodded.

“I want to compete in the arena, I really do, it would help the club a lot. It’s just really scary, and none of the spells I know are any good for fighting,” she said, pulling her knees up to her chest.

“Isn’t the arena safe though?” I asked, “Waenne said that nothing that happens in there can really hurt you.”

“But it can hurt you, really a whole lot it hurts, it just isn’t permanent,” she said.

“Wait, so contestants still feel the pain of any injuries they receive?” I asked, raising my eyebrows.

“Yeah.”

“Oh, damn.”

That didn’t make things entirely unmanageable, but I guessed that taking a fireball in the face wasn’t a whole lot of fun, it was certainly one hell of an incentive to avoid getting hit.

“I want to create a whole new spell for fighting, building on what I know, but the Telekinesis college just isn’t a good one for combat magic. Most of the spells are more utility focused.”

“Well,” I said, grinning widely, “I might have just the solution we need. Tell you what, you help me learn Apportation and whatever the other Telekinesis spells I need, and then you and I design a brand new combat spell. Not an okay one, not a good one, the best. We’re going to create a combat spell that’s going to change the whole combat paradigm in the arena.”

“Really?” She asked,

*As long as what I’m thinking of wasn’t imagined, prototyped, created, and tested, hundreds of years ago. I really hope this is an original idea.*

“Yes.”

-----

Minki tutored me in Apportation for about half an hour before I heard Kennocha calling from the door to the library, “Quinn, Mini! The food is here!” And I saw Minki frown and furrow her brows.

“What is it Minki?” I asked.

“I don’t like being called Mini,” she said, a little petulantly.

I nodded, “Do you think anyone will mind if we eat in here?” I asked.

“As long as we eat at one of the tables Victorina won’t mind,” she answered, standing up.

“You find us a spot then,” I said, as I got to my feet, “I’ll go get our food.”

“Oh! Thanks Quinn,” she said, peering up at me.

-----

“Where’s Mini?” Kennocha asked, when I came into the kitchen.

Everyone was clustered around the island, which was littered with paper wrapped packages in little wicker baskets. I scooped up the largest and the smallest of the baskets, along with some utensils, and one of the bottles of the weak wine that seemed to be the usual drink to accompany dinner.

“Still in the library, we’re going to eat while she helps me with Apportation,” I explained.

“Make sure you eat-“ Victorina started, pointing at me with a fork.

“At one of the tables, don’t worry,” I finished.

-----

Minki was sitting in a chair, with her knees drawn up underneath her, at one of the solid wood tables near the back of the library. I set the smaller of the two baskets and some utensils in front of her, and I set my own food down across from her. I poured out a bit of the wine for each of us, and she continued her lesson on Apportation as we ate our fish and chips.

Minki was clearly skilled, Apportation was actually one of the spells she could cast with only a thought, her only difficulty with teaching was properly articulating the concepts in question. She did well enough though, and while I couldn’t get the spells off any more cheaply, I found that I could keep more copies of the spell active before I started to run into issues maintaining them all. She also taught me how to cast spells with enervation and vitality. Suddenly having access to so much more power was one hell of a kick-start, and I was nearly giddy with power. The average elf apparently had about ten mana, about five enervation, and about eight vitality. The average human had no mana, around ten enervation, and about ten vitality. My fellow club members were somewhere in the twelve to thirteen range when it came to mana, having spent some time on the magical equivalent to endurance training, and otherwise they matched up with the average elf. I still had no mana, but I was practically swimming in enervation and vitality, with about twenty enervation, and sixteen vitality. The numbers weren’t exact, they could vary by as many as two points depending on something as simple as what I had to eat in the morning, but the numbers were close enough. Spending either did include a physical impact, even using enervation would leave me winded, but it was manageable if it meant that I could actually **cast** spells.

I might have gotten a little carried away with my new found power, and I gave serious thought to jumping up on the table and riding it around like a hover board.

I managed to restrain myself thankfully, and settled for shuffling the furniture in the library around.

“That’s really good Quinn, there’s still some more for me to teach you over the next couple days, but this is a very good start,” Minki said. She’d relaxed a little once we’d spent a bit more time together, and was no longer speaking in her little mousey voice. She was still a quiet little woman, but she seemed more comfortable now.

“Thanks Minki, and thanks for all the help. Especially helping me get exact figures for enervation and vitality, trying to figure out the numbers by trial and error would be nearly impossible to do safely,” I said, though the last couple words turned into a yawn.

“It was no problem Quinn,” she said, “Come find me after breakfast tomorrow, I’ll probably be in my usual spot by the corner, and we can continue with Apportation.”

I stood up, a little unsteadily, and got a bit of a head rush.

“Are you going to be okay?” She asked, noticing me swoon a little.

“I’ll be fine,” I said, gathering up the remains of our meal.

Minki gently took the little wicker baskets from my hand, “You go to sleep, you look like you’re about to fall over, and there’s no way I’m going to be able to catch you.”

I let her, she was right, I did feel like I was about a second from passing out. I could recover enervation pretty quickly, faster than any elf could and faster than Brandy could as well, but it wasn’t as simple as filling a bar back up. Run or jog a kilometer, or do a set of weights, and while you can take time to rest, you’ll still be left more fatigued than if you’d not tired yourself out at all. And I hadn’t just done the equivalent of one or two sets of weights, I’d probably done a couple dozen sets of weights. Sure, I’d done it with magic, but I’d used enervation to do it.

I raised my hands, “You win, I’m going to go sleep for a year.”

“Goodnight Quinn.”

“Goodnight Minki.”

Quinn

-----

Minki and I spent the next week or so working on Apportation, and I got to the point where I could cast it at a twenty pound capacity without expending any energy of my own. According to Minki I was still about another week from really ‘knowing’ the spell, but I could certainly cast it quite well.

“Hold on though,” I said, during lunch on the last day of tutoring that week, “What about someone that’s not as talented? What about all the lower talent Mages and Wizards? If it takes me two weeks to ‘know’ a spell, then how long is it going to take one of them, if it takes a couple of weeks for someone as talented as me to learn the spell?”

“Well, it depends on what you mean when you say that you’ve ‘learned’ a spell. There’s the point where you can cast it, and that doesn’t take too long at all,” she said, before taking another bite of noodles.

“Sure, that usually only takes me a day or two with just the book for reference,” I agreed.

“Right, and it would probably be a little less than a day if you’ve got someone to teach you. Then there’s the point where you really understand all of the magical theory. For someone as talented as you or I, that usually takes two weeks. For someone talented enough to be in the club stream, those are really the only milestones we need to judge ourselves on.”

“What about casting the spell without as much energy, or even none? I mean, I can cast Apportation for free, up to a certain limit. I could even do that before you started tutoring me on the theory. Where does that fit in?” I asked.

“For someone less talented they probably would need to learn more of the theory to be able to better manipulate the mana involved, but that’s exactly what ‘talent’ is,” she explained, between mouthfuls of noodles, “We still need to learn the spells in the first place, but it comes much more naturally to us. We don’t need someone to tell us how to shape the energies involved, it’s something that we do without even thinking about it.”

“So what about less fortunate Mages then?”

“Well less fortunate Mages also need to worry about the spell actually working when they cast it,” Minki said, sounding almost sympathetic, “And that’s the milestone that Wizard and Mages in the lecture stream need to worry about.”

“What do you mean?” I asked.

“It takes you or me a day or a little less to know a spell well enough to attempt to cast it, and since we’re so talented that’s usually enough. For the less talented though it can take as many as three days for them to even attempt the spell, and even then, they’ll probably not be able to hold the spell together when they do try it. Learning the theory behind the spell will help, but learning the theory could take as many as five weeks, and even then the spell will probably fail about half the time when they try to cast it.”

“So…” I started, trying to get things straight in my head.

*Damn, five weeks to learn Apportation, and then still not really being able to cast it?*

Minki seemed to recognize my confusion, so she summarized for me, setting aside the remains of her meal “Just *attempting* the spell is the first milestone, that takes us a day or less, but three days for most Mages. Understanding the theory is the second, and that takes a couple of weeks for us, or five weeks for most Mages. Being able to cast the spell reliably, under stress, is the next milestone. That’s where a Mage or Wizard is considered ‘competent’ with a spell, and takes most Mages another three to five months.”

“Months?” I asked, a little incredulously.

“Yes, and that’s what sets us apart. We don’t need to spend all that time studying one specific spell to be able to cast it without any trouble, we can do that right away. After that, the last milestone that really matters is knowing the spell well enough to be able to draw some or all of the energy for it directly from ambient mana. This is where a Mage or Wizard is considered ‘proficient’ with a spell. And for most Mages as talented as us, we’re already considered proficient as soon as we can cast the spell.”

“So basically, we skip right to the end, and need to back track to learn the theory.”

“Yes, but for most Mages, learning the theory is a fundamental requirement to even be able to cast the spell. To do what we do and just pull mana out of thin air, well, that could take some Mages a whole year of constant study. And that’s just for one spell,” she explained.

“What about casting with just a thought?” I asked, “That’s something you can do with Apportation isn’t it?”

She nodded, “I can, yes. But it’s not something that’s as well understood. The university’s been here a very long time, we know how to accurately gauge someone’s talent, and we know about how long it takes to teach differently talented Mages. Casting a spell naturally, that’s what it’s called when you don’t need gestures or words, isn’t quite so well understood. Even I don’t really understand, and I can do it. I wouldn’t even know how to begin to teach it, sorry,” she said quietly.

“It’s alright Minki, you’ve already done plenty to help me. It’s only fair that I sort some things out for myself. Would this also be something that we’ve got an advantage on?” I asked.

“No, actually. This is the one thing that less talented Mages seem to have more luck with. I’m not sure why, but my best guess is that they just spend so much more time with each spell. There is something to be said for such in depth study I suppose,” she said, curling up in the chair.

“I guess we still need to work hard for some things at least,” I said, leaning back comfortably, “There’s some resentment between high and low talent Mages, isn’t there,” I asked.

“Yes,” she said softly, “Not that I can really blame them. You or I sit down with a little pamphlet of a book, spend seven or eight hours studying, and we can cast the spell well enough that we can probably use it in the Arena. But for someone less talented it might take them months to reach that point. It doesn’t help that some of us, especially the nobles, like to try to set us apart even more. They’ll call themselves ‘Maguses’ or ‘Magi’ or something else impressive sounding. They argue that the difference between us and most Mages, is larger than the difference between most Mages and Wizards. They’re right I guess, but it just all seems like one more way for nobles to try to make themselves seem better than everyone else.”

“You’re noble aren’t you, you’ve got some gold on your robes,” I said, nodding towards her.

“Yes, but that doesn’t mean I need to browbeat everyone with my rank so they’ll pay attention to me. Mostly I just want to be left alone so I can hide in the library and read my books and learn new spells.”

I laughed, “I can certainly understand that.”

-----

I went out alone after we finished lunch. Minki had said that she didn’t mind continuing, but I’d been monopolizing her time all week and it only seemed fair to give both of us a break. Besides, I had to see about getting a modified Hawk Vision amulet. I’d experimented with a few other solutions, but they hadn’t really panned out. The first thing I’d tried was to make an illusory copy of my, now lost and broken, glasses. In theory, this worked great. In practice, it was terrible. I could make the glasses, I could even see through them properly. The lenses worked after all, whether it was an illusion or not, the glasses did bend the light properly. The problem I had, was the same problem that I’d had from the start with illusions, and that problem was that moving the illusion around was an absolute bitch. Even with such a tiny illusion, I could either move myself, or move the illusion, and doing much more was an ordeal. It was hard enough to keep the glasses in position as I moved my head around, and I could just about use them to read, but then I didn’t need glasses to read. What I needed glasses for was distance, which meant I didn’t really need them while inside and sitting down. I needed glasses for when I was outside and walking around, and accurately moving an illusion while walking was still beyond me. Kennocha was apparently the person to talk to if I needed help with Illusion, Light, or Sound magic, but she’d been busy for the past few days. Hopefully she could give me a hand once she was done running errands for Victorina, but for now illusions weren’t a realistic solution.

I’d done some poking around already, looking for manufacturers of telescopes, microscopes, really anything with a lenses, but I had no luck. Elves just didn’t seem to ever have vision problems that required glasses, and they just used Hawk Vision enchantments or their like in place of telescopes. It was quite expensive to get such an enchantment made, but it was probably comparable to the cost of a good and proper spyglass would have been. More durable as well, drop a Hawk Vision amulet or ring and it’s just going to bounce, it’s just a hunk of metal after all. Drop a spyglass, and you’ve just made a very expensive mistake.

That left peephole glasses. I tried a couple different designs, even one design that mirrored Inuit snow goggles, though I didn’t put much work into any of them. They looked goofy, and didn’t really work any better than the Hawk Vision amulet. It had taken me a while to get used to the magnification and narrow field of view, but once I did there were no more issues with disorientation and nausea. It still wasn’t an idea solution though, and it would be worse than useless in the arena. I’d take my blurry vision over the clarity of the amulet if it meant that I kept my situational awareness.

Victorina had pointed me in the direction of a storefront operated by The Mercers, apparently another of the University’s eleven or twelve guilds, which was supposed to be the best place for enchantments and other magical items.

*I’ll need to ask Victorina about the rest of the University’s guilds.*

-----

The Mercers’ store was an honest to god, magic shop.

*This is the greatest day of my life. Except for yesterday, which was also the greatest day of my life.*

The Mercers had chosen a rather large building to sell their wares from, but even still, the interior of the store was rather cramped. It was all quite well organized, but there was barely enough space for two elves to pass in the small corridors between the shelves. There was quite a lot to choose from and, at least compared to the substantial sum of money I had in the bank, the prices were fairly reasonable. I got rather side tracked when I found the various options for extra-dimensional storage space. There were your bog standard Bags of Holding, though they called them ‘Extra-dimensional Pouches’, but there were some more interesting alternatives available as well. I purchased a belt with several small extra-dimensional pouches, *I am magic batman,* along with a large chest with a similar enchantment, and something that was basically a Portable Hole. The belt was limited by what could actually fit through the opening to each pouch, but the enchantment on it would ensure that whatever I was looking for was immediately to hand. The chest and the ‘Extra-dimensional Handkerchief’ didn’t share that ability, but could store a great deal more, and weren’t limited by the belt’s smaller openings.

“Hey, if I put this Portable Hole inside one of the belt pouches is it going to open a gate to the Astral Plane and suck in every creature in a ten foot radius, destroying both the pouch and the hole?” I asked the saleswoman, as I paid for the goods.

She blinked, “Pardon me?”

*Damn, worth a shot.*

“What happens if I put one of these inside the other?” I asked.

“Oh, why didn’t you just ask that in the first place? Anything inside the container being put into the other extra-dimensional space comes pouring out. That’s not really a problem if there’s space for everything, but if there isn’t the extra things will be forced out of the container,” she explained.

I nodded, “Thanks. One other thing, if I wanted some custom work done, who would I talk to about that?” I asked.

“Um,” she started, “Amezzer, I can get him for you if you want.”

“That would be great,” I said, and she scurried off to find him.

I stuffed the chest into the portable hole, slipped on the belt, and put the hole into one of my pockets.

*This is certainly easier than lugging it all home.*

I looked around a bit more while I waited for Amezzer, and I purchased a few choice items. There were wands and staves to choose from, and I suppose if my hands worked I might have bought one, but their main purpose was to act as a focus when casting with gestures. I’d have a better idea of just what was useful once I’d been at the University for a bit longer, but there were some essentials that would always be important, regardless of my magical ability. So I stocked up on various healing items, there were potions, salves, ointments, and powders, and I bought a few of each. Food and water were on the list, though I’d need to pick those up elsewhere. An extra set or two of clothing would go in as well once I got home. I considered including some tools, but most tools are made irrelevant when your primary means of interacting with the world is through telekinesis. This was especially the case since I could shape the manipulators into any form I wanted, this was apparently an uncommon skill with Apportation. Not as uncommon as being able to cast it naturally, but according to Minki it was close, most people had to make do with hand analogues.

I went looking for a couple of the candles that the notary used to ensure truthful testimony, but the sale of those were restricted legally, something about mind control magic being tightly controlled. Instead I found some that would instead indicate if someone was lying, which as I’d discovered during my chat with the notary, were potentially more useful. I hoped to find a ring of feather fall, or ring of sustenance, but neither were to be found. There were a few different options for flying magic, and damn they were tempting. They were incredibly expensive though, even with my windfall, and I wasn’t prepared to spend such a large proportion of my savings on a single object. I was also still a little unsure of my position here at the University, and I didn’t want to go off spending so much of my money when I might need it to fall back on later. I could imagine a situation where I lost the monthly stipend from the University, and in that case I’d want to make sure my savings could stretch as long as possible.

I did pick up a pair of rings of water breathing though, one would go in my pouch, and I’d wear the other. Two was probably overkill, but on the other hand, water had not been terribly kind to me so far.

“Are you sure that you’ve quite enough?” asked a high, educated, voice from behind me.

I turned to see a tall, at least for an elf, young man in indigo robes, with gold hair pulled back in a ponytail. He was inspecting my pile of healing items with some amusement. He had a slightly shorter, older elf, shadowing him. Judging from the lack of mage robes I guess that he was a steward or valet.

I shrugged, “Not sure if any of this will help with accidental dismemberment, so probably not. I guess it’ll have to do though,” I replied, “I’m Quinn by the way.”

“And I am Diova Tanaka,” he replied.

There was a pause, quite a long pause, as we looked at each other. It seemed like he was waiting for me to say something.

“Nice to meet you Diova?” I said, though it was more of a question.

 “I take it that you’re an Outsider, new to Elardia?” His steward asked from just behind him, and I nodded, “Well in Elardia it is generally considered polite to bow slightly to those of higher rank upon meeting them.”

“Well if you insist,” I said, smiling, “But there’s really no need for your charge to be bowing to me.”

The steward seemed not to know what to say to this, though Diova raised his eyebrows and nodded slightly.

“It’s fine Seco,” he said, waving dismissively, “I’ve seen you around the building Victorina leases from my family. I’ve been told that you’re not actually taking part in any illicit rendezvous, and have actually joined Victorina’s club. Is this correct?”

“Yeah,” I nodded, “Why?”

“Why? With your rank and talent, you could find yourself a place in nearly any club. Why settle for Victorina’s little party?” He asked, genuinely curious, rather than rude.

*Because I feel a little more comfortable around women? Because it helps me avoid the dominance games in an all male group?*

“It’s a really nice building,” I said honestly, “Quite a lot better than that massive stone monstrosity The Order of the Claves maintains.”

“Thank you,” he said, smiling, “Talented or not, the building does smell slightly of stale beer, urine, and unwashed bodies.”

I laughed a little, “What about you? I suppose if you’re leasing out our clubhouse, you’ve got to have something even better.”

“Oh, I do,” he said, clearly pleased with himself, “The club I lead resides in the guildhall belonging to The League of Patricians.”

“That’s one of the University’s guilds, isn’t it?” I asked, *oh, and this one’s called a ‘League’, fancy.*

“Yes, and we would be willing to make a space for you, if you felt so inclined. I’ve heard of your talent at least, if not your rank, before today. We would be pleased to add you to our team, and we wouldn’t expect you to hand over such large sums of money for the privilege either,” he said, and I raised an eyebrow, “Yes, I know how Victorina manages to pay the lease,” he acknowledged.

“Make a space? You’d give one of your other members the boot?” I asked, *is this guy price-gouging Victorina?*

“Of course, one must be rational about this sort of thing. Talent of four is all well and good, but I find six to be preferable. I’m sure I’d be able to convince the rest of the guild council that you’d make a fine new member,” he offered.

*He’s droppin’ hints all over the place, “Oh yeah, I’m on the council of one of the guilds”. Not only that…*

“Six? Not eight? I guess this meeting wasn’t just coincidence then,” I said, smirking slightly.

“Ah, I suppose I’ve been caught out. I make it a habit to go looking for talent, just as Victorina does.”

“It’s a good offer, and I’ve only been with Victorina a week, but she’s been good to me. I don’t think I can bail on her,” I said.

He frowned, “I suppose I can respect that. The offer stands though. You may come by the guildhall if you change your mind. Good day Quinn.”

“Good day Diova,” I said and he left.

-----

Amezzer appeared almost immediately upon Diova’s departure, he’d apparently been waiting a respectful distance away. Though probably close enough to eavesdrop on our conversation.

“I’m impressed,” said the elf, who looked about middle aged and wore fairly plain green robes, “People don’t generally refuse such offers, especially not when Diova’s the one making them.”

I just shrugged, “He seems nice enough, but I like Victorina’s club.”

“Hey, do as you like, but there’s only so much room for growth in a club like hers.”

“You mean a club made up mostly of women?” I challenged.

He shrugged, “Maybe? The real problem is that Victorina’s not being supported by any of the guilds.”

“I’ll sort something out,” I sighed, “I was told that you were the guy to talk to about custom enchantments, is that right?” I asked, changing the subject.

He nodded, “That’s right, what is it that you’re looking for?”

I pulled off my Hawk Vision amulet, “I was wondering if you could create a Hawk Vision enchantment like this one, but with a bit less magnification, and with a much larger field of view.”

He grimaced, which was not a good sign, “Generally when someone asks for custom work, it’s because they want an existing enchantment on a specific item. What you’re asking me for isn’t really custom enchanting work, it’s a custom **enchantment.** To develop a whole new enchantment…” He hesitated, “It’s something we can do, but that sort of work can take years, and it’s not cheap. Even for someone of your status.”

“Damn,” I said, *this is not what I want to hear.*

“Is it that important?” He asked, “It just doesn’t seem like it’d be worth the expense.”

“Yeah it’s important,” I said, trying not to snap at the man. “My vision is awful, I had hoped that I’d be able to get an enchantment to fix it. Do any alternative solutions come to mind?”

“Ehh… Not really. Hawk Vision is your best bet, and like you’ve already figured out, the enchantment as designed has a very narrow viewing angle. It’s probably going to be custom, or nothing.”

“Which means right now, I’ve got to settle for nothing,” I said, a little bitterly.

“I’m afraid so.”

-----

I walked around the university for a while, ‘seeing’ the sights, and at least getting a feel for the layout of the place. I found that walking helped me to think, and I barely paid any attention to my surroundings as I thought over possible solutions too my two crippling injuries. Amezzer had given me an estimate on what he thought it would take to develop a brand new enchantment to my specification, and it was nowhere near reasonable. The trouble with the University handing out so much money to highly talented Mages was that it made the sort of thing I wanted really damned expensive. Mass casting of existing enchantments was fairly economical, it was how most of the less talented Mages made their money after all. You didn’t need to be incredibly skilled at enchantment to do well at it, you just needed to be ‘good enough’ and willing to put in the hours. To invent a brand new enchantment though? That took a highly talented mage, with a hell of a lot of schooling, and you had to pay him enough that he’d be willing to put in a year or two of solid work. There were also only so many Mages capable of such a thing, and due to the nature of the contract, they’d be busy for the entirety of those one or two years. The number he’d quoted me was double the bursary I was being paid by the University, for a probable two years. I could just about manage that, if I didn’t pay any dues to Victorina’s club, and if I could find an alternative revenue stream.

*Hell, I probably can find another way to make money. I’d just rather figure it out* ***before*** *hand. Throwing money at the problem is definitely an option, but it’s one that’ll need to wait a bit.*

I was a little more optimistic about my hands though. I’d had some time to think about it, and I was pretty sure I had what I needed to at least attempt a solution. It was hard to place the level of technology in this world, since at least aesthetically it seemed like some mishmash of Greco-Roman and Victorian themes, but I guessed that there was no elf equivalent to Leonardo Da Vinci. Whether it was just to ‘early’ technologically speaking, or the abundance of magic, the elves seemed to have a fairly simplistic view of anatomy. Bones, blood vessels, arteries, and muscles seemed to be understood to some degree, but anything more than that was beyond them. A bad gut wound for example, even with magical healing, was all but a death sentence. There was simply too much going on in there that they didn’t understand, and it didn’t help that it was very easy for such a wound to get infected. My advantage though, was that one time I might have sort of glanced over a diagram, maybe, of what the nerves in the human body looked like. Maybe. I was banking on the fact that magic, at least to some extent, was as much an art as it was a science. Some things ‘just happened’, entirely from intuition, and it probably helped to have a lot of talent. A good example was my first test of Basic Illusion, back in Myra. I’d recreated myself right down to each hair and pore, I hadn’t thought about myself in such detail, I’d just imagined me, and then there I was. I hoped that it was enough to know what nerves were, and know what they did, for the magic to fill in the gaps. My guess was that most Mages when healing something are thinking thoughts along the lines of, *make it better,* without really knowing what’s wrong. That meant that the magic would just knit damaged stuff, to damaged stuff, without paying much attention to whether or not it was the right sort of damaged stuff getting knitted together. I knew what was wrong, I knew how it was wrong, hopefully that was enough.

-----

I stopped by a couple stores on my way back home, *and it is home,* and picked up a few things. The portable hole had a hell of a lot of internal volume, and I decided to make use of it. I’d originally thought to store pemmican, or some other preserved food, in my extra-dimensional storage solutions, and I probably would put some in one of the belt pouches. There was enough room in the portable hole though for one of the full sized magical fridges though, so I bought one of those as well. There were also a few magical freezers and magical stoves on offer as well, and I also got one of each of those.

The Mage running the magical equivalent of Sears asked me if I wanted to complete the kitchen set, and he showed me what was essentially a standalone section of kitchen countertop. There was space for preparing food, and a sink set into the counter. I couldn’t help it, I burst into laughter, and I was sure that the little elf thought that I’d gone insane. I took that as well, and made a speedy departure, still giggling to myself.

I stopped by an open air market as well, and collected the ingredients that I’d need to prepare the dinner I had in mind. I’d promised Victorina that I’d cook occasionally after all, and I felt like I owed them something special, Minki in particular.

-----

Sila was waiting for me outside the clubhouse.

Well, waiting wasn’t quite the right word. For one thing, she was standing on the far side of the street. For another, she seemed to be lurching back and forth. One moment she’d step confidently to cross the street, then she’d chicken out, turn around, and walk back. She stood there for a second, arms wrapped around herself, seeming to take deep breaths, before turning around and trying again. She did this a couple times, before I finally decided to make myself known.

She didn’t notice me as I walked up behind her, she was far too distracted, and was staring intently at the front door of the clubhouse. I smirked, and stood there quietly as she worked herself up to it.

*I guess human hearing really is better than elf hearing.*

She got as far as the third stride, before her courage broke, and she turned around. She froze, as soon as she saw me, and I realized for the first time that this might have been a bad idea.

She stood there shocked, big brown eyes like pools of chocolate, full lips slightly parted. Her long brown hair had been pulled over one shoulder, and cascaded over her sky blue robes. They didn’t have the sheen of silk, but they marked her clearly as a Mage.

*Dammit, I’ve got to let her hug me.*

“Quinn!” She half shouted, leaping forwards to wrap her arms around me.

She thumped into my chest, and I had to step back slightly to keep my balance.

*I should have found a back door, or climbed in through a window, anything to do this indoors, and not in the middle of the street.*

“Good to see you too Sila,” *I’m glad you’re over my rather brusque departure,* “Why don’t we go inside?”

It took her a second to let go of me, but eventually she relented, “It’s just so good to see you Quinn! I got your present,” she said, holding out one bracelet hand, “It’s really pretty, thank you so much.”

*Uh oh, I really hope that she didn’t misinterpret that…*

“You’re welcome Sila, why don’t we go inside?” I repeated.

Sila seemed too excited to be paying much attention to what I was saying, and carried on, “I’m so glad I came Quinn, how have you been? I’ve been great, and I can do magic now. I still only know a tiny bit, you probably know way more since you’ve been here so much longer,” she laughed, “But I’m trying my best. You’ve even gotten into a club already, I’m still trying to find one.”

“I’ve been… pretty good Sila. Why don’t we talk inside?” I asked, for the third time.

“Oh, is that going to be okay?” She said, ducking away from the clubhouse a little, “Isn’t Victorina supposed to be really mean?”

“It’ll be fine, come on,” I said, and I led her inside.

# Chapter 30

Victorina

-----

“What about invisibility? I’m sure I can find more uses for that than your little Verridisiac potion,” I said wryly.

Thera let out an exasperated sigh, “That was one time Vicky, are you ever going to let it go?”

I’d run into Thera on the balcony overlooking the front entry way, and we were both leaning against the railing as we talked.

“One time? I remember the last time you had your ‘friend’ over. I’m fairly sure that neither of you were in your right mind. I’m just glad you had Neferoy cast that soundproofing enchantment.”

“Oh stopit,” she said, laughing and batting at me with one hand, “Besides, Ninu is the one who brews the potion anyway.”

Now it was my turn to sigh, “The point Thera-“ I started to say.

She cut in, “I can do invisibility. Well, I can start learning it. It’s a lot harder than the other recipes I know, it’ll take a while. Until then you’ll need to make do with Haste and Healing, unless you want some Verridisiac potions of your own...” she teased.

“I think I can manage without, thank you,” I said.

“Um…”

“What is it Thera?” I asked impatiently.

“It’s still only going to turn **you** invisible…” she said, looking down at her feet.

“So you’re telling me that I’d need to strip naked to get any use out of it?” I asked, as I rubbed at my temples.

“Well if the potion does end early, you do have plenty to show off…” she teased.

“Thera!” I chastised.

We were interrupted by the front door opening below us, and we both looked down to see who’d come in. It was Quinn, and… a slim brunette woman. Thera leapt back behind the pillar as soon as she saw Quinn and the girl, and Quinn looked up at the sound.

*Very good ears.*

I’d seen Quinn’s… *companion?* a few times before, looking for a club to join. The professor handling her orientation had asked me if I’d be interested in adding her to the team, and I’d dismissed her, almost out of hand. I knew that she was only of the fourth level of talent, which was bad enough. Between that, the low rank, and total absence of education, it was clear that she had nothing useful to add to my club. I didn’t even bother to meet her.

*And now Quinn is bringing her here, why?*

The girl seemed to notice the way I was looking at her, and ducked her head, stepping behind Quinn. She was standing about as close to him as possible, without actually touching him.

“Uh, hi Victorina,” he said awkwardly.

*Oh, something’s got him rattled. Just what are we up to Quinn?*

“Who’s this?” I asked, nodding towards the girl.

“This is Sila, she’s ah, uh,” he hesitated, “Friend.”

I raised an eyebrow sharply, “Oh?” *Do you mean a ‘friend’ like Thera?*

Quinn was an attractive man, and an Outsider. An exotic Outsider at that, I knew more than a few women that might enjoy ‘mountain climbing’, and had expected that I’d need to put up with the occasional ‘visitor’. I could put up with that. I could not put up with Quinn’s ‘conquests’ expecting to join the club come morning, just because they’d bedded one of its members.

*I’m going to have to talk to Quinn about that. He might not realize that some more opportunistic women will view him purely as a way into the club.*

“Yeah, we’ve got a bit of catching up to do, as you can imagine. I’d rather have that conversation inside, than out on the street,” he said, “I hope that’s not too much trouble.”

“That’s fine Quinn,” I said, and I felt a little guilty.

Quinn didn’t deserve **quite** that level of cynicism, even if he was related to Andrew. By all accounts Andrew was quite the talented Mage, but he, like most male Outsiders, was a hopeless womanizer. I’d expected more of the same from Quinn, if that was the price to get such a talented Mage, then I supposed that I’d just need to pay it. I shouldn’t have been so harsh though, Quinn hadn’t said much about his time in Adympia, but it seemed like there were still some wounds that had yet to heal. Besides, he’d been perfectly gentlemanly so far, even if he was spending a great deal of time alone with Minki.

*I can reserve judgement for later, for now, he deserves the benefit of the doubt. Especially if she really is just a friend.*

“By the way Quinn,” I said, pointing to a bench near the door, where a package sat, “That came for you earlier. I’m guessing it’s your Mage robes.”

“Oh, thanks Victorina,” he said, and I descended the stairs as he pulled open the wrapping.

Thera remained at her place behind the pillar, and the girl seemed to make an effort to avoid hiding behind Quinn as I approached. Quinn took off his jumper, he called it a ‘hoodie’, and pulled on the robes that had come in the package. He turned to face the two of us.

“What do you think?” He asked, settling the robes around himself.

“Oh my,” the girl said, clearly surprised.

I must admit, I shared her reaction, though I hid it much better.

Quinn’s robes were a deep indigo, I’d noticed that much when he’d first pulled them on, but they also had deep purple trim, something only visible once he’d turned around.

*Royal blood is one thing. Imperial blood though? Well…*

Realistically it didn’t change much, Quinn was still the same man, though it did add quite a bit of prestige to the club as a whole. The girl seemed rather strongly affected though, she must have assumed that Quinn was of low birth like herself, and suddenly finding that to not be the case was clearly a shock.

“I-I had no idea, Y-Your Grace,” she said, and she curtsied clumsily, “I’m sorry if I’ve ever given offence to you, or been improper, or… I really had no idea.”

I raised a hand to my mouth to conceal a smile, *I don’t know how long these two have known each other, but I can imagine her going over every day they ever spent together. Every time she ever spoke to him as an equal, everything she said that was perfectly fine between a pair of peasants, but entirely unacceptable for a peasant to say to one of Quinn’s rank.*

Quinn just blinked at the girl, and rubbed at his forehead with the back of one hand, “Your Grace? Have you seen me dance?”

“No milord, but I’m sure if you did dance you’d-“ the girl started to say.

“Enough Sila, I’m still the same Quinn. You don’t need to bow and scrape. Hell, Victorina’s robes are entirely purple. You’re not ‘You’re Gracing’ her and curtsying to her,” he said, clearly exasperated.

“Oh, sorry, of course milord,” she said, and she curtsied to me, “Your Grace.”

“That’s…” Quinn started, “That’s not what I meant at all.”

I left Quinn to his predicament, and went upstairs to find out what was wrong with Thera. It was not like her to hide when guests were over, that was more like something Minki would do, and even she wasn’t quite so obvious about it. Quinn managed to get the girl moving towards one of the smaller sitting rooms, he likely didn’t want an audience for his conversation, and Thera stepped out from behind the pillar once they’d left.

I just raised a questioning eyebrow.

"We’ve met.”

“Oh?”

“It’s a bit of a long story,” she said, running a hand through her hair.

“Well, I’ve got time.”

-----

Thera made tea for the two of us, and then she told her story. It was a long story, and an interesting one as well, especially the part where Thera explained just how it was the girl had come to be at the University. Thera’s explanations made some things a little clearer, especially the sudden change from frightened clinginess, to stiff deference. I learned a little about Quinn’s life prior to his trouble journey to finally arrive here at the University, and Thera explained just what the relationship between Quinn and the girl was. It was actually fairly simple, the girl worshiped the ground that Quinn walked on, and Quinn seemed unwilling to reciprocate the girl’s attentions. If what the girl had told Thera was true, than Quinn didn’t really have any other friends during his time in the little peasant village, and the two had grown rather close. The girl had even nursed him back to health, essentially on her own, after his calamitous encounter with the Banestorm.

I did agree with Thera, it was all really rather romantic, but I could certainly understand Quinn’s hesitation to take things any further with the girl. The girl seemed to think that Quinn’s hesitation was purely due to his plan to leave, and according to Thera the girl had gone on at some length as to how everything would be different now that she’d be joining Quinn at the University.

“Do you think that Quinn shares those feelings?” I asked, sighing, “Am I going to need to invite her to join?”

Thera shrugged, “I have no idea. Quinn didn’t mention her at all when we were in Myra. Actually…” she trailed off, seeming to think, “Oh, oh my… Actually, if I’ve put together the chain of events right… Two days after Quinn’s rather brusque goodbye to Sila, he was jumping into bed with me.”

I raised an eyebrow, “Are you two still…”

She shook her head, “Nah, the flirting’s just a bit of fun. And I like to tease him, it’s cute when he blushes.”

“Well, I guess he got over her rather quickly. I can see him making a hasty goodbye to try to soften the blow to both of them. If there was something there, but he thought that he was leaving for good, then anything else might just make them both feel worse. Better to let them both move on as quickly as possible. But if he was so quick to take you up on your offer…”

“Then it seems like things were rather one sided, yeah,” Thera finished.

I rubbed at my eyes, “I do not need this much drama in the clubhouse, I really hope Quinn isn’t going to ask me to let her join.”

“Yeah, I don’t want to touch this mess with a barge pole. It was a bit of fun on the ship, a little bit of illicit gossip about Quinn, now it’s right here in front of us,” she agreed.

*Maybe I need to revise my judgement about Quinn, vis-à-vis, womanizing.*

“Would you let her join?” she asked.

I sighed, “I suppose, if Quinn really wants her along, I’ll let her join. Maybe it’s just her sort of worshipful affection that will soften whatever scars Quinn collected in Adympia. I’d really rather not though, she’s not that talented, she’s spent her whole life in a tiny village, and I doubt that she’s the person to help Quinn heal.”

We were both quiet for a while, both finding something terribly interesting in our teacups.

Finally, I spoke, “Thera… Is Quinn really **that**, uh, big?”

I looked at her under my brows, while I waited for her to stop laughing.

“Maybe you should find out for yourself, since you really want to know so bad. Are you looking for something **biiig** to satisfy that hunger?” She teased, drawing out the word ‘big’.

“Hey! I’m not the one bringing it up all the time!” I said, a little defensively.

“It’s like I said, I just like to tease him. He might be a little bigger than most elves, but that’s probably down to humans seeming to be bigger in general.”

“Well,” I said haughtily, “You’d be the one to know, wouldn’t you?”

I got hit in the face with a pillow almost immediately, and there was a brief, but violent, cushion based battle in the small sitting room.

# Chapter 31

Victorina

-----

Quinn saw Sila to the door some time later. I didn’t know the details of what Quinn said to her, but based on what Thera told me, and Sila’s red eyes and blotchy face, I could guess.

He sat down on the bench by the door after she’d left, with a lost look on his face, starting at the floor. I watched him for a moment, with his eyes as bad as they were, I don’t think he saw me standing just inside the hallway. Whatever he was thinking about, whether it was Sila or his time in Adympia, it clearly troubled him.

I stepped out into the entry room, and he perked up immediately.

“How did it go?” I asked, as I walked over to sit beside Quinn.

Quinn just sighed and shook his head, “Sometimes I just feel like an alien, like there’s some big piece of the puzzle that I don’t understand.”

I raised an eyebrow, “Well…”

Quinn laughed bitterly, “Not just now, back when I was on Earth as well. Granted, actually being an alien hasn’t done anything to help matters.”

“You told her about Adympia?” I asked.

“Yeah, not sure that was a great idea.”

“Why not? She clearly cares about you, and she’d find out eventually from someone else. Better that she hears it from you.”

“I suppose you’re right. It’s just not something I really want to talk about, and judging from the amount of tears, it wasn’t really something she wanted to hear,” he said.

“It’s because she cares Quinn. She doesn’t want you to get hurt, but she does want to know what’s happened to you while you’ve been separated. I do understand that you don’t want to talk about it, but sometimes talking about it can help.”

“Maybe, It’s just…” he sighed, “Honestly, while I was actually there in Adympia, it wasn’t that bad. Or at least, I didn’t think it was that bad at the time. It was only after I’d escaped, after I’d had time to process everything that had happened, that I really became aware of just how terrible it was. But even then, it’s actually talking about it that I find to be more difficult. Actually escaping was the easy part.”

“Are you serious?” I asked incredulously, “Just your swim from the harbour would have killed most elves. Even assuming they had the endurance to make the swim, which I’m fairly sure is not the case, the currents would have dragged them to the bottom of the bay or smashed them against the rocks. That’s not even including whatever you had to go through before that, let alone after, to escape. And that was easier than sitting down and talking about it?”

He shrugged sheepishly, “Maybe ‘easier’ is the wrong word. But I knew what I needed to do when I was in Adympia, and that was escape. It was a massively dangerous, life threatening situation, but it was a situation I understood. A crisis I can think about logically. The problems are usually clearly defined, I can consider the risks, and potential obstacles. I can come up with solutions for the problems, ways to mitigate the risks, and establish contingencies for any obstacles that might come up. If afterwards someone asked me to write a military report, something cold and clinical, on the whole experience then I’d be able to do that. I’d write the fuck out of that report, because that’s how I thought about the situation while I was in the middle of it. But ask me how it made me feel?” He threw up his hands, “I still don’t know how I feel about it, not really. The feeling part I’m still processing.”

I just shook my head and smiled, “I’m guessing that this is not typical of humans? At least if Brandy and Andrew are anything to go by.”

“Heh, no,” he said, “Certainly not.”

“Actually… On the topic of Andrew, how do you feel about going to meet him?” I asked.

“Uh, I don’t hate the idea,” he hedged, “I don’t **really** want to though, I feel like there’s going to be more of me explaining the whole slavery thing, and I’m also not a big fan of Andrew or his brothers in general.”

“Quinn,” I sighed, “They are still your family. I understand why you might not want to talk about your experiences, but family is important. You might have purple on your robes, but that means very little if you have no one standing behind you. The purple isn’t a symbol of rank, not really, it’s there to show the rest of the University just what and who you have to call upon for aid.”

He put up his hands in surrender, “I know, I know, and I’m probably being petty. Well, I am being petty. I’ll go see them eventually, I don’t know how much help I’m going to get from them though.”

“I’m guessing that the dislike is mutual?” I asked.

“Yeah, we’ve never really liked each other.”

“Oh?”

“Yeah, I’ve always been the quiet bookish type. I’d rather stay inside, reading books or gaming, and it’s only relatively recently that I got as physically fit as I am now. I’ve always been quite good at school, without much effort, but I’ve never been very good at sports. Andrew and his brothers on the other hand are rather the opposite. That’s not to say that they’re unintelligent, they’re perfectly average for Earth, and that probably makes them better educated than even most nobles here in Elardia. But their interests always ran counter to mine. They liked, and were good at, sports. I like, and am good at, games. I never liked sports much, because I was never much good. They liked games just fine, but they never liked to play with me because I’d always stomp them. They’d tease me for being a ‘nerd’ and not being good at sports, and I’d call them stupid because the only thing they were good at was kicking a ball. It’s all childish nonsense, but it’s coloured our relationship since we were all very young.”

“At least you’re self-aware enough to recognize that it’s childish,” I said wryly, “Hopefully your cousins have figured that out for themselves as well. Who knows Quinn, maybe a little reconciliation is in order. I ask, because I’m actually going to meet with King Nezzabi tomorrow. You could come along to see your family, and you’d get the chance to meet the King. He might even look favourably upon you, since he’s already playing patron to the rest of your family.”

“Alright,” Quinn conceded, “I do want to know what they’re up to anyway… Andrew being more talented than me at magic is bullshit though.”

I let out a very unladylike snort, “Have something to prove Quinn?”

“It’s just not right,” He said indignantly, though he seemed half-joking, “The universe is conspiring against me, all that time teasing me for playing Dungeons & Dragons, and now he’s the one with more magic. Dammit, but that’s not how it’s supposed to work!”

“Oh? And how is it supposed to work?”

“It’s very simple,” he said confidently, “The quiet and awkward nerd, who is also intelligent, tall, handsome, fit, and clever, is supposed to get the awesome magic power. Then he’s supposed to use that power to show how much better he is than all the dumb jocks, and make them very sorry for picking on him when he was younger.”

I raised an eyebrow, “Are there maybe some repressed frustrations there Quinn?”

“Certainly not, I’m too intelligent and clever for that,” he said seriously, “And humble, I’m the most humble person you’ve ever met.”

I just rolled my eyes, “You said you like games, have you had a chance to try any since getting to the university?”

“Not really, I’ve not played Zatrikion since before Adympia. Why?”

“Well we’ve got some games here at the University that you might like, and they’re rather more interesting than Zatrikion. Tomorrow is Feastday, so most of us don't have anything important to do, at least not in the morning. Most times we’ll usually get together and relax a bit. I’ll order us some food, and we can all stay up late and show you some of the University’s games.”

Quinn looked like a child that had just been handed a new toy, and his face absolutely lit up.

“No!” Quinn shouted excitedly, as he leapt to his feet, striking a heroic pose, “**I**’ll make dinner tonight. Games night requires very specific food, and I shall prepare it. **To the kitchen!**”

I had no idea what to make of this, and before I could get my bearings Quinn had already run up the stairs and across the balcony to the kitchen. There was a brief commotion inside, before Kennocha was forcibly ejected, and the door slammed closed. She stood there for a moment, clearly very bewildered, and then she looked down at me, as if I had the damned answers.

“I guess Quinn’s cooking tonight,” I said, by way of explination.

-----

“Ohmygod, ohmygod, ohmygod, Pizza!” Brandy squeed.

Pizza was a strange dish, it seemed like some sort of strange pie, though it was shaped rather oddly. It was very flat, and much larger than any pie I’d ever seen. There was very little room for filling, and it seemed to be composed entirely of tomato. The upper crust seemed composed entirely of cheese, and there were slices of meat spread out across it.

*Tomato pie? Humans are quite odd.*

“Ohmygod, ohmygod, ohmygod, I haven’t had pizza in forever!” Brandy continued, and she gave Quinn a one armed hug, using the other hand to pile several slices of pizza onto a large plate, “You are the super best Quinn.”

“I’m glad you’re pleased,” he said, a little awkwardly, “Could you, uh,”

“Oh you are just the sweetest little nerdy boy ever,” she said, before going to the dining room to eat her ‘pizza’.

Quinn sighed, and I eyed the pizza suspiciously. The rest of the club seemed to share my reservations, and there were a few furtive glances as we waited to see who would be the first one to try Quinn’s creation.

“Quinn,” Kennocha started, “It’s not that I don’t like your cooking, but… It just seems very different.”

Ken was usually a little too staid for my tastes, but I had to agree with her in this case, pizza was strange.

Minki, surprisingly enough, was the first one to take the plunge. She’d been standing off to one side, a bit behind where Quinn had been standing, and she ducked under his elbow to snag a slice of pizza. She left the kitchen without saying a word, stopping only to get a drink, and went to go take a seat in the dining room. She hurried in a moment later, and took two more slices of pizza back into the dining room.

Minki’s word, *maybe not ‘word’,* of approval was enough, and the rest of us went ahead and tried Quinn’s creation. Pizza turned out to be delicious, and fortunately Quinn had accounted for the fact that everyone was going to want seconds.

-----

“This nerd stuff is actually kinda fun,” Brandy said, yawning and stretching like a cat, “Especially when there’s beer and pizza.”

“I’m glad you decided to join us this time,” Ken said while she cleaned up, “You never did before.”

“There was never pizza before,” Brandy replied, “Thanks by the way, Quinn.”

“You’re quite welcome. The next thing I make will probably be burgers,” Quinn said, *What? He’s going to make a Burgher?*

We’d been playing for hours, and it was nearly midnight by the time we’d started to wrap things up. Quinn had taken to the game immediately, and had said that it was similar to Earth games like ‘Warhammer’ or ‘Axis&Allies’. Whatever the case, Quinn had grasped the general strategy and tactics immediately, and only needed a little coaching in the rules to get going. He said that with the enchanted game pieces, this was the closest thing to ‘videogames’ that he was ever likely to see again.

Whatever ‘videogames’ might be, Quinn seemed to enjoy the experience, and he threw himself into the game. By the time we had finished he was able to win every fifth game or so against Minki or I, and was more or less evenly matched with the others.

“Quinn?” Ken asked softly, “Could you give me a hand here?”

“Hmm? Oh, sure,” Quinn replied, and he rose to assist Ken.

Minki was curled up in one of the big comfy chairs near the fire and was out absolutely cold. I don’t think she even finished her second beer, but that was a lot for a seventy five pound girl. Quinn scooped her up out of the chair, and her head lolled back, and her mane of shaggy grey hair hung loosely to cover her face. She didn’t stir at all as Quinn followed Kennocha out of the room, and down the hall to Minki’s room.

-----

I was waiting for Quinn when he left Minki’s room, and I could still hear Ken moving around in the room, putting Minki to bed. It took him a second to spot me as I leaned against the wall in the dark hallway, and he started a little when he noticed me.

“Sneaking up on me is no fair when my eyes don’t work,” he whispered accusingly.

“Oh hush, your ears more than make up for it,” I replied, “Come on.”

He followed me to the other wing of the clubhouse, where his room and mine were. We faced each other across the darkened hallway, both leaning against the wall next to our respective rooms.

“My meeting with King Nezzabi is just after lunch tomorrow, you’re still coming along?” I asked quietly.

“Yeah, how should I dress?” He asked, *a very good question.*

“Your Mage robes will be fine, wear the longer ones though,” I replied, and he nodded, “Ah, and about Sila. Do you want her to join the club?”

“Uh, what do you mean by that?” He asked me uncertainly.

I cocked an eyebrow, “What do you mean, what do I mean by that?”

“Were you planning on adding her to the club?” He asked.

“I had considered her before you ever arrived in Nimre, but she wasn’t quite up to my standards. Not that she’s not a perfectly nice girl Quinn, but-“

Quinn raised his hands, “Hey, I get it. She’s at talent four instead of five or six, and is rather lacking in the education department.”

“But if you want to have her along, then I suppose I can make allowances for her.”

Quinn grimaced, and took a moment to think, before he finally spoke, “No. She’s...” Quinn sighed, “She’s very sweet, but I don’t think it would be a great idea for her to join us.”

“Really?” I asked, a little surprised, *maybe he’s like most men, and is massively oblivious,* “You do know that she’s crazy about you, don’t you?”

“Yeah,” Quinn said, in a way that made me sure that there was some baggage there, “I know, that’s part of the problem.”

“You don’t feel the same way?” I asked softly, *not quite as romantic as I’d thought then.*

“No. She’s sweet, she’s pretty, and she’s even quite clever for someone that grew up in a peasant village. Hell, she was the one to nurse me back to health after that crash I told you about. It would probably be fair to say that she even deserves my affection, but… It’s just not there.”

I nodded, “I can understand how that might make things awkward, especially if she was living in such close quarters with you. What about Minki then?”

It was Quinn’s turn to raise an eyebrow, “What about her?”

“Well, the two of you have been spending quite a bit of time together.”

“Sure,” he acknowledged, “But that’s only because she’s been helping me with Apportation. Though, that’s not to say we haven’t gotten to know each other well.”

“Quinn, most of the time when Minki helps someone with something, she usually gives them a couple of hours. You two have been together almost every waking hour, since almost the first day you joined us. You’ve even been taking your meals together. Honestly, I haven’t picked up on either of you crushing very hard on the other, but both of you do a pretty good job of staying all closed up. The point is Quinn, Minki’s opened up to you, far more, and far more quickly than she has with anyone else. If it’s simply a matter of being good friends, then that’s fantastic, I like that Minki’s finally found someone she can relax with. But if it’s something more… Well, that might even be better. Though you two do make a rather mismatched couple,” I said, grinning, “Just don’t break her heart Quinn.”

*Like you have with Sila.*

Quinn nodded, “That is something that’s occurred to me, but I think it’s going to be a little while before I’m in the right mind for that sort of relationship. Friends are plenty for now.”

“Good,” I said, pleased. “And goodnight Quinn.”

“Goodnight Victorina,” he replied.

Quinn was an odd one, and not just because he was a human, though his size was odd enough. He seemed like a genuinely good person though, if a little complicated. He was arrogant, I had no doubts about that, but he also seemed to have an odd sort of self-awareness about it. He’d also been perfectly gentlemanly to everyone so far, and that counted a lot for me. It was nice to have a man around the clubhouse, and a handsome one at that, but it was important for him not to make anyone feel uncomfortable. I’d put this club together for a reason, I’d leased the house for a reason, it had to be a home, and the club would need to be a family. I was very thankful that Quinn had fit in so well, Minki had been my canary, and she’d taken to him far better than I’d ever imagined.

There would come a time, probably soon, when the club would be the only home, and the only family for the rest of my sisters. There was going to come a time when the titles held, the family relationships, and the money, counted for very little. And it would probably be soon.

# Chapter 32

Victorina

-----

“Should I bow to this Nezzabi guy when I meet him?” Quinn asked, as the carriage rumbled up the path to King Nezzabi’s castle.

We’d made the teleport to Akkash just after lunchtime, and had hired a carriage to carry us the rest of the way through the city. It simply wouldn’t do to show up tired sweaty from our hike through the city, we had an impression to make after all.

“This Nezzabi guy?” I asked wryly, “I do hope you address him with more respect when you meet him.”

“I’ll be respectful, I’m just not sure how I’m supposed to talk to this guy,” he said, “Do I bow? How do I bow? How is he addressed?”

*This guy?*

“How would you greet a monarch on Earth?” I asked, he’d not been very specific about his family on Earth, all I really knew I had gleaned from the colour of his robes.

“A slight bow? Earth is much less reserved than Elardia seems to be though. I’d probably address the Queen as ‘Your Majesty’, is that sufficient for King Nezzabi?”

“’Your Majesty’ is correct, however, such a bow is a rather familiar greeting for your first meeting with him,” I explained, “A more appropriate greeting would be to genuflect, ah, understand what that means?” I asked, at his look of confusion.

“Yeah,” he said, a little uncertainly, “Assuming it’s the same between Earth and Elardia. I promise not to embarrass you Victorina… too much.”

I just rolled my eyes, “You’re an Outsider, and even if King Nezzabi is patronizing your cousin’s family, he will probably make allowances for that fact.”

“Alright,” he nodded, “What about you? Why are you going to see him? Unless that’s a private matter.”

“No, it’s a perfectly fine question,” I assured him, “He just likes to check up on me. He helped me get settled in Nimre when I first arrived, I think he would have rather kept me in his court as his ward, but he didn’t push the matter when I insisted.”

“You must have been a demanding twelve year old,” he said with a smile.

“Mmm, definitely.”

“I’m guessing he’s not doing it entirely out of the goodness of his heart though,” he said, rather perceptively, “Do I need to watch where I step when I’m at the University so I don’t piss him off?”

“You should be fine,” I hedged, “He doesn’t have any family at the University, though many of his vassals do, but their problems are their own. He’s also not supporting us financially, if that’s what you’re thinking, despite his offer to do so. No, I think it’s more a matter of trying to secure the… loyalty? Of some skilled and talented Mages. As I said, he has none in his own family, so he does what he can to entice independent Mages to his side.”

Quinn nodded, “Independent, I guess that’s why you refuse the financial aid?”

“Yes,” I replied, “If circumstances change, he’s made it clear that the offer is open, but I do not want to make our club beholden to anyone.”

“I can certainly understand that,” he said, as the carriage came to a stop.

He disembarked as soon as the carriage stopped, rather than waiting for the coachman to open the door, and took the opportunity to stretch. He’d needed to hunch over to fit in the carriage, and I heard something pop in his shoulder as he stretched.

“Is there an Enlarge spell I can learn?” He asked absently, “Being a giant was rather interesting at first, but the novelty wore off rather quickly.”

“You mean to enlarge an object I’m guessing?” I asked, as I stepped out of the carriage.

Quinn did not offer an arm to help me down, and I wasn’t sure if that made me pleased, or irritated. I appreciated him respecting my focus on independence, but sometimes a lady likes to be taken care of.

“Yeah, **I** don’t need to be any larger,” he said, *mmm, that’s what Thera told me too.*

“Talk to Neferoy, she’s the one who knows all about crafting, transmutation, and material magic,” I explained, “She’s also our expert on enchantment.”

“Alright, I’m sure I’ll have plenty to talk to her about once I’ve got a better idea of just what I’m doing here,” he smirked, “I’ve got some ideas that I’d like to try.”

*Oh Victorina, what have you gotten yourself into with this one?*

One of the King’s stewards approached us in short order, and we were led through the keep and into a sitting room in the base of one of the forebuildings, to await the King’s attention.

“Is it possible to-” Quinn had begun to ask, before we were suddenly interrupted.

There was an indistinguishable shout, a hiss, a whoompf, and then a loud bang, from out in the courtyard. It gave me quite a start, and I bolted up from where I’d been sitting, a spell already on my lips.

Quinn raised a hand, “It’s alright Victorina, well, probably,” he said, as he went to the narrow exterior door. He stepped out onto the high platform that jutted from the side of the forebuilding, and peered over the railing to the courtyard below. I followed behind him, and looked out over the courtyard to see a formation of soldiers in the midst of some sort of drill. I thought at first that they were armed with some sort of spear, but even I could tell that they were holding the weapons wrong for that to be the case, and the weapons lacked any sort of sharpened tip as well. There was a great deal of smoke before the men, of which there were possibly thirty, all spread out in a single row. They faced a set of archery targets, but I couldn’t see how their weapons might possibly launch an arrow or a bolt. They seemed to consist mostly of a bronze tube, with a thick wooden section attached to the back, which was then tucked under one arm.

A sergeant at arms stood by, and he called out as the smoke cleared, “Withdraw match!”

At his order, each of the men pulled a sort of metal clip away from where it rested against the very end of the bronze tube. Each clip was hinged at the back, and seemed to hold a sort of candle wick.

“Draw powder!” Came the next order, and each of the men drew a pouch of some sort from their belts. They took it in their right hand, leaving the weapon in their left.

“Prime!” Shouted the sergeant, and I watched as the men each shook out a dash of this ‘powder’ onto a small pan. It had been what the wick had been resting against prior to the first of the sergeant’s orders.

“Fill powder!” And the men each lifted the pouch to the mouth of the tube, and poured some measure of the powder into the tube.

“Stow pouches!” he called, and the men returned the pouches to their belts.

“Load!” And each man withdrew something from a second pouch, and placed it into the end of the tube.

“Ramrods!” The sergeant shouted, and each man withdrew a long rod from under the long tube, and forced it down the barrel.

“Stow Ramrods!”

“Ready!” And the men each tucked their weapon under one arm.

The next command sounded like “Fire!” though it was hard to distinguish as the sergeant’s words were drowned out by the noise of the weapons firing. Over the course of a second or two, each of the weapons produced a bang and a gout of smoke, and I saw bits of straw puff up from one of the archery targets, and several flecks of stone spray up from the curtain wall behind the targets.

“Well Quinn, what do you think?” Came a voice from behind the two of us, and I turned to see a tall and thickly built human standing in the narrow doorway that led back into the sitting room.

“Uncle Walsh,” Quinn said, without turning around, “You’ve certainly been busy.”

The man, Uncle Walsh, stepped out of the doorway and walked up behind Quinn to pat him on the back. Quinn turned to face his Uncle, who then wrapped his arms around him in a big bear hug. The man only came up to Quinn’s shoulder, though that still made him taller than any elf I’d ever met. Quinn was clearly made uncomfortable by the hug, and it likely didn’t help when several of King Nezzabi’s Generals followed the Uncle out onto the balcony.

“Quinn!” Uncle Walsh said, patting Quinn on the back, “We hug in this family kid,” and Quinn acquiesced, slightly, by lifting his arms to return the hug half-heartedly.

“What happened to your glasses?” Quinn’s Uncle asked, once he’d released Quinn from his grip.

“Tried to catch the end of a spear with my face, it didn’t quite work out,” Quinn said, deadpan.

“Well at least you seem to have recovered, everyone,” Uncle Walsh said, turning to the Generals, “Meet my nephew, Quinn Angove.”

The others likely wouldn’t have spotted it, but I noticed as Quinn made an effort to gather himself and smile.

“Quinn, this is General Atrar, General Baresu, and General Nidama,” he said, as he indicated each of the Generals in turn.

“Nice to meet you,” Quinn said warmly and smiling genuinely, or at least it seemed genuine.

“The pleasure is mine,” said General Atrar, who had certainly noticed the colour of Quinn’s robes, “Lord Walsh was quite pleased when he’d heard that you were in Nimre, it’s good to finally meet you.”

“Oh?” Quinn asked, looking to his Uncle.

“Yeah,” Lord Walsh replied, “What took you so long to get here?”

Quinn shrugged, “I only learned that you were here a little while ago, I was focusing more on my studies at the University.”

“Right, Andrew said something about that, though he hadn’t spotted you walking around. Well, it’s good that you’re here now,” he said, and I got the impression that Quinn didn’t like something in the way that his Uncle had said that.

My speculation was interrupted however, by the arrival of King Nezzabi. We all rose as he entered the room, and I curtsied as the men, Quinn included, each bowed slightly. It was rather familiar of him, though hopefully it would be overlooked, considering the more intimate setting of the meeting. King Nezzabi cut a rather impressive figure, he wasn’t quite as thick as Lord Walsh, but he was certainly a strongly built man. His white hair was drawn back into a top not, and the colour was the only sign of age in the 254 year old man. King Nezzabi followed the older traditions of rulership, and led his armies into battle personally, fighting from horseback with his heavy cavalry. This was clear in his physique, and in the light tan he’d accumulated from his time in the sun. His clothing was of the utmost quality, though he’d dispensed with most of the frills that were more in favour in King Shammadea’s court. Instead the style here favoured a cut of clothing that one could conceivably fight in, following after King Nezzabi’s preference for short sleeves and a tunic that only fell as far as the thigh.

“Victorina,” he greeted me, using only my first name, “It’s good to see you,” he said, as he embraced me warmly.

“And this is Quinn?” He asked of Lord Walsh, “The nephew?”

“Yes, so he is. I understand you’ve got to talk to the little lady, but I can introduce him properly to you afterwards. I’m sure that Quinn will have a great deal to contribute once we get him settled.”

“Of course,” King Nezzabi said, ”Shall we?” and he extended an arm to me.

I took it, and followed him from the room.

-----

“I thought that Lord Walsh was tall, your Quinn is something else,” he said, once we were settled in a separate sitting room.

*My Quinn?*

“Quite, his height is apparently notable even among humans, I somehow doubt that you’ve asked me here to talk about my new club members though. What’s this about?” I asked him, as I peered over my teacup.

He only raised an eyebrow at my accusation.

“We met just a month ago, and you’re already calling me here. Something has clearly caught your notice,” I explained.

King Nezzabi frowned, “You’re right of course Vicky,” he said solemnly, “I’m afraid I have bad news for you, both of your brothers have been killed.”

“How?” I asked, looking down at my tea, I wasn’t quite sure how I felt about the news. It had been some time since I’d seen my brothers, and my family had tried to kill me more than once since I left Adympia.

“Well, I say killed, but the situation is still terribly unclear. This isn’t public knowledge as of yet Vicky, I’m only telling you so that you might be prepared for what happens when it does become public knowledge, but it appears that they were poisoned,” he explained.

“Poison? What kind of poison?”

“It is not known, some even dispute that it was poison. But both of them, both healthy young men, fell ill suddenly. I will spare you the details, the symptoms were apparently rather undignified, but they both died within three days of falling ill. What else but poison? Are you alright Vicky?” He asked.

“I’m fine,” I said coldly, “It’s been nearly twenty years since I’ve seen either of them, and Oppius was but a babe when I left. Who now is the heir?”

“Your younger sister,” he said quietly, “Jula.”

“Jula?” I exclaimed, “She’s only twelve, aren’t there any men left in the line of succession?”

“No, your father’s purges saw to that. I imagine you heard about some of the goings on, but he saw to it that the other branches of the family in a position to inherit were, dealt with.”

“I had heard,” I acknowledged, “I assumed it to be rumours spread by the King of Rhona, or even your own agents. It seemed like the sort of foolish paranoia that his rivals might accuse him of.”

“No, I’m afraid it’s the truth.”

“Damn him,” I said fiercely, “Has an attempt been made on his life?”

“Not as far as I know, though that may have changed in the past week or so. The information I’m getting out of the inner imperial court is rather delayed.”

“And yet…” I sighed.

“And yet,” King Nezzabi continued, “The stability of the largest empire in Elardia has been put into jeopardy.”

“So, what? One of the Kings takes his place?” I asked, I’d not paid as much attention to Adympian politics as I should have, I’d done my best to forget that part of my life.

“Yes, likely whichever one can amass the largest army, or secure some sort of foreign alliance. I imagine that they’ve already started to build up their forces for the coming war.”

“Which will be set off the instant that my father passes,” I sighed, “Who is in the best position right now? Who is most likely to take the imperial throne if war does break out?”

“It might start before even then,” the King said, “With each King building up his forces, they’ve each got a loaded crossbow pointed at their closest target. It wouldn’t take much to jostle a shoulder here or there.”

“Damn, and damn again,” I muttered.

“And that’s the question isn’t it?” King Nezzabi continued, “Your father went to great pains to ensure that his Kings were equally matched, by balancing each other’s power, each prevented by the others from growing too powerful, he never had to risk one of the Kings growing strong enough to challenge him directly. Unless one of the Kings had secured a secret alliance ahead of time, none of them is in a position to be the clear victor.”

“Why go to all this trouble though?” I asked, “Why tell me all this?”

*Are you going to reiterate your marriage proposal? Do you expect to swoop in and take the Adympian imperial throne?*

“You need to know Vicky, you are the eldest daughter after all,” he said, matter-of-factly.

“What?” I exclaimed, “I’m a Mage, less than elf by Adympian law. I’m the last person, not even the last, to be considered in the line of succession.”

“Maybe not,” he said, “But you are your father’s eldest living child. When it’s you or Jula, one might argue that whoever holds you, might have a stronger claim to the throne. More than that, a slave’s offspring are excluded from the line of succession, however…”

“What do you- You mean that technically I’m not a slave, even as a Mage?” I asked, and he nodded.

“Yes, you were never enslaved, so while you are a Mage, your offspring would be valid heirs. Technically,” he hedged.

 “Oh that’s just splendid,” I said, standing up and turning away from him, “So you’re telling me that I have kidnapping and rape to fear, from whichever of the Kings hopes that he might father an imperial heir. Which is all of them,” I rubbed at my eyes with one hand, “I’m going to need to tell my clubmates, I’ll need to strengthen the security at my clubhouse, they’ll want to know why.”

“Vicky, you don’t need to do this alone,” he said, and I knew what was coming next, “I can offer you a measure of protection and security that you can’t get from simple enchantments.”

*You mean if you were allowed to father the imperial heir? You’ll protect me as long as I let you fuck me?*

“No.” I said, with restrained anger. It took me a moment to compose myself, I still needed this relationship, I couldn’t take my rejection as far as I might have liked, “I appreciate the offer Your Majesty, but I escaped alone, and I will continue alone.”

“What about your clubmates?” He asked, I still hadn’t turned to face him, and I could feel his eyes on my back.

“That’s different” I said, “I did that. And I will need to tell them, I hope that’s acceptable to you.”

He was quiet for a moment, and I stood rather stiffly at one window, “That is acceptable, though I’d take care to account for the fact that you might not have most of your clubmates for very much longer. It would be best not to tell Halea or Kennocha for example, I know that both of them will likely be returning home before the end of this next semester.”

*That soon? Shit.*

“I will only tell those that need to know,” I said guardedly, “Thank you Your Majesty.”

King Nezzabi sighed, “The offer stands Vicky, you’ll still have your place here if you change your mind.”

*My place? Oh, I think I know what you mean by that.*

“Thank you Your Majesty,” I said, trying to keep the anger from boiling over into my voice, “If I may be excused, I’d like to see how Quinn is getting along.”

“Of course Vicky,” he said in a friendly manner, “We’ll both go.”

-----

I followed King Nezzabi and a few of his retainers back to the sitting room. His retainers, thankfully, had not been privy to our conversation, and had remained outside while we’d spoken. We arrived back at the sitting room, to hear a rather heated discussion going on.

*Looks like nobody is getting to hear what they want to hear today.*

“You selfish bastard,” I heard Lord Walsh shout. His voice carried even through the thick bronze banded wooden door that led into the sitting room, and I could see seven very uncomfortable men waiting in the hallway outside.

There were the three Generals, the adjutants to the Generals Baresu and Nidama, and three guardsmen. Despite their obvious discomfort, they seemed pleased that they’d managed to escape the room, and the ongoing shouting match, so far.

“The rest of us are all doing our part for the family, if you think you can just run off then you’ve got another thing coming,” Lord Walsh finished.

I turned to look at King Nezzabi, who did not seem pleased, and we both stopped outside of the room. One of the adjutants looked from the King, to the door, and then back to the King, with a questioning look. King Nezzabi shook his head, he didn’t want to walk into the middle of this either.

Quinn must have made some sort of response, though it wasn’t audible through the door, because I heard another bellow from the room, “Yeah, and? I’m the more talented Mage,” said the voice, likely Andrew’s, “We don’t need another damn Mage, we’ve already got the best one, me. You must just be too much of a coward to work for the General.”

There was a quiet moment again, while Quinn responded, and then a response from Lord Walsh, “Yeah, well you know what you little s-“ Lord Walsh managed to censor himself, before continuing, “You really think you can do this on your own? What are you going to do when I cut you off?” And there was the briefest of pauses, “Oh yeah? Really? A bursary? I had no idea! Well you know what,” he said, his voice growing lower, and I had to strain to hear, “How about I take it away? How about that you selfish bastard? I bet you’d get a lot more family focused then.”

Quinn’s next response was louder, still too quiet to make out details, but I got the gist of it, and there was a great deal of profanity involved.

"Hell yes I can do that!” Shouted Lord Walsh, “I already told you how important family is Quinn, and guess what? I’m in charge of this family, and the University damn well recognizes it.”

*He’s not taking* ***any*** *of my people.*

I pushed open the door to the room, ignoring the half-hearted protests from the group of men by the door. I entered the room to find Quinn sitting stiffly in one large armchair, with Lord Walsh, and Andrew, doing their best to loom over Quinn. Quinn’s jaw was set, and he was staring his uncle right in the eye.

“Quinn, do you have that bill of pedigree?” I asked, loudly enough to surprise Lord Walsh, and hold off his next outburst.

Quinn’s eyes lit up, and then he allowed himself a small smile. One belt pouch opened of its own accord, and a scroll floated out, which then unrolled itself.

“Oh yeah?” Andrew asked, “And what the hell is the point of this?”

“Your robes are orange Andrew, Quinn’s are indigo and purple,” I pointed out, “The University will not acknowledge your father’s authority over Quinn if Quinn’s branch of the family outranks your own. The bill of pedigree simply proves the difference.”

“Bullshit you’re a fucking Emperor,” Andrew said, “If you think-“

“ENOUGH!” King Nezzabi bellowed, we’d pushed well beyond the boundaries of his patience, and he was quite done with the shouting match.

“Quinn,” he commanded, holding out a hand, which Quinn then placed the document in.

The King examined the paper, then spoke, “Michael, the document is genuine, and Lady Victorina is correct. I’ve had quite enough of this argument, Quinn, your bursary is your own to control.”

“Thank you, Your Majesty,” Quinn nodded.

Lord Walsh, *Michael?* seemed to search for something to latch on to, before finally finding it, “So you think you’re a better Mage than my son Quinn?”

“Michael…” came the warning from King Nezzabi, he clearly wanted this to be done with.

Lord Walsh raised his hands, “There’s a point sir, I promise. How about this, if you’re so good, then you match against Andy in the arena. There’s a big tournament at the start of each semester, you fight then. If you win, I’ll let you keep your bursary. If Andy wins, you have to do what I damn well tell you to. That seems only fair doesn’t it?” Lord Walsh asked, as he looked to King Nezzabi.

*I really hope that Nezzabi doesn’t just execute us all to shut us up.*

“No,” Quinn said, standing up, “I’m not making any such agreement. You’re going to leave me, and my money alone, and I will do exactly as I like.”

It was only a deathly look from King Nezzabi that kept Lord Walsh from exploding at his nephew, and Quinn stepped between Lord Walsh and Andrew to stand before the King.

He bowed, brought one hand to his chest, and spoke, “Your Excellency, I was honoured to be presented with your gracious offer, and I understand the magnitude of just what it means to be presented with such a chance. It is only because I fear myself unsuitable that I cannot accept it. His Lordship can furnish a greater explanation if you require it, but my vision is so poor as to render me all but blind on the battlefield, and due to an extended period spent wearing Adympian slave manacles, I’m afraid I’ve lost the use of both hands. It is only through my meagre magical talent, such as you saw when I gave you the scroll, that I can see to my own needs at all. Your offer honours me, though I fear that I would not be able to serve you as capably as another might, so I cannot in good conscience accept your prestigious offer. I also apologize for the altercation just now, and I take full responsibility, I assure you that it will not happen again. I hope that I have not offended you too greatly, and I beg your forgiveness.”

*Excellency. That’s a new one.*

There was a beat, as we each took a moment to process Quinn’s little speech. I was worried, at first, that he would take it too far. Despite the purple and indigo he seemed to lack some of the experience that I’d expect from the son of an imperial family. Nobles, royalty, and King Nezzabi in particular, were quite susceptible to flattery, but it would have only made matters worse if Quinn had overdone it. It seemed that he’d come down on the right side of ‘excessive’ though, and it’s likely that the bill of pedigree, and general confusion, helped smooth out any bumps that were due to Quinn’s inexperience.

I didn’t have any idea what King Nezzabi had offered Quinn, and probably neither did King Nezzabi, but it didn’t really matter.

“I suppose I can be reasonable,” King Nezzabi said graciously, “It’s understandable that such a meeting after so long apart might cause us all to get a little… excited,” and he returned the bill of pedigree, which was taken up by an invisible hand and stowed back in Quinn’s belt.

It was only after putting away the document that Quinn straightened from his bow, “Your Excellency, if I may take my leave, I do not wish to cause you further trouble.”

“Of course,” King Nezzabi said, even with the flattery, he was clearly ready to rid himself of the cause of the mess as quickly as possible.

I took my leave as well, and turned to look back, just in time to catch the questioning look that the King gave Lord Walsh. I could imagine the unspoken question, *I offered him what exactly?*

-----

“He offered you what exactly?” I asked Quinn, once we were safely back in the carriage and rolling away.

“Uncle Walsh seemed to want me to stay at the castle, and assist… I don’t know, the family I guess. Well I tried to avoid giving a specific answer, I sure as hell wasn’t about to leave the University, but I didn’t want to give a flat out denial. Well, we all got talking, and General Atrar seemed to like what I had to say. It helped that Uncle Walsh was talking me up a bit to the Generals, he made a point as to how skilled a tactician and strategist I was.”

“Are you a skilled tactician and strategist?” I asked sceptically.

“Probably more than most lay people, but no, not really. The ‘examples’ he gave of my military cleverness were from videogames I’d played against his sons. Never mind the fact that I got the shit put to me by his kids whenever I **did** pull any cleverness against them, but he represented it as if it were reality.”

“Videogames, you said that several of the University’s games are comparable?” I asked.

“Yeah, so you can see how this was a problem for me. Well General Atrar liked what Uncle Walsh had to say, and said that since I was going to be staying at the castle, that I’d make a rather good adjutant. Well Uncle Walsh seized upon this, and said that I could leave next week, apparently General Atrar is going off on some sort of exercise, and this would be a chance for me to get used to the position outside of actual fighting.”

“General Atrar offered to make you his adjutant? Quinn, not that I object, I don’t want you to leave the club, but do you know just what General Atrar was offering you?” I asked, a little shocked.

“Yeah, I’ve got a fairly good idea. But I just about killed myself to get here, and I didn’t come all this way to be a damned General, I came all this way to be a Mage,” he said with conviction, “So that’s when I did need to give a flat out refusal. I don’t even think that it was turning down the adjutancy that pissed off my Uncle, I think the problem was that I contradicted him in front of the Generals. But he’d already decided, for himself, for me, and for the generals, that I was going to do thing A. And I told him that I’d be doing thing B instead. It didn’t matter what the hell A and B were, only that he’d already made up his mind on me doing A.”

“I’m sorry things didn’t work out with your family Quinn,” I said.

Quinn sighed, “It’s fine, it’s not your fault. If the meeting was under different circumstances, or if I’d made my position clear as soon as possible, maybe things would have gone okay. Uncle Walsh probably still would have been unhappy, but it wouldn’t have blown up like this. That was my own fault though, I’m sorry if I messed things up with Nezzabi for you.”

“No,” I said, rubbing at my forehead, “There’s an entirely different mess there, entirely of my own creation.”

“Want to tell me about it?” He laughed.

And I did.

# Chapter 33

Victorina

-----

“So... There’s an imminent succession crisis in Adympia, and you’re one of only two people with any sort of claim on the throne,” Quinn summarized.

“Yes,” I nodded.

“And that means that nearly every interested party is going to be trying to get their hands on you. Is there anything else we need to worry about?” Quinn asked wryly.

“Well, we might also be about to lose nearly half of our club members.”

“Oh, that’s all? What a relief, I thought that we might really be in trouble for a moment there,” he deadpanned.

I rubbed at my eyes with one hand, I could feel the headache coming on. I’d made preparations to guard against losing members, but it would be a lot harder to implement the plan now that I also had to worry about getting carried off back to Adympia.

“Sorry, I didn’t mean it like that,” Quinn said.

I sighed, “It’s fine, its just a lot to handle all at once.”

“Yeah, I can imagine. How much longer does your father have anyways?” He asked.

“You mean before he dies?” I asked, and Quinn nodded, “Well, that is the big question isn’t it. Under normal circumstances I’d say that it wasn’t really a concern, he has longevity spells cast on him yearly, and I don’t think that he’s fallen ill.”   

“Well then, what if someone cut off your dad’s access to whichever Mage is casting the spell for him?”

“He’d still probably live for another two hundred years at least, physically he’s still only thirty years old or so,” I rubbed at my eyes again, “It doesn’t make much sense, unless whoever killed my brothers is about to follow it up with an assassination attempt on my father. That’s even assuming that they can get close enough, and my father’s been dodging assassination attempts since he was my age. It doesn’t seem like a plan that was put together very well,” I sighed, “It’s quite inconvenient for me though.”

“It might have been a crime of opportunity, maybe the culprit saw their chance, and took it, without thinking too much about what step two would be,” Quinn surmised.

“I suppose, it still seems like we’re missing some piece of the puzzle though. Why warn myself and my father by killing my brothers now? Now I know to be on my guard, and my father is likely to be spending a great deal of time with his concubines.”

“Concubines? As in, plural?” Quinn asked, eyebrow raised.

“Yes, is that uncommon for Earth royalty?” I asked, beyond Quinn’s impromptu history lesson I knew little about Earth’s customs.

“Yeah, at least it is for European royalty, they don’t keep concubines. Mistresses, definitely, but then Kings or Emperors wouldn’t go around advertising the fact that they keep mistresses. Are the children of concubines valid heirs?”

“Yes, though they automatically come after any of the wife’s children in the line of succession. My father never married though, he keeps only concubines,” I explained.

“Well, not to be crude,” Quinn said, “But it sounds like he’s going to have his replacement heir within a year or so. Maybe even multiple heirs.”

I shook my head, “I don’t know how it is for humans, but my father usually keeps anywhere between three and five concubines. Even then, he only has a new child about once every ten or so years. The fact that Oppius and Jula were born so close together was seen as a miracle, and they were still seven years apart in age.”

“Hmmm,” Quinn considered, “Maybe I’m looking at this with too human a perspective then. If this were a human plot then I’d expect it all to happen at once, but with the timescales that elves seem to work on, it seems that the culprit has some time to work with. Even still, it seems poorly put together, since your father has just as much time to formulate a response.”

I nodded, “Even a babe, so long as it was male, might be enough to stabilize things. It would certainly not be ideal, but the more conservative factions would be happy support the status quo, rather than an usurper.”

“Hold on…” Quinn said, “What if alerting your father is exactly what they wanted to do?”

“What do you mean?” I asked, giving him the side eye, “I don’t see how that helps anyone other than my father.”

“Well you said that your father keeps between three and five concubines, right? Well, is that a hard and fast limit?” He asked, leaning forwards in the small space of the carriage.

“No, but more is generally seen as indulgent. Even five is considered somewhat indecent, though you do make a good point. I expect that my father will forego appearances if it means that he can produce a male heir more quickly. Even the more conservative vassals are likely to look the other way, if it means that the status quo is supported.”

“Exactly. So your father loses both of his heirs, and needs new ones, so he takes some more concubines. Maybe a lot more, because he’s not sure how long it’s going to be before the assassins get to him. After all, if they could get to his sons, they might be able to get to him as well. So he pushes the bounds of decency as far as he can afford to…”

My eyes widened, as I realized the point Quinn was coming to, “And the culprit has seen to it that one of the women my father might take as a concubine, is in fact loyal to the conspiracy.”

“Yeah, and probably not just one of the women. It might even be the case that **most** of them are compromised. I don’t know how well contraceptives are understood in Elardia, but I’d expect that any of the concubines that are in on the plot, are also going to be trying to slip the others… I don’t know, something, to ensure that none of the honest concubines bear an heir.”

*Honest concubines? That might be an oxymoron.*

“That’s not much consolation for me though,” I said grimly, “Anyone not in the conspiracy is still going to want to get their hands on me, they’re not just going to sit by and let someone else steal the throne, when they could have it for themselves.”

“You might still need to contend with the conspirators,” Quinn pointed out, “Even if it’s just to prevent the sort of situation that you just outlined.”

I groaned, leaning back to look up at the ceiling of the carriage, “I do not need this right now.”

“Right,” Quinn said, “You said that we might lose some people, can we take steps to avoid that? I’d rather be at full strength if we’ve got to fight off some Adympian asshole that comes along to collect you. How would that work anyway, and who would we be losing?”

“Ken and Halea, they’re probably going to be called home by their parents, and according to King Nezzabi it’ll be some time during the coming semester. At least, their parents are going to try to call them home, I have been preparing for this after all,” I explained, “I’m guessing that Ken and Halea’s parents have something in mind for their daughters, a marriage agreement or some such thing. In theory, the two of them could simply refuse to return home, but in practice it’s more complicated.”

“Their parents could cut them off from their bursaries, just as my Uncle tried to,” Quinn said, nodding in understanding, “Assuming the money thing is sorted out, do we need to worry about the University just giving them the boot? Actually, do Ken and Halea even want to stay? For all I know they might not mind returning home.”

“They do mind,” I snapped, “That’s why they’re here with me, and not at one of the club or guilds that treats the University like it’s some sort of damned finishing school.”

Quinn raised his hands in surrender, “Whoa, I get it Victorina, I just wanted to make sure that they were on board.”

I took a deep breath, “Sorry Quinn, as you can imagine, it’s a touchy subject. And no, the University will cooperate by cutting off the bursary, but that is all they’ll do. Of course, their parents might make things difficult for the two of them, or even all of us, politically.”

“I take it that the others knew that was a possibility when they joined up?” Quinn asked, and I nodded, a little guiltily, “Well, I can put up with a little political dickery. What about the money thing then? I’m guessing that most of the club members have been saving most of the money they’ve been earning?”

“Yes…” I said, *dammit, I should have told him sooner,* “Though they’ve not been taking in quite as much as you’ve been.”

“What do you mean?” He asked, brows furrowing, “Neferoy’s the only one that’s not a six or higher. The rest should have the same bursary that I do.”

I looked down at the floor of the carriage, “I shouldn’t have waited so long to tell you, but most of the club isn’t receiving their full bursary. Their parents keep most of it, and only pay back a small portion as spending money.”

“Why would that be-“ Quinn started to say, before he got it “Oh.”

“Yes,” I said guiltily.

“So that’s the other reason you were so willing to take me,” he said, clearly irritated, “You were pretty sure that I’d be able to bring in a great deal of money for the club, which could then be paid back to the others if something like this came up. That’s another reason for you going to the trouble of looking for Outsiders, like Brandy, when they get dropped off by Banestorms.”

“Yes. I’m sorry I wasn’t honest with you Quinn. And I would understand,” I started hesitantly, “If you wanted me to return-“

He waved one hand, “I really wish you would have just told me, if not on day one then at least sooner, but I don’t want the money back. You know, I would have said yes if you’d just asked me in the first palce.”

I nodded, “I know that now that I’ve gotten to know you better, and I apologize, I’m just not used to getting help like that without some significant strings attached.”

“Like Nezzabi’s offer of help for example,” Quinn said wryly.

“Yeah,” I huffed out a breath, “exactly like that.”

“Well since we’re being honest with each other,” Quinn started, “I supposed it’s only fair to let you know that the whole Adympian succession crisis thing might be partially, sort of, maybe, a little bit, kinda, my fault.”

“What?” I exclaimed, “How?”

Quinn grimaced, “I’d need to know more about the symptoms of the poisoning, but it sounds rather like Ricin, and as far as I know, no elf knows how to create it. When I was in Ventia, that was the city in Admypia where I got… held up, I was working for a Lady Chypia. She had an elder sister who was a Mage, and that sister was in the hands of the then heir to the Marquiship of Ventia. In my attempt to get into her good graces, I offered her a way to free her sister, kill her captor, and possibly even claim the Marquiship for herself. She happened to be the next in line after the current heir,” Quinn explained, “So I synthesized some Ricin, and designed a weapon to discreetly fire a small wooden needle soaked with the poison. I left before the plan was put into practice, but I left her with a working weapon, and five such needles.”

I sighed heavily, “Quite the mess you’ve created Quinn.”

“Sorry about your brothers,” Quinn said quietly, “I probably should have thought things through before leaving Chypia with what might be the best nonmagical assassination weapon on the planet. That was definitely a fuck up.”

I shook my head, “You couldn’t have known, and besides, it’s not as if my brothers don’t deserve it. I’m pretty sure both of them have tried to kill me more than once, on orders from my father, and they keep Mages of their own as playthings. They are, or were, sick men, and I’m not about to shed a tear for either of them. You’ve certainly made my life more difficult though, and I’m still wondering why.”

“Why I made your life more difficult?” Quinn asked, with an amused expression, “Trust me, that was an accident. At least in this case, I can’t make any promises going forwards.”

I swatted him in the shoulder, “No you oaf, why would she want to kill my brothers? What does she stand to gain? Even if she is the Marques, that doesn’t put her anywhere near being able to seize the Imperial throne. And if anyone looks into just how she came into her new position, they’re likely to see the similarities in the way that the Marquis and my brothers died.”

He shrugged, “I don’t know, that’s even assuming she succeeded. Maybe someone else got ahold of the weapon and the poison. I’ve not heard anything from Ventia since arriving here, granted, I haven’t heard anything from much of anywhere. I’ve spent most of my time holed up in the library. It might be the case that someone else has got the weapon and the poison.”

“I’ll see what I can find out,” I said, “And thank you for telling me Quinn, I do appreciate it.”

“You’re welcome,” he nodded, a little sheepishly.

“Just warn me before you start another succession crisis.”

-----

“What about the money thing,” Quinn asked, “How do things look there?”

We’d made the teleport back to the University a little while ago, and had hired a new carriage to take us to a glassblower. Quinn had mentioned that he’d need proper vision for the coming tournament, and for whatever challenges we might face from Adympia. He had not seemed optimistic about the glassblower as a solution, but had said that he needed to “Explore all avenues of success.”

“You, Neferoy, Brandy, and myself, all get our full bursary, and we’re all paying in half of what we get to the club. Ken and Halea only get enough back from their families to support themselves, so they keep all of it, and save as much as they can. Minki is in a similar situation, she only gets about as much as Halea does, but her parents pay the club half of her bursary regardless. She managed to convince them that it was for ‘club dues’, which is a big help. We’d be cutting things very close if we suddenly had to start paying money back to Halea, Ken, and Minki, but it would be doable. Mostly.”

“Mostly?” Quinn asked.

“Neferoy’s family fully supports her endeavours. There are so few dwarves Mages born, that whatever they might think about the proper role of a woman, they’re willing to overlook it in the case of Neferoy. We’re not going to lose her any time soon. The problem is that Minki’s parents are probably going to get wise once they realize just what it is I’m doing.”

“Ah, I see,” Quinn nodded, “Halea’s parents get word that Halea is staying, and that the club is supporting her monetarily. They let Minki’s parents know, Minki’s parents stop paying ‘dues’, and maybe even try to call her home immediately.”

“Yes. And we can manage that, though it would mean that the rest of us would need to pay in a larger portion of our bursaries.”

“That’s no trouble,” Quinn reassured me, “I’ve also got quite a bit in the bank from the bounty on those slave cuffs, so I can help out with that as well. You mentioned the political ramifications though, what have we got to contend with there?”

“Well, that is the problem isn’t it. If the Tanaka family was so inclined, they could raise the rent on the clubhouse to the point where we couldn’t afford to keep it. The club has savings, especially if you’re going to chip in with that bounty, however…” I trailed off.

“It’s not sustainable,” Quinn finished.

“Exactly.”

“How much of a hardship is that really though? Why not just find somewhere cheaper? I love the clubhouse, but if we need to find something more affordable then I can put up with that.”

“It would be a temporary solution at best, maybe not even that,” I explained, “It’s very expensive to live anywhere within the University, and even living elsewhere in the city would be pricy.”

“Ah, and all it takes is a message from any one of three pissed off families to make it even more expensive to live there, expensive enough that we’d find ourselves in the same position anyways.”

“Yes, and they might just kick us out. That’s most of the reason we stay in the Tanka’s clubhouse. It is expensive, but I’ve got a proper lease agreement with them. There are limits on just how quickly they can raise our rent, and they cannot simply evict us.”

“So even though the Tanaka clubhouse is the more expensive, its also more secure,” Quinn nodded.

“Exactly,” I confirmed, “Especially since the Tanaka family is not particularly fond of Minki’s family. It might make rent a touch more expensive, but it also means that the Tanakas will be less willing to do what Minki’s father asks.”

“Why don’t they like each other?” Quinn asked.

“Minki’s father is an Archduke in Karka, and the Tanakas hold one of the kingdoms in Ashur. They border each other, and there’s some sort of disagreement over just where that border lies.”

“The Tanakas might be willing to listen to Halea’s or Ken’s parents though, wouldn’t they?” Quinn asked.

I nodded, “Yes, so it’s far from a perfect solution, but of all the possibilities, this is the clubhouse we can keep our hands on the longest. Once we lose it though…”

“We might not find another,” Quinn said grimly.

“Yes. While that wouldn’t be the end of the world, it would certainly make life difficult for all of us.”

“If we don’t have a clubhouse, does that dissolve the club?” Quinn asked with concern.

“No, we’d just meet somewhere else instead, but it would still leave us each with the difficulty of finding somewhere to stay.”

“Right, which still might be difficult if the rather disgruntled families decide to keep up the economic pressure. Alright so let’s assume that we’re going to get kicked out of the clubhouse, because however the Tanakas feel about Minki’s family, it’s going to happen eventually. So in whatever time the rivalry buys us, just what are we going to do?”

I sighed, “We seek the support of one of the guilds. We’re all quite talented, and we represent more than half of the Mages above the sixth level of talent at the University. Any guild would be glad to have such a concentration of talent among their ranks, especially since some of the guilds don’t even have one such Mage among their numbers.”

“I’m sensing some reservations about this plan,” Quinn noted, “What’s the downside?”

“The leadership of the guild, whatever guild that might be, would have certain ‘expectations’ of us. After all,” I said sarcastically, “It’s only through their good graces that we’d be able to stay at the university, they’d **deserve** our ‘gratitude’.”

“And that’s the sort of thing you’ve been trying to avoid in the first place,” Quinn acknowledged.

“I’m probably being too harsh, not everyone in guild leadership is a lecherous bastard, its just...” I sighed, running my hands through my hair.

“You shouldn’t need to be on your guard all the time in your own home,” Quinn finished, “Which was the whole reason for having an all female club.”

“Yes.”

“Is there a plan B?” He asked.

“I don’t know. I really don’t know. I’ve been looking around, and pretty much every single inch of land anywhere in the University or the city is owned either by a noble family of one rank or another, or by one of the guilds.”

“Live outside the city?” Quinn suggested, “Maybe we could set up a teleport beacon, and use it to jump to the one back there.” Quinn said, pointing a thumb back the way we’d come.

“Well then we’d be in guild held lands anyways. You’ve probably heard that the guild hierarchs are each about equivalent to a Count, maybe a little higher. Well, all of the counties around the city are held directly by one of the guilds. The only place that’s really ‘free’ is the land to the north of the University, and that’s still technically held by the twelfth guild. We couldn’t just build a shack there and call it ours.”

“Twelfth guild?” Quinn asked, clearly interested.

“’The cursed guild’” I said wryly, “No one holds it, and so no one technically controls their lands. That still doesn’t mean we can build there though, since we’d need permission to do so, and since no one holds it, there’s no one to ask for permission.”

Quinn started grinning like a child the moment I started explaining, “I don’t suppose that the person or people to lift the curse are then able to claim the guild?” Quinn asked excitedly.

“Yes…” I said warily, *I don’t like where this is going.*

“Well, there we go then,” Quinn said confidently, “All we need to do is lift the curse.”

I just put my head in my hands.

“What?” Quinn asked defensively, “It seems like a perfectly reasonable solution. We’d have a place to stay, which seems like the biggest hurdle, and we’d have whatever incomes that the guild’s land would bring in. There’s money solved too.”

“The guild has been abandoned for nearly two thousand years, do you really think that we’re going to be the ones to lift it?” I asked, exasperated, “Two thousand years of Mages trying it, and you’re going to be the one to finally succeed?”

*And I thought that Andrew was arrogant.*

“That’s, what… five hundred years in human years. Besides, I think we’ve actually got a couple advantages,” Quinn said, still with that silly smile.

“What, we’ve got you?” I said sarcastically.

“Well that’s obviously one of them,” he said, *obviously,* “But the other is this club you’ve created. If I remember correctly, there are only twelve Mages at the University right now with a talent of six or more, right?” he asked, and I nodded, “Well we have half of them, and the other six are all split between multiple clubs.”

“Multiple **guilds** actually,” I said, “But what’s the point?”

“Well there you go. I bet that this spreading out of talent was also the case historically, wasn’t it?” Quinn asked, “Each guild did their damnedest to bring talented Mages to their side, which naturally spread out the talent. Competition was so fierce that any one guild could only justify spending so much of their resources to entice such a small number Mages. You’ve probably created the single greatest concentration of talent that has existed in quite some time, wouldn’t you agree?”

“Sure,” I said hesitantly, “Where are you going with this?”

“It might even be,” he said grinning, “The highest concentration of talented Mages in, say, two thousand years?”

“That sounds a little farfetched,” I said, *on the other hand…*

“Hey, maybe? But I bet if you checked the records that you’d see that I’m not too far off. So we’ve probably got more talented Mages than anyone else that’s tried this, and we’ve got Brandy and I.”

“And how do you two help?” I asked, Quinn hadn’t been rude to Brandy, but I could tell that he didn’t exactly consider her a titan of intellect.

“Well there have probably been other human Outsiders in those past two thousand years, but they would have lacked even the level of education that Brandy has. Hell, go back even a hundred years, and ninety percent of the people that get picked up wouldn’t know much more than an elf peasant,” he explained, “Elves seem to advance rather slowly when it comes to technology, probably something to do with the abundance of magic and the much longer lifespans. Humans though, we advance very quickly technologically speaking. King Nezzabi has been ruling for a couple hundred years. Go back a couple hundred years on Earth, and my country wouldn’t even exist.”

“Really?” I asked, surprised, “How does that help us though?”

“Well Brandy and I are both better educated than anyone that might have tried to lift the curse before us, including other humans. There have been other Mages as talented as the two of us, but none with the same background knowledge to guide our application of that knowledge. We’re also supported by one of the greatest clubs that have ever been created,” he said, with a small smile.

“Flattery?” I asked, pursing my lips, “Really?”

“Is it working?” He laughed, “Anyway, most educated, best club, combine those, and I think we actually can come up with something brand new to try. And it will need to be something new. If it’s not new then it’s been tried, and if it’s been tried, then it clearly hasn’t worked.”

“I hope you’re right Quinn,” I said quietly, “I really hope you’re right.”

-----

We stopped by the glassblower, several actually, since Quinn didn’t seem satisfied with the quality of most of the samples we saw. We eventually found a shop that produced their glass with the help of a fire mage, and this seemed to be enough for Quinn. He bought nearly fifty pounds of glass in various thicknesses, and tucked it all away into his extra-dimensional handkerchief.

“Quinn,” I asked, a little alarmed, “Do you have a stove in there?”

“Yeah, some counter space, a freezer, and a fridge too,” he said, as he folded up the piece of cloth.

“Why?” I asked, peering up at him with confusion.

“Why not?” He said, seeming taken aback, “I like cooking.”

“You know we have all that at the clubhouse, don’t you?”

“Sure, but what if we take a trip somewhere? What if we need to go on some grand adventure off in the wilderness? Now we’ll have proper food along the way. I’ve even got most of an infirmary in there too.”

“Doesn’t that seem a little excessive?” I asked, quite bemused.

“Maybe,” he said, frowning, “The kitchen might be a bit much, but the medical supplies? No. With something like the portable hole or the utility belt, being unprepared is hard to excuse. If someone was badly injured, and I didn’t have the supplies ready to help them, and they died because of that… well I wouldn’t be able to forgive myself. Not when it would have been so easy to bring along whatever I might have needed. The rest is just an extension of that same way of thinking. I’ve got food stored away in the fridge and the freezer, and a few other choice items that might come in handy in an emergency.”

“I think I can understand that,” I nodded, “Will you be cooking tonight then?”

“Sure,” he smiled, “I’ve even got plans for desert.”

# Chapter 34

Quinn

-----

I didn’t have much time that afternoon to experiment with glasses, Neferoy did promise her help as soon as she had a free moment, but we both spent the rest of the day in the sitting room with the rest of the club. Victorina needed to brief the others on just what we’d learned from our meeting with Nezzabi, and we needed to plan. We weren’t in too terrible a shape, and according to Ken’s budgeting, we’d actually be fine as long as the Tanaka family didn’t hike the rent on us. That couldn’t be counted on though, and once the rent did get raised we’d only have so much time. Between the savings Victorina had assembled over the years, and my own savings from the sale of the cuffs, we figured that we probably had about a year of leeway. Either of us could keep us going much longer off of savings, but like I’d observed earlier, it simply wasn’t sustainable. We’d still need a solution eventually, and burning through all of our savings would make finding and taking advantage of that solution much more difficult, on the off chance my plan to lift a thousand year old curse didn’t work out.

“Just how is the guildhall cursed anyway?” I asked absently.

“Wait, you don’t know?” Ken asked sharply.

“No,” I said shaking my head, “What’s wrong with the guildhall?”

Ken just put her face in her hands, “I thought you said that we might be able to lift the curse Quinn,” she grumbled.

“And we can,” I said brightly.

“I thought he already had a plan, Vicky!” Ken exclaimed, looking to Victorina.

“It’s a work in progress,” I said defensively, “I’ve only been on the case for a couple of hours.”

“I know you’re like, smart and stuff, but this seems like it’d be really hard,” Brandy said, “Maybe we should try something easier.”

“And we are going to do that too, but we’ve got a better chance of success if we attack the problem from multiple angles. One of those angles is trying to lift the curse. It’s like I told Victorina earlier, whatever we do to lift the curse will need to be something brand new, since most stuff will have been tried in the past thousand years. Well the two of us **are** new, there may have been other humans to try to lift the curse, but we’re probably the first from the twenty-first century to try it.”

Brandy perked up, “So we’re going to use science and stuff?”

“That’s the plan,” I said, “So, just how is the guildhall cursed?”

The others didn’t seem to quite get why Brandy was suddenly on board, but Ken didn’t put up any further fuss.

Neferoy was the one to speak, and I still found myself wishing that she had a Scottish accent, “The Prefecture of Ariros, that’s what the guild was called before it was dissolved, were some of the first people to start experimenting with Time magic-“

“**Time** magic?” I cut in.

Neferoy nodded.

“Damn, well that sounds like a really terrible idea,” I said flatly.

“Yes,” Neferoy smiled, “Hence the thousand year curse. The spells they were experimenting with were relatively simple, at least as time magic goes, there was very little existing literature on Time magic at that… time. There’s actually still very little, since getting permission to experiment with it is nearly impossible, and those who do already have the information aren’t keen to share it. Anyway, the point is that they were experimenting with a spell to freeze the passage of time in an area.”

“A stasis spell,” I provided.

“Exactly,” she confirmed, “There’s some rumours about just what they were planning on using the spell for, it may have simply been a stepping stone onto their next experiment, but there are very few specifics after so much time. In any case, the rumours say that the problems came about during their first test on an elf. Supposedly they’d already tried the spell on inert objects and animals, and found it safe.”

“Just a shot in the dark here, but I’m guessing that it wasn’t in fact safe?” I asked,

“You’d be right. The rumours differ on just who the enchantment was tested on,” She started.

“Sorry, enchantment?” I asked.

She nodded, “It was thought, again, according to rumour and legend, that an enchantment would be more stable than simply casting it as a spell. That does have some truth to it, enchantments are a bit more stable, but personally I think that it was cast as an enchantment so they could better supply energy to the spell. I don’t know how much you’ve read on enchantments, but once enchantments are cast they can draw directly from ambient mana. It’s not always enough to support the enchantment fully, but I can only imagine that Time spells must draw a great deal of energy, and casting it as an enchantment probably helped a great deal since they would have needed to provide less external mana.”

I nodded along with her explanation, *I’ll be filing that away for later.*

“Ah, where was I?” She asked, tilting her head to one side.

“You were just telling us who the enchantment was tested on,” I provided, “Or at least, you were telling me.”

“Right, there’s a great deal of disagreement on just who it was. We know for sure that the elf was a woman, and that she was relatively powerful as a Mage. The controversy is just what role she held in the guild. The conventional view is that she was a notable member due to her level of talent, but that she held no political power within the guild. Some instead claim that she was in fact on the guild council, and yet others claim that she was in fact the guild hierarch’s kept woman.”

I raised an eyebrow, “Really, hmm, well which do you think it is?”

Neferoy shrugged her broad shoulders, “I’m pretty sure I know which story Halea and Thera like the best,” she smirked, looking over at where the two sat, “But it’s too hard to say for sure. Too much of the discussion breaks down to what the people involved believe the role of a woman is.”

I nodded, “I can imagine. So, what happened to her? And how did that lead to a big curse? Did she get horribly disfigured, and in turn curse the guild with ten thousand years of back luck?”

“No,” Neferoy said, “She died.”

“What? How did some stasis field spell kill her?” I asked, “Did it make time flow more quickly? Did she die of old age?” *That doesn’t make sense though, she should have been immortal like the rest of the Mages here.*

“I don’t really know,” Neferoy replied, “I think, **Quinn**, that if someone had figured it out, then they would have been able to raise the curse by now.”

“It’s a work in progress,” I said flippantly, “How does dead Mage turn into horrible thousand year curse then?”

“Well if you’d stop interrupting me, then I’d tell you,” She said pointedly, “Her spirit returned as a wraith. It’s rare for a Mage to become a wraith, if we do return we usually return as a ghost, but when a Mage does return as a wraith then it is a damned big problem.”

I opened my mouth to speak, but Neferoy seemed to anticipate my question, “Ghosts retain their intelligence, wraiths do not. However, wraith or ghost, when Mages come back, we can still use our magic.”

“That does sound like an incredible problem, but not a thousand year problem. Is killing a wraith really that hard?”

Neferoy looked to Halea, who piped up, “Killing a wraith, or, destroying I guess, is very hard. You’re right though, it’s not a problem that should take a thousand years. She manifested immediately though, which probably didn’t help the original guild members.”

I raised an eyebrow, and Neferoy filled me in, “Most wraiths or ghosts can take months or years to manifest for the first time, but according to what I’ve heard and read, her wraith manifested almost the instant that the enchantment was raised.”

“Crazed wraith, big group of distracted and disoriented Mages…” I noted.

“Yes,” Neferoy said, “She killed almost half of the guild’s leadership, and a great number of their skilled Mages, before they could rally and fight her off long enough to escape. They tried to go back in some time after to reclaim their guildhall. They’d gathered their remaining members, and they made every preparation that they could think of to ready themselves for the fight. They lost nearly as many members in that second fight, as they had in the first.”

“What makes her so much more dangerous than a normal wraith then? Are all spellcasting wraiths so hard to destroy?” I asked, trying to piece this together.

Neferoy shook her head, “No, and they **did** destroy her, multiple times even. That is where the problem lies, when destroyed she remanifested almost instantaneously. They killed it as many as a hundred times, if the most fanciful reports are to be believed, and every time it returned to attack them. The admittance records I’ve seen from that period suggest that The Prefecture of Ariros had as many as one hundred and fifty members before they tested the stasis enchantment, and as few as forty after their failed attempt to reclaim the guildhall. Included among the casualties were the guild hierarch, and the entirety of the guild council.”

“I’m guessing that there have been at least a few attempts in the same vein since then?” I asked.

“Mmm hmm, other clubs and other guilds have sent groups of battlemages in, as recently as last year. They have seen some minor success, but it has been minor. The wraith does seem more, normal? Though that’s not really the right word,” Neferoy said, trying to sort out the proper way to explain things.

“What do you mean, ‘normal’, is it less powerful now than it was before?” I asked.

Neferoy gestured to Halea, who picked up the explanation, ”Most wraiths don’t interact with the physical world constantly, which is what the Ariros wraith seemed to do in the first few years after the curse. Normally a wraith needs to bide it’s time. They’re a lot like ghosts, they spend most of their time immaterial, and only barely visible. To be able to manifest they need to gather energy of some sort. Ghosts, especially ghosts of Mages, do this by drawing on ambient mana. Wraiths on the other hand, draw upon the life of other creatures. If a wraith is present, but not manifesting, then it’s much less dangerous. Even one that has magic won’t be able to affect you with it. The main concern then is that it will draw enough energy from your presence to allow it to manifest.”

“And then you’re partially drained, facing a pissed off and charged up wraith, that in this case also has magical abilities,” I concluded.

“Yeah. And the Ariros wraith’s ability to manifest constantly made it incredibly dangerous,” Halea explained, “Whatever they did with the Time enchantment to cause her spirit to return as a wraith, also granted that wraith a great deal of power to draw upon. From what I’ve heard it’s used up those reserves, and instead needs to rely on power taken from people and animals to manifest, just as with any other wraith. Unlike any other wraith though, it’s never stayed destroyed, so that much hasn’t changed.”

“So, let’s say we walk in today. Does it have enough energy stored to manifest as soon as we walk through the door? How long would it take to pull energy off of us so that it could?” I asked.

I had an outline of a plan, but there was still a great deal that I was missing.

“It probably doesn’t have enough stored up, and besides, a wraith isn’t sentient anyways, so it’s not always clever enough to know to save its power for later. The university has also gotten better at keeping animals away from the guildhall, so really all it can to draw from are foolish students. Assuming no one’s been in for a while, it would have almost no energy stored. It might take… oh, ten minutes, to draw enough energy to manifest.”

“Foolish students? You mean other groups going in to lift the curse?”

“Some,” Halea acknowledged, “But mostly it’s people going in to try to recover texts or artefacts.”

“Looters.” I stated.

“Well, yes,” Halea conceded, “It’s a rather popular ‘adventure’ though. Every so often a few Mages will get together to see what they can grab from the library or one of the labs, in the time before the wraith manifests.”

“I take it that the University as an organization isn’t a fan of this sort of thing?” I asked.

“Very much no,” Victorina said, and then continued in a warning tone, “Now Quinn…”

“Well we’d have to go in to lift the curse anyway,” I said reasonably, in response to her warning look, “It might be good to get a look around, and I’d need some more information anyways.”

“Like what?” Victorina sighed, making a mess of her hair with both hands.

“Two things come to mind immediately. First, is the stasis spell still up? Second, why are wraiths non-sentient, while ghosts are? Though I’d not need to go in to get the answer to that second one.”

“Well I can answer both of those for you right now,” Neferoy said, “The stasis spell is still up, and wraiths are non-sentient because they’re incomplete. A ghost is essentially a soul without a body, and a wraith is a fragmented soul without a body.”

*A soul without a body you say?*

“And the stasis field, it’s still up? After all this time? Has no one been able to bring it down?” I asked.

“I’d need to double check,” Neferoy said, “I haven’t read some of this material since I first arrived at the University, I was as interested then as you are now in lifting the curse, but I believe that it has occasionally been disabled temporarily. I think it’s only been done once or twice though. I’m guessing that they thought the removal of the stasis enchantment might help break the curse, and to some extent it did, though only briefly. In the case I read the wraith was drawn to the group of Mages almost the instant that they neared the body and the stasis field. They were ready for this though, and managed to keep the wraith off long enough to dispel the enchantment. The wraith wasn’t destroyed permanently, as they’d hoped, but it was distracted when the stasis enchantment was lowered. Not for long though, because in under a minute the enchantment had reasserted itself and the wraith returned to attacking them.”

“Why haven’t more people tried to dispel the enchantment?” I asked, frowning in thought, “Seems like that got closer than anything else at solving the problem.”

“It’s damned hard,” Neferoy replied, “Countering any spell is hard enough, dispelling an enchantment is even more difficult, and in both cases you need to know the spell or enchantment in great detail. Which as you can imagine is difficult because…”

“Time spells are so closely guarded and tightly controlled,” I completed, “Hold on, you said it was drawn to them once they approached the stasis field, does it not attack if you keep away from the field?”

“No,” Halea shook her head, “The wraith will seek out anyone that enters the guildhall, though it doesn’t know immediately where the intruders are, only that they are present within the building. Like all wraiths it’s drawn to life so that it might destroy it, so it’s not as simple as trying to avoid antagonizing it. All that getting near to the stasis enchantment does is give the wraith a better idea of where you are.”

“Hence the smash and grab looting parties, if they’re quick enough they might even get out before the wraith tracks them down,” I surmised.

“Yes, the guild hall is certainly large enough,” Victorina nodded, “But I imagine that they’d object to the term ‘smash, and grab’. Most of the people foolish enough to do such a thing are upper or middle class.”

*I guess peasants are smart enough not to fuck with immortal magical killing machines.*

I shrugged, “So it’s a well-dressed smash and grab. What about this thing with the wraith, why are they drawn to destroy life? Or is this one of those questions that philosophical types will spend hours talking about, saying nothing?”

Halea smirked, “No, most battlemages have a fairly good idea of just why the wraiths do it. Like Neferoy said, wraiths are fragmented souls. They seek out life so that they might consume it and draw the energy into themselves. They have an insatiable hunger-” she snorted, “**No,** not like that Thera,” Halea giggled, elbowing Thera in the ribs, “They’re trying to put themselves back together, but it can’t really be done, not permanently. I mean, the Ariros wraith killed dozens of its former guildmates, and that might have given it enough energy to return to sentience briefly, but it would only have been briefly.”

“After all,” I said, “If it had regained sentience for any length of time, then you’d think that it would have stopped killing its friends.”

“I would hope so,” Halea sighed.

“So.” Victorina stated, “An essentially indestructible wraith, that over the course of the past thousand years has killed more Mages than perhaps any other person, creature, or monster, in existence. And you really think that you can destroy it for good?”

“Hell no,” I said, “I barely know anything about magic, let alone combat magic, the thing would tear me in half.”

I got a round of blank looks from the others, and I elaborated, “I mean it’s clear that destroying it is not the solution. I don’t think it matters **how** it’s done, that much is clear. The wraith in and of itself isn’t the curse, the curse is the fact that the damned thing won’t stay dead. I’m going to lift the curse, and only the curse, and if all goes well then I won’t need to bother with the wraith at all.”

Victorina nodded, “That seems like sound reasoning, how are you going to do it then?”

“Fuck if I know,” I said, digging through my Portable Hole, “Anyone want some ice-cream?”

-----

Ice-cream was a big hit, especially the peanut butter ice-cream, and I was pleased with how well it turned out with so little time to prepare. Ice cream, as it happens, is pretty simple.

*Ice and cream, who knew? Well, also sugar. And peanut butter. Man, I should make some cinnamon ice cream…*

I turned in early that evening, and got up the following morning well before the sun had risen. I had big plans, and I couldn’t afford to waste time sleeping in like I normally did. I had to work with Neferoy to fabricate some proper glasses, I had to work with Minki to invent that new combat spell, *which hopefully won’t take a year*, and I needed to learn everything else there was to know about battlemagic from Halea. Victorina had mentioned, on the way back from Nezzabi’s castle, that she and Halea were roughly equally skilled when it came to casting the spells in question. According to Victorina though, Halea was an expert in the actual **use** of the spells, and she was the one that specialized in the use of magic for fighting.

I had still more goals, but those were less clear. Lifting the curse was an obvious one, but beyond basic self-defence magic to keep the wraith off of me, and learning that stasis spell so I’d be able to dispel it, I didn’t have a firm idea on how to tackle the problem. I didn’t even know where I’d learn the spell in the first place, so that went on my list of shit to do as well.

The more I got to know Neferoy, the more she seemed to resemble Minki. She was better in a crowd than Minki, but she also preferred to be left alone to tinker with her creations. I managed to crack her introvert’s shell though, by providing her with something entirely new to work on. I spent most of my mornings with her, working on various optical devices, and we got to know each other much better. Thankfully she knew Reshape, which meant that creating accurate lenses was much easier. I’d been worried that I’d need to figure out and then invent lens grinding, which could have taken months for all I knew, and probably would have left me with subpar lenses. With Reshape Neferoy had a lot more control over how the lens was shaped, and could correct her mistakes if she took too much away, not something that could be done with non-magical tools. It took a hell of a lot of trial and error, but we did eventually make me a set of glasses that worked. More or less. The trouble wasn’t Neferoy’s workmanship, it was the glass. I’d gotten the clearest and most perfect glass that I could find, but it just wasn’t quite good enough. The glasses did help with focus, and they helped a hell of a lot. Without glasses my vision is about 20/400, and with the new glasses I guessed that I was somewhere near 20/40. Still not great, but it was enough that I could actually walk around the University and get a good look at the place for the first time. The problem though was that the glass refracted each colour of light slightly differently. Neferoy and I even tested all the glass I’d bought, and more besides that we purchased afterwards, to see if we could find glass that didn’t have this issue. We did not have any luck.

In each case we’d make a pair of lenses, exactly of the sort that I’d wear, and then use them to try to focus the light cast by a Light spell. We used white light in every case, and in every case, the little dot of focused light wasn’t quite perfect. Instead of being a uniformly white spot, it looked like several spots of varying colours, overlaid upon one another. The centre of the spot was whiteish, but the edges were clearly of different colours.

“Ahrg, I just can’t get it quite right, I’m sorry Quinn. I know this is important to you,” Neferoy said apologetically.

I shook my head, “It’s not your fault Neferoy, it’s the glass. This is called ‘chromatic aberration’, and I’ve got no clue as to how to fix it. At least not without synthetic materials.”

“Is the… chromatic aberration, what’s causing the headaches?” She asked.

“More or less,” I acknowledged, “It’s not too bad, I can manage about an hour of wear before it’s too much. It’ll be enough for the arena at least, as long as things don’t go on too long.”

“Well let me know if you need help with anything else, I still feel bad about it Quinn.”

“It’s alright Neferoy, I’ll manage.”

-----

My afternoons were spent with Halea, who gave me a crash course in battle magic. She didn’t go into as much detail as Minki had when she was teaching me Apportation, and instead she focused on teaching me a wider variety of spells. The spell I was cooking up with Minki’s help would help a lot, and I hoped that it would shake up the competitive meta in the arena, but it wasn’t a golden gun. What Halea gave me was much needed background. Not only would I have some alternatives to draw upon if my creation didn’t work out, but I also gained an understanding of just what would be used against me. More importantly though, I also learned some defensive magic. Even if the spell I designed **was** a golden gun, it would rather disrupt my plans for victory if I got vaporized by a well-placed lightning bolt.

The two defensive spells I learned were called, rather boringly, Deflect Energy, and Deflect Physical. Deflect Energy would deflect energy projectiles, like lightning bolts or fire balls, and Deflect Physical would deflect things like stones, axes, and arrows.

“Halea, maybe it’s just me, but if both sides can get these blocking spells off fast enough, isn’t it just going to devolve into a competition to see who’s got more energy to throw around?” I asked, somewhat out of breath, as I picked myself up off the ground.

We’d gone into the area north of the city, where the former holdings of the Prefecture of Ariros were. The land here was entirely undeveloped, and all but empty of people. We didn’t go too far into the guild’s territory, ‘monsters’ were apparently a real risk if we ventured much further north, but it was far enough from the road that we’d not be spotted. Of course, Ken had protested immediately upon hearing of our plans. She wailed, *maybe wailed is unfair,* she feared that we’d be eaten by ghouls, kidnapped by brownies, or eaten by orcs. Halea replied by saying that she’d make a glowing crater out of the orc that tried it, and then Ken went off on a tangent about training accidents and said that we should be happy just to train in the arena like normal people. Fortunately Halea had appreciated proper op sec, and had promised not to hurt me “Too much.”

“In theory, sure,” she said, from her place at the other end of the small clearing, “But it’s finding ways to bypass or counter an opponent’s blocking spell, or finding ways to not need to cast one of your own, that sets one Mage apart from another though. Your trick to combine a blocking spell with a dodge is quite clever though. I’m surprised you can pull it off with so little practice.”

She was talking about the tactic I’d devised to make better use of my limited supply of enervation when it came time to avoid an attack. Calling it a ‘tactic’ or ‘strategy’ was probably overly generous though. I’d figured out early on that I could cast low powered version of either spell without using any enervation, much like I could with enervation. Equally quickly, I found that lower powered versions of the spells were rarely enough to stop what she was throwing at me. Catching the projectile early, just as she threw it, helped a lot. Both version of the spell diverted the attack to miss the caster, with more power causing a greater diversion. Catching it early meant that you needed less of a diversion, but that was hard to time properly. You could risk a lesser diversion at close range, but if the other caster put any real power into the spell then their spell would fight against your defensive magic and stay mostly on course to hit you.

Cast relatively late, a low powered Deflect Energy would knock her little stunner spell off target just enough to hit me in the shoulder, instead of the chest. I suppose that helped, I’d rather get shot in the arm than the heart after all, but better still was not getting shot at all.

What I’d been doing to avoid getting hit, was to cast my low powered Deflect spell, and at the same time throw myself to one side. Either one alone wasn’t enough. I’d still catch it in the shoulder with only the spell, and with only the dive to the side I’d still get hit. The spell she was using, and apparently nearly all such combat spells, had some level of guidance on them. Put together though, Deflect would disrupt the guidance, and the dodge would get me the rest of the way clear of the line of fire.

“Why not? I mean, it is slightly undignified,” I said, brushing off my jeans, “But it certainly works.”

“It does, the trouble is that most people can’t keep their concentration together on the spell and also move around at the same time,” she explained, casting an amused glance at the state of my clothing.

We’d been practicing a lot, and I was getting rather dusty.

“Just like I’ve got trouble walking and moving an Illusion at the same time?” I asked.

“Exactly, most people can’t even manage that much movement when focused on an Illusion, or any spell.” She explained, “Proper battlemages can do it, and I can do it, but not most Mages. You just seem to have picked it up rather quickly.”

I shrugged, and noticed for the first time just how sore I was, “Well I’ve been spending almost every waking moment with five simultaneous Apportation spells going at once, so maybe I haven’t picked it up quickly, since I’ve essentially been practicing constantly.”

“Hmm, true enough. As for the remark about it coming down to who has more energy, it seems like you’d be able to manage that just fine Quinn. Even if you haven’t got mana, you’ve got more than enough enervation to make up for it,” she observed.

“Yeah,” I said, pausing to take a breath, “It’s just a hell of a lot of work. You for example can hit zero on the mana reserve and still keep going. You can probably even still cast spells as long as you keep it to what you can cast for free. If I hit zero I pass out, and even getting close to half full makes me feel like it’s a good idea to fall over and go to sleep.”

“Aww,” she teased, “Does the big strong man need a rest?”

I snapped one hand towards her and muttered a word. Three little orbs of light, in a horizontal line, streaked from my hand and towards her position across the clearing.

She made a quick little gesture with one hand and a bluish plane of force appeared between us, which the projectiles then slammed against. I threw myself to the ground when I saw the shield go up, and cast Basic Illusion as quickly as I could. I got it off before her shield dropped, and the first thing she saw as the shield went down was a duplicate of myself running to one side. She bought it, and threw a pair of orbs at the duplicate, one after the other, in quick succession. The duplicate got ‘hit’ and stumbled, going down. It was at this point that I threw myself to my feet, throwing another trio of orbs at once as I rose.

As it turned out, she hadn’t bought it. She’d barely even turned to face me when one hand came up, and an orb of her own launched towards my position. I threw out a full powered Deflect Energy in response. She cast her shield spell at the same time, and I continued to close the distance between us as quickly as I could. Her orb was thrown off course, and my own slammed against her protective magic. I saw her casting another spell, and didn’t bother to wait. I started casting Deflect Energy immediately, and I finished just after she did.

There was no glowy orb of stunyness though, and instead I saw a blinding flash, and then blackness. I was still on my feet, running blindly towards her, at least until I was interrupted by a torrent of water that cut my feet right out from underneath me. It felt like someone had turned a fire hose on me, and I landed face first in the mud.

*Fuck you water.*

I tried to push myself back up with my useless hands, but slipped and fell back into the mud. It didn’t help that I was also completely blind as a result of the flash, and I shook my head to try to clear my vision.

“Oh Quinn, you’re a little messy,” Halea said, from somewhere fairly close, “Why don’t I give you a hand.”

There was another torrent of water, which this time blasted me in the face, and I was pushed several metres through the mud. It took me a moment to get my bearings, and I found myself floundering around on my back in the mud. I shook my head again, trying to get the mud out of my eyes. I started to get some vision back, though what I could see was obscured by white and black splotches.

I heard splashes approaching to one side as Halea approached, and then she spoke in an amused tone, “Mmm Quinn, you are a dir-ty dir-ty boy.”

*Alright, you want to play? Let’s play.*

I lifted a hand to point at her, as if I were about to loose another Stun Bolt, and I heard her speak the words to her shield spell. There followed a slight hiss, and the faint smell of ozone, as her shield snapped into place. I didn’t cast Stun Bolt though, I cast Apportation, and I put a hell of a lot of power behind it. I formed the spell into a long bar, and swept it along the ground at ankle height. I felt the same mental resistance as I always did when casting on another living thing, but I managed to keep the spell together as it connected with her legs. There was a wet thump, and a yelp, as she hit the ground, and I pounced on the noise.

Like all elves she was damn strong, and she took advantage of my exhaustion to try to get on top. We both rolled over multiple times as we struggled to stay on top of the other. I managed to win out, mainly by virtue of the fact that I still had my supercharged Apportation, and I flipped her over onto her stomach. Apportation came to an end about a second after that, and I sat myself down on her back to keep her in place.

“I’m really glad we did this out here,” I said, chest heaving, “And not in the arena.”

“Oh let me up you big oaf,” Halea sputtered, as she tried to push herself up.

“Hey, you started this,” I said, and I used another casing of Apportation to scoop some mud into her face. A great deal of it ended up going down her shirt, *whoopsie.*

“Bastard,” she laughed, before finally heaving me off of her back.

We both stood up, and turned to look at each other. I don’t know about myself, but she was a damn mess. Her normally fair skin was plastered with mud, and her hair was a tangled mess. I worried, a little guiltily, that I might have ruined her robes, since they were in almost as bad a state as the rest of her.

She covered her mouth with one hand, and choked out a laugh, “You’re a mess.”

I raised an eyebrow, “What the hell are we going to tell Victorina?”

Halea’s eyes got really wide, and she stepped forwards and put one finger to my lips, “No, no no no, we’re **not** going to tell Victorina.”

“Hey, works for me,” I agreed gladly, “Different question then. How the hell are we going to get back to the clubhouse without anyone seeing us?”

She combed out the tangles in her hair with one had, “I’ve got a cleaning spell, we’ll be fine.”

“Alright, just be careful. Last time you cast a spell on me you ended up face down in the mud.”

She lunged forwards, trying to hit me in the chest and push me over, but I was ready. Or at least, I thought I was. I jerked to one side, and she was unable to keep her balance. Unfortunately, neither was I, and we both ended up back in the mud.

-----

We managed to get ourselves cleaned up and on our way back to the clubhouse a short time later, though we both fell down giggling a few more times before we got on our way.

“Hold on,” I said, as we left the forest and came out onto the road, “Let’s go this way.”

“Past the guildhall?” She asked, eyebrows raised, “Is that a good idea?”

“Nope,” I said cheerily, “But I want to see it.”

“Alright,” she allowed, “But let’s not linger, it’s starting to get dark. And we need a signal.”

“A signal?” I asked sceptically.

“Heroes in stories always have signals, or signs, or secret codes. We need a signal in case things go bad and we need to run,” she said.

“Really?” I asked, “You’re not really the person I’d pick to get most of their knowledge out of adventure stores.”

“Well why do you think first piqued my interest in battle magic?”

“Fine,” I said, “I’ve got a signal. If things go tits up, I’ll start screaming incoherently. That’ll be the cue for us to run away.”

She looked at me with a smirk, “Do you normally run away screaming when you see some…” and she wiggled her chest at me.

I rolled my eyes, though I did feel myself turn slightly pink, “You’ve been talking to Thera too much. Or not enough, not sure which.”

“Hmmm, well I’ve got plenty to tell her about,” she teased.

“I’m just surprised that the two of you aren’t related.”

-----

“Damn,” I breathed, a short time later, “Are the other guild halls like this?”

“Of course, what exactly were you expecting Quinn?” Halea asked.

‘Guild hall’ did not do it justice. I expected some fancy old brick building, or something like one of those really fancy A-frame chalets I’d seen when I’d been to Banff in British Colombia. This was not what I saw. I saw a damned castle. I took my glasses from one of my belt pouches, and put them on so I could get a better look.

The structure was enormous. A massive curtain wall ringed the base of the hill, and it must have been twenty metres tall. The castle itself was even taller, and I counted five stories just in the central keep. The keep was hexagonal, and a massive stone tower dominated each of the corners of the keep. Each one was fully twice as tall as the keep proper, and each one looked like it was about as thick around as the entire clubhouse was. The eight of us could live in just the bottom half of one of those six towers, and we’d still have more space than we’d ever get at the clubhouse.

*I can see why Diova rents out the building to us, and stays in the League of Patricians’ guild hall. Oh yes, Quinn likey.*

“I was expecting something like the clubhouse, except bigger,” I said distractedly.

“Well,” Halea smirked, “This is bigger.”

*Oh yes. This will do nicely.*

# Chapter 35

Quinn

-----

I skipped my normal meetings with Neferoy and Halea the following day. They were both willing to work hard to help me out, but I got the impression that I’d started to push the boundaries of what they considered reasonable. It’s not that they’d been rude or even that they’d blown me off, but I had been taking a great deal of time over the past month, and it was only reasonable that they’d started to get a little weary of me. I’d been pushing myself rather hard over the past several weeks, only taking breaks on Feastdays, and working the other six days of the week. Of course, that also meant I wasn’t giving the others much of a break either.

As for Minki? Well that was a different story. I’d already been working with Minki for a couple of weeks before I ever started with the other two, but she had actually rejected my offer to finish the spell creation and testing on my own.

Her response had been, “I don’t mind the work Quinn, besides, this is the sort of thing I like to do anyways.”

In any case, it meant that most of the following day was spent testing the MAC spell with Minki’s help. The original plan had been to test the spells in the basement of the clubhouse, but I’d rejected that plan once I’d done the math on just how powerful this spell was going to be. It was comparable to a rifle in power, even with just one mana put towards the spell, and it would only go up from there. If we tested in the basement then a bullet might ricochet off of the stone of the foundations and bounce back at us, or a round could go through the floor and hurt someone above, all together it just wasn’t a great idea to test fire what was basically a gun inside the clubhouse. Ken insisted that this time the two of us really did need to go to the arena to test, but I really didn’t want to let anyone else know what we were preparing for the coming tournament. At first Minki was on board with Ken’s ‘suggestion’, until Halea said that this would be a perfect chance for Minki and I to go hiking, and the emphasis she put on the work ‘hiking’ seemed to be enough to get Minki on board with the plan to test the spell in the forest.

------

I wasn’t sure how far the projectiles would fly, so we hiked further into the former Prefecture lands until we found a suitable firing range. We settled on a large berm. The way it was oriented meant that we could fire towards it, while facing away from the city proper. Unfortunately there was nothing like ballistic gelatine or ballistic soap to test on, so I had to satisfy myself by testing against the various armour making materials that Minki had purchased for our testing. She also had a spell that worked like a chronograph, so we’d also be able to double check my math.

“What are we starting with Quinn?” Minki asked, as I was digging through my Portable Hole.

“The hardened leather. I know we’re going to punch right through it, really I just want something to aim at while we double check the velocity figures,” I explained, as I pulled out a folding table.

There were a few trees between us and the berm, and Minki tacked a square of leather to a fairly thick specimen. I set up the folding table while she was busy with the targets, and also pulled out a pair of chairs for the two of us.

“I also want to make sure that there’s not going to be any accuracy issues, so this’ll give us a better idea of just where our shots are landing,” I finished.

Minki nodded, “Start at one mana and work our way up?”

“Yeah,” I confirmed as she walked back towards the table.

I’d set up the folding table about ten metres from the tree. I did want to test for range later, but ten metres would do for now. The arena was large, but according to what I’d read on the subject and heard from the others, fights often ended up happening somewhere around the ten metre range.

“You ready with that spell?” I asked, as I prepared to cast MAC, which really needed a better name.

“Ready,” she confirmed, and I cast the spell.

There was no bang of exploding gunpowder, but there was a snap as the projectile broke the sound barrier, and then a puff of splinters from just above where Minki had set the leather target.

Minki looked up at me out of the corner of her eye.

“This is harder than it looks,” I said defensively, “Now what was the speed?”

“Five hundred and forty eight metres per second,” She replied.

“Perfec- Hold on, metres per second?” I asked.

“I tweaked the spell a little, now it tells me the speed in metres per second instead of miles an hour,” she explained, “You were the one that told me that metres were ‘more scientific’ after all. Is that okay? Did you want it in miles?”

“No, it’s perfect Minki. And it certainly makes the math easier,” I replied, “We were expecting numbers somewhere in the five-fifty range, so it sounds like the spell works as we had intended.”

A 10 gram projectile moving at 550 metres per second gave a total kinetic energy of 1512.50 joules. This was only two or three hundred joules less than a 5.56mm rifle cartridge, the 5.56mm being the standard cartridge for the AR-15 and M-16 weapon platform. The speed was lower than the actual rifle cartridge, but on the other hand the projectile was a little more than twice as heavy. The lower speed and fatter projectile did reduce armour penetration to some extent, but then I wasn’t going to face opponents with modern plate carriers and level IV body armour. No, the most I had to contend with was bronze or iron plate, and poor quality iron and bronze at that. The fatter projectile then was an advantage, since while slower and larger projectiles aren’t great against armour, they **are** great at tearing holes in soft and fleshy things.

“Try again with two mana then?” Minki asked.

I shook my head, “Nah, not just yet, I want to try the spell with one mana a couple more times. I want to make sure the miss was due to me being unfamiliar with the spell, and not some mistake in how we designed it. Besides, you ought to get a chance to try it too.”

The two of us spent a good hour or so getting used to how the spell worked, and we found that it was actually fairly accurate once we managed to get a feel for the spell. We were using round projectiles which probably didn’t help matters much, but the spell had been designed to put a spin on the projectile, so it wasn’t too terrible. Even on snap shots, with very little time to aim, we were both hitting the target more than nine times out of ten. It was a very natural feeling, using the spell, and when we did aim we could even put multiple shots through the same hole. Granted, we were only at ten metres, but I had some ideas to increase the effective range of the spell.

“I’ll need to have some purpose built projectiles made before the tournament. I bet that with the right ammo we’d be accurate up to five hundred metres or so,” I said, as I sat back in one of the chairs.

“Isn’t that what these are?” Minki asked, nodding towards a small pouch that held more of the little lead balls.

“I suppose, but we can do better than that,” I replied, as I pulled some paper and something to draw with from my belt.

I sketched out a rough approximation of what a modern rifle bullet looked like. It was three or four times longer than it was wide, and was tapered to a point at the front, with a boat tail at the back.

“I mean, even rocks work to some extent, and they’re good enough for close range work, but this is much better. This will push the effective range out much further than the simple lead balls we’ve been using,” I explained.

Minki nodded, “I can see how this would fly through the air better,” she said, “It does mean that you’ve got to carry your projectiles around with you though.”

“Yeah,” I acknowledged, “That is one advantage of something like Fireball or Lighting Bolt, they don’t require anything other than mana. Though, you could still use rocks or other bits of debris with this spell, if you really needed to.”

“It certainly seems worth the extra step,” she allowed, “I don’t know any combat spell that would be as effective as this. Maybe Halea has a better idea, but whoever you cast this at would need to already have gotten most of the way through casting Deflect for them to have any hope of avoiding the spell, and this is all with just one mana.”

“Want to test with two?” I asked, and Minki nodded vigorously, which set her mess of grey hair to flying around.

She rushed off to prepare three more targets. The first two were iron and bronze plates, and according to Minki, they were both about as thick as the average breastplate. The last target was silk, though it bore the same sort of armouring enchantment that I’d paid to have placed on my robes.

“How much energy do we expect this one to have?” Minki asked as she sat back down to prepare her chronograph spell.

“Double the first one, so about three thousand joules,” I explained, *which makes the two mana version at a little less powerful than a 7.62x51mm cartridge,* “Ready?”

“Ready,” she confirmed, and I cast the spell, this time at the sheet of iron.

There was another snap as the projectile exceeded the speed of sound, and at essentially the same time, the sheet of iron shattered. I flinched away from the flying fragments, and turned towards Minki, ducking down to cover her with my body. I felt a few bits of iron thump against the cloth of my robes, but the enchantment was enough to keep them from penetrating.

“I am really incredibly sorry Minki,” I said, absolutely horrified and incredibly ashamed at how stupid I’d been, “I really should have seen that coming, are you alright?”

“I’m okay,” she said, her voice muffled by my robes.

I’d fallen into a crouch, half-curled around her, when the fragments had started flying, and had pulled her in close towards me. Her head was tucked just under my chin, and she had her arms pulled in tight around herself.

“Sorry,” I said, stepping back and standing up, “I’m really, really sorry. That was stupid of me, I should have expected something like that to happen.”

She looked uninjured, though a little shaken, which made me feel much better. I wouldn’t have been able to forgive myself if I’d hurt her out of sheer stupidity.

She reached out just a little as I pulled away, before turning pink and snatching back the hand, “It’s okay, I’m okay. Are you okay?”

“Yeah, Minki… I am so sorry,” I repeated, still absolutely abashed.

“It’s okay Quinn really,” she reassured me, then she allowed herself a small smile, “Normally I’m the one apologizing profusely. It’s kind of swee-“ she stopped suddenly, eyes widening, “Quinn!” she exclaimed.

“What?” I asked, as she bent down, peering at my leg, “Oh, damn…”

It wasn’t until I noticed the trickly blood that I felt the pain. There was a small hole in the back of my jeans where they covered my calf, and the area around the hole was red with blood.

*Maybe I should have paid attention when Amezzer said that my jeans couldn’t hold a very sturdy enchantment.*

“Um, um, um, do you know any healing magic?” Minki asked, clearly freaked out, but making an effort to keep it together.

“No,” I replied, “One of my belt pouches is full of medical supplies though.”

Minki swallowed, and then nodded, “Okay, sit down,” she said, pointing towards one of the chairs that still sat next to the folding table.

I took a seat, and pulled out one of the healing kits that I kept in my belt. Minki took it from me and knelt down to see to the wound. I tried to pull up the leg of my jeans so that she’d have clearer access to the wound site, but my legs were beefy enough that I couldn’t pull the hem of my jeans up over my calf.

“Fine,” Minki said, once we’d struggled with it enough, “Take off your pants.”

“Pardon me?” I asked, as she blushed.

“Take off your pants!” She commanded, now bright red.

“If you insist,” I said, undoing my belt and shimmying out of my jeans.

“Um, are you ready?” Minki asked.

“Ready for wh-Ahh!” I yelped, as Minki pulled something out of the wound.

She dropped the bit of metal onto the ground beside my foot, and the damned thing was an inch long. I was suddenly very glad that it hadn’t gone into the back of my thigh. The blood started flowing much more freely once the shard was removed, but Minki was ready for that. She slapped a gauzy pad over the wound, and let the salve that was soaked through the material set to work on my leg. I let out a breath, and leaned back in the chair.

“Oh,” said a new voice, from off to one side, “Am I interrupting something?”

I looked to one side, so see Halea standing there with an amused expression, and then I looked down at Minki. Who was kneeling between my legs. And I had my pants off. Now it was my turn to blush, and Minki on the other hand skipped right past red, and somehow managed to achieve a shade of purple.

“This is not what it looks like,” I said hurriedly.

“Well what does it look like?” Halea asked, as she joined us at the table, “Because I can’t make sense of it.”

I grumbled, and waved one hand, “I did a stupid thing, but managed to hurt only myself by doing the stupid thing. Minki’s just tending to the resulting wound.”

“Mmm, oh, that does look nasty,” she said, peering over Minki’s shoulder, “Is that what you pulled out of his leg?” she asked, nudging the fragment of iron with a toe.

“Yes,” Minki replied quietly, she’d hunched her shoulders and bowed her head in an effort to hide her embarrassment.

“Are you going to be okay?” Halea asked, concern breaking through her generally amused air.

“Yeah, I’ll be fine,” I said tiredly, “I had the healing kit to hand already, I’ll live.”

------

Minki had me patched up in short order, and I put my jeans back on. Halea had patched up and cleaned the leg of my jeans, and despite her protests, I put them back on.

Then I did some math, and I realized that I’d made an error. Well, another error. The first one was firing at an iron target at close range. The second one was a mathematical error. I’d assumed that twice as much mana meant twice as much energy. This was not how the spell worked though, twice as much mana meant twice as much force. Twice as much force meant twice as much speed, and twice as much speed, meant **four** times as much energy.

I’d assumed that with two mana the spell would give me performance that worked out to a little less than a 7.62x51mm rifle cartridge. When most people think of a ‘sniper rifle’, this is what that rifle fires. But I didn’t get three thousand joules of energy in exchange for two mana, I got six thousand joules of energy. This meant that the result was comparable to a .338 Lapua Magnum round, and if you’re not familiar with guns, a .338 is a very powerful cartridge. Elephant guns and big bore rifles aside, in military applications if you want a more powerful cartridge, your only real choice is the .50 BMG. Granted, if I’d been right about the math, firing a 7.62mm cartridge at a relatively thin iron plate still wouldn’t have been a very smart idea, but it wouldn’t have thrown fragments as far as the .338 equivalent did.

“So you’re saying that you get four times as much destructive power with only a doubling of the energy you put in?” Halea asked, once I’d explained the mishap to the two of them.

I nodded, “Yes, well, more or less. I don’t know that the two mana version is four times as killy as the one mana version, but yes, it has four times the energy.”

“What if your opponent is very close though?” She asked, “How quickly is all of the energy applied?”

“It’s all done in less than a thousandth of a second,” I explained, “I’m pretty sure I could put more force behind the projectile if I applied it over a larger span of time, but then you would start running into problems at short range.”

“Can you launch more than one of these lead balls with a single casting?” Halea asked, clearly interested in what Minki and I had created.

“As is, no. The spell’s only set up for individual projectiles, I think that’s something we’ll need to add though,” I said, glancing over to Minki, who nodded in agreement.

“Do the projectiles track the target?” Came her next question.

I shook my head, “No, and I don’t know that adding tracking would help. The projectiles travel so fast that any correction in flight would take an incredible amount of energy. The homing on Fireball works because most of the energy that gets put into a Fireball goes into the fire itself, relatively little goes into making the projectile move, so it’s easy to make corrections afterwards. With this, **all** the energy goes into making the projectile move.”

She nodded, “That makes sense. So would this be a bolt-type spell then, or a ball-type spell?”

“What?” I said, confused. *Bolt-type? Ball type?*

“Oh right,” she said, “We haven’t really covered that now have we. A bolt spell fires the projectile, whatever it might be, immediately upon casting the spell. A ball type spell prepares the projectile when you cast it, allowing you more control over just when you launch it. It does mean that ball spells aren’t quite as quick to use, but the greater control can count for a lot when you’re trying to avoid an enemy blocking spell.”

I frowned in though, “Well, as is, it’s a bolt spell. I think we’re going to need to create a ball version, if that terminology really applies in this case. Does that mean you could have a Fire Bolt, and a Lightning Ball spell?” I asked.

“Sure,” she confirmed, “I just haven’t had time to teach you either of those versions, but they certainly exist.”

“This certainly gives me some ideas,” I said, considering the possibilities, “What about jets then? Are they just another ‘type’ of spell like bolt and ball are? Could you make an acid or water bolt, just like you’ve got the acid and water jet?”

“Mmm hmm, those both exist, they’re just not terribly useful,” she explained, “Water bolt, and water ball, are obviously pretty useless, at least for real combat. I mean, it might disorient your target, but then so would a Fireball in the face. Acid Bolt and Acid Ball are used normally in combat, but they fall into the same trap as other bolt and ball spells.”

“You can deflect them,” I stated.

“Yes. It is very unpleasant to get hit with any acid spell, but it’s not until your opponent gets close and casts acid as a jet that you’ve really got to worry,” Halea explained.

“I wonder if we could make our spell into a jet,” Minki wondered, “I don’t know how that would really work though.”

“Maybe a jet of sand?” I considered, “Make the projectiles any larger and they're either going to be too slow, or it’s going to take a tremendous amount of mana.”

“Sand Jet exists already, in a couple different styles,” Halea provided, “It doesn’t see a whole lot of use in the arena though, except by those with an aversion to using Acid Jet.”

“I’m guessing it’s used as an alternative to blind your opponent?” I guessed, and Halea nodded in reply, “What about the different styles? What did you mean by that?”

“Well there’s not just one single type of Sand Jet, or of any other sort of spell. The University has their own preferred version of each they’ll teach to students, but there are plenty of variations on each. I know eleven different versions of Fireball for example. Some are more specialized in one area or another, and some have been tweaked to fit a particular Mage’s personal preference. There are nearly as many variations on Fireball as there are Mages who know it, well, as long as you don’t count those less talented.”

“Right, because every Mage with enough talent will probably knock together some variant Fireball in the hopes that it’s what’s going to lead them to victory in the arena,” I realized.

“Exactly, it takes a week, at most, to put together a custom spell, so everyone does it. Many variant spells never exist outside of the head of the one that created it, but a few get written down.”

“And when you’re talented enough, and already know the base spell, it’s no trouble to skim the book or pamphlet or whatever, and learn the variant,” *hmm, this gives me a terrible idea,* “So would it be possible then, to create a more powerful version of Acid Jet, just by switching to a stronger acid?”

*I mean, the mass of the created fluid would remain the same, so the upper limit on destructive power would be entirely based on how much the creator knows about chemistry.*

Minki spoke, for the first time in a while, “Yes, Andrew did exactly that when he arrived here. He hasn’t shared his spell with anyone, not even any of his clubmates, but his versions of the acid spells are much stronger than the spell the University teaches.”

*I’d need to check out the base version of the spell, but I bet he replaced the existing acid with hydrochloric acid. He would have known about it from high school chemistry, and it’s not like it’s terribly complicated.*

“Well,” I smiled, “I think I’ve got a couple ways to one-up Andrew there. I’ll need to learn Acid Jet first, but I’ve got a couple ideas that the club might find useful. Besides, I do like the idea of beating Andrew at his own game when it comes time to fight him in the arena.”

Halea grimaced, “About that Quinn…”

*Uh oh.*

“What is it?” I asked uneasily.

“I’m not saying you can’t fight in the arena, I don’t have the right to order you to do anything,” she said, nodding towards me, *to my robes actually,* “But you should really think about whether you want to do this or not. I know we’ve been practicing a lot, but there’s still a lot you don’t know, and there’s still a lot of theory that you need to learn. You’ve been here barely more than a month, Andrew’s been here most of a year now, and he’s gotten very good at battlemagic in that time. Your spell is quite clever, but I don’t know if that’s enough to make up the difference.”

“I’ll be careful Halea,” I reassured her, “And besides, I’m pretty familiar with the way that Andrew likes to fight,” *as long as videogames count as fighting.*

Halea didn’t seem convinced, but she also didn’t press the issue. We did a bit more testing, this time at a safer distance, and we discovered what I’d pretty much already guessed from my mathematical scribbling.

The spell was damned powerful.

At one mana the spell was strong enough to punch through any of the targets, and at two mana it would pass clean through both the target **and** the tree behind it. It didn’t take a whole lot more testing for Halea to be absolutely smitten with our creation, and Minki promised to teach it to her in time for the coming tournament.

We stayed out late, and it wasn’t until the sun started to dip towards the horizon that Halea suggested we start heading back.

“Ken expected me back hours ago,” she said through a yawn, “We should head back before she starts organizing a search party.”

“What do you mean Halea? Were you supposed to work on something with her?” Minki asked

Halea shook her head, “No, I came out here because she kept nagging me to check on you two. I didn’t just come out here to try to catch Quinn with his trousers down,” she smirked, “I was supposed to make sure that neither of you had injured yourselves.”

“Right, about that,” I said, “Let’s not tell her?”

“About you shooting yourself in the leg?” Halea laughed, “No, I think we can keep that to ourselves.”

“That was incidental fragmentation,” I said defensively, “It’s entirely different.”

“If you say so.”

-----

“Halea,” I asked, as we were walking back towards the city, “Wouldn’t it be possible to tweak a spell just enough to make counterspelling impossible? Or at least more difficult?”

“Impossible, no. It’s certainly possible to make it much more difficult though, which in practical terms just means that the counterspelling will take longer. That’s part of the reason Mages make custom combat spells, even if you only add a quarter second to the time it takes to counter your spell, that can make all the difference.” Halea explained.

“What about enchantments?” I asked.

“You’re thinking of the stasis enchantment? The case there is much the same, though the amount of time involved is different,” she said, “A modified spell can add, at most, a second to the time to counter it. In reality it’s going to be only a few tenths of a second. With an enchantment it’s on the order of minutes.”

I grimaced, “I really don’t want to be hanging around trying to dispel the enchantment while the wraith tries to kill me.”

Halea huffed out an amused breath, “That’s smart of you. I hope you don’t expect that dispelling the enchantment is going to be enough to lift the curse though,” she said.

“What do you mean?”

“Well it’s been tried Quinn, more than once. Most things have been tried, there’s been a thousand years of people trying. I’m just going to guess at your plan, and you can tell me if I’m close,” she said, in a reasonable tone, “You’re guessing that her soul is fragmented by the stasis enchantment, some is trapped within, some without. Dispelling the enchantment, you hope, should allow those bits of her soul to recombine. Maybe you’ve even recognized that repairing the fracture will take some degree of magical energy, and are planning to create some sort of oversized Manastone to provide the energy required to mend the break. From there, you’d return the now repaired soul to the body, returning the girl to life. Is that about what you were planning?”

*That actually was my plan. All of it.*

“I’m guessing that didn’t work?” I sighed.

“No. Dispelling the enchantment is the easy part, and from what Neferoy’s told me, even that usually results in at least one death among the party trying to lift the curse. It takes as many as ten minutes since no one knows the original spell, and in that time the rest of the group needs to hold off a maniacal spellcasting wraith. Getting together enough power to mend the fracture in the girl’s soul is nearly impossible, and while I know some attempts have even successfully put the soul back into the body, I have no idea how that would be done. I haven’t even heard of a spell that could do it, and even for the groups that did know such a spell, it didn’t work.”

“The stasis spell came back up before they could finish?” I asked.

“No,” Halea replied, “The soul was forced back out immediately. Her ‘body’ is a body, it’s dead. A soul can’t bind to a body unless it’s alive. For all I know, a soul can’t bind to **anything** once it’s been cut loose.”

“Well,” *shit,* “This might be slightly more difficult than I thought it would be.”

-----

I stayed up late that night, learning Acid Jet, Acid Ball, and Acid Bolt. The following day was Feastday, so I didn’t have anything pressing to get up for in the morning. It took all of that night, and the Feastday, but I figured out how to create some truly horrific variants of the acid spells. The version of the spell that was taught by the University and was available at the bookstore, used acetic acid. Acetic acid is not very strong, at least as acids go. Hell, most people have diluted acetic acid in their house, it’s called vinegar. It’s still spectacularly unpleasant to get on your skin, and it will cause rather unpleasant chemical burns, but it’s small potatoes compared to what Earth science had created in the past few hundred years. I still didn’t know for certain, but if Andrew’s version used hydrochloric acid then that would certainly explain the significant increase in performance that Andrew’s version of the spell seemed to have. I could do more though. I knew what fluoroantimonic acid was, *say that five times fast.* Fluoroantimonic acid, assuming I could stuff it into a spell, was a million billion trillion times stronger than Andrew’s hydrochloric acid. And no, that’s not hyperbole. Hydrochloric acid burns flesh, this stuff **eats** bone. This wasn’t going to cause some chemical burns, it was going to melt limbs clean off.

*Well, maybe not ‘clean’.*

But wait! There’s more. What’s better than beating Andrew at the acid game, by creating a better acid? Creating a better anti-acid, also known as a base. Bleach and drain cleaner are both bases for example, though I was going to pick something quite a bit stronger. Sodium hydride was my base of choice, and while it wasn’t nearly as powerful as fluoroantimonic acid, it was much simpler. Sodium hydride was just sodium and hydrogen, while fluoroantimoic acid was actually a combination of two different, more complicated, acids. If I did meet difficulties creating the acid, the base at least should be doable. This was **definitely** something to test in the arena though. Getting a drop of this stuff on me would be bad enough, but worse still would be the fumes.  

*Don’t breathe this.*

It was quickly starting to look like my main difficulty wasn’t going to be killing my opponent, it was going to be not killing myself.

For my next trick, chlorine trifluoride!

*I am so getting expelled.*

# Chapter 36

Victorina

-----

Quinn was where Minki had said he would be, sprawled face down on one of the couches in the library, out cold. His legs stuck out over the end of the couch, which was quite a lot smaller than Quinn himself, and one of his arms dangled down to the carpeted floor of the library. He looked absolutely exhausted.

*Well he certainly took it to heart when I told him that I wanted club members willing to put in the effort.*

I bent down next to him, and shook his shoulder gently, “Quinn,” I said softly, trying not to startle him.

He stirred a little, and then groaned, “Mmm, Minki?”

“No,” I said, keeping to a gentle tone, “Victorina. You’re not working with Minki tonight, come on, let’s get you to bed.”

Quinn managed to haul himself into a sitting position, and rubbed at his sleepy eyes, “Actually we were going to tweak the MAC spell a little. Halea suggested some modif-“

“Quinn,” I said forcefully, “Look at yourself. You’re a mess!”

This jogged Quinn awake, and his eyes were suddenly clear of the earlier sleepiness, and he looked somewhat displeased, “Hey, I was just taking a nap. Besides, I’m clean and stuff.”

I sighed, “That’s not what I mean Quinn, I’m talking about the unnecessary hardship you’re putting yourself through. I understood your fervour at first, when you were trying to get a better handle on Apportation. Or at least, I thought I did. I thought you were pushing yourself that hard so you’d be able to take care of yourself better, since you need Apportation to replace your hands. But then you didn’t stop, if anything you’ve been working harder now than you were before. How much sleep have you even been getting Quinn?”

Quinn sighed, “About five hours a night.”

“It’s not healthy Quinn,” I chastised.

“You were the one that told me how important it was that everyone in the club work so hard, and I’ve got the tournament to prep for,” he replied.

“Running yourself into the ground is not the way to prepare for the tournament, and even if it was, you shouldn’t be competing regardless,” I told him sternly.

Quinn was a little taken aback at this, and I continued, “Do you really think your tricky new telekinesis spell is going to be enough to propel you to victory?”

“Well,” Quinn hesitated, “Yes. I know there’s more to it than having the most powerful offensive spell, but Halea’s been helping me with defensive spells and some other combat stuff.”

“Combat stuff.” I repeated, “Combat stuff? I talked to Halea, Quinn. She doesn’t think it’s a good idea for you to go charging off into the arena either. You’re still missing a lot of background when it comes to battle magic, and the opening tournament is meant for the best students of combat magic that the university has to offer. Now,” I said sternly, as he was about to speak, “I know what you’re going to say, that you’ll need some practical experience at some point, but this is not the way you get it. Halea told me about what the spell can do, and it’s very impressive, but it’s not enough. You’ll probably win the first match, off of surprise alone, but I can almost guarantee that you’d lose the second. And then all anyone will remember about your big debut in the arena is that you won the first match with a gimmick, and lost the second because you had nothing else, and your opponent was ready.”

Quinn opened his mouth to speak, and then stopped himself.

“You want to beat Andrew, don’t you,” I said knowingly.

“I want to kick his fucking teeth in,” Quinn said, with cold fury, “For a multitude of reasons.”

I raised my eyebrows, Quinn was usually fairly cool headed, and I didn’t think I’d ever seen this side of him before, “Well. Take a step back from your self-righteous fury, and consider what you might say if someone else asked you for advice in this situation. Would you suggest that they try to learn in a month, what took their more talented adversary most a year to learn,” I said reasonably, though Quinn’s jaw tightened at the comment about Andrew being more talented, “Or would you suggest that they prepare properly, practice against people of their own skill level, and bide their time until they’re ready?”

Quinn grimaced, and leaned back into the couch, “Yeah, I get it,” he grumbled.

“Good,” I said cheerily, “Which means you can relax, and stop working yourself to death.”

“Hey, I’m not ‘working myself to death’,” he said, in a high pitched voice that I was sure was supposed to mimic mine.

“Quinn, did you know that you’re the first person to ever pass through this club that I’ve had to talk to about working **less?**”

“Well how hard do the others work? How hard do Mages outside of this club work?” He asked.

“Between proper courses and self-study, I’d guess around six hours a day for most of us in the club, though most of us don’t work quite so hard when we’re on a break like this. For most Mages though, it can be four hours, or even less. You on the other hand,” I said, more than a little exasperated, “Are getting six hours a day out of three different people, every day.”

Quinn raised his hands, and bowed his head, “Alright, alright.”

“I’m not upset with you Quinn,” I said gently, “I just worry about my club members, and I want to make sure that you’re taking care of yourself. Relax a little, pick one hugely difficult task to do at a time, and not three. You’ve gotten a little caught up in preparing for the fight with Andrew, that you’ve neglected things like your hands. I remember what you told me about ‘nerves’ and such, maybe do some work on healing magic. Or lightning magic, Minki told me about how you wanted to use lighting to do something with that little rectangle of glass you showed her. Save combat magic for later. Halea’s probably taught you enough by now that you’d be able to enrol in an intermediate battle magic course this semester, which will also give you a chance to practice in the arena.”

“You’re right, of course,” Quinn grumbled, then perked up, “Healing and lightning magic… Healing. And Lightning.“

“Quinn?” I prompted.

“Sorry,” he said, shaking himself, “Just a thought. Aside from enrolling in courses, is there anything else I should be ready for, come the start of the semester?”

“Well, since you’re not going to be fighting in the tournament,” I said, and Quinn rolled his eyes, “Just the ball, you’ll want to find a partner.”

“Oh,” he said, “Well, how long do I have?”

“The ball is next Feastday, no, not the coming one,” I said hurriedly, in response to his look of terror, “The one after, but that’s something for tomorrow. For now, get yourself to bed before you fall over.”

-----

“Like, at least you don’t need to worry about trying to find a date for the dance,” Brandy said.

“Maybe, but at least you’re not going to be forced to spend an evening getting manhandled by some jumped up lordling,” Halea responded.

She was right of course, her parents, along with Ken and Minki’s parents, were likely to use the dance to introduce the girls and their future husbands as a couple to the rest of the assembled nobles. The ball, along with the tournament, always drew in royal, noble, and merchant families from all over the continent, and it was often a venue for such politicking.

“Just go with Quinn,” Ken said, “You’re both human, and he won’t look like a freak standing next to you.”

“Ken!” Brandy chastised, “Like, oh my god, don’t be so mean.”

“Sorry,” Ken muttered, “But just imagine him trying to dance with Minki.”

“Quinn’s probably not going to dance with anyone if he can help it,” Thera chipped in.

She’d joined the rest of us, Quinn excluded, in the sitting room for our all-important girl talk.

“What do you mean by that?” I asked.

“Well if I understood what Sila told me-“ Thera started.

“That’s the little peasant girl?” Halea asked.

Thera nodded, “Well if what she told me is true, then Quinn does not enjoy dancing, not one bit. He was in that little village for months, and according to her something always seemed to come up whenever their village would host the Feastday. She seemed naïve enough to believe Quinn’s excuses on their face, but I got the impression that Quinn was doing everything he could to avoid it.”

“Maybe he just didn’t want to dance with what’s-her-name,” I suggested.

Thera shrugged, “Maybe, but I don’t know. Quinn can be a lot of fun when there aren’t too many people around,” she said, and I rolled my eyes, “Not just that kind of fun Vicky,” she teased, “But you’ve seen how he is around larger groups. It probably just makes him nervous, maybe he should go with Minki, they can find a corner to hide in together.”

“Quinn’ll probably get a pass,” I said, “I do want him to be present, but no one will expect more than that, not with his injuries. You though,” I turned to Minki, who was huddled in a chair, “Will likely be expected to dance with whoever your parents have set you up with.”

“Do I have to?” she asked quietly.

I sighed, “No, but it would help a lot Minki. If you can make nice, well, it’s going to buy us some more time.”

Minki nodded reluctantly, “I understand.”

“Why don’t you go with Quinn, Vicky?” Neferoy asked, “Going with an Outsider is prestigious enough, and it’ll make it easier to move about if you’re not being pulled away to dance, whether that’s with Quinn or with other nobles.”

“You think he’ll scare the other boys away?” Brandy giggled.

“Quinn can be pretty scary if you don’t know him very well,” Minki said.

I frowned in thought, “Do you think Quinn will go for that?”

“Lead with the fact that he won’t need to dance, and he’ll fall at your feet,” Thera smirked.

“Where is he anyways?” Halea asked.

“He went to the Library,” Minki provided, “He said he wanted to see if he could find any more detailed medical texts.”

“Like, more complicated healing spells?” Brandy asked.

Minki shook her head, “No, he said it was specifically non-magical stuff that he was looking for.”

“I hope he finds what he’s looking for,” I said, “I can only imagine how frustrated I would be if I had only Apportation manipulators to interact with the world through, and nothing else.”


# Chapter 37

Quinn

-----

*Damn. This place is huge.*

I’d walked past the building multiple times, though never while wearing my new glasses, and I hadn’t really noticed it then. Looking at it now though, I saw that there was a great deal to appreciate. Lili had mentioned, when she was first showing me around, that very early in the University’s history, the Library **was** the University. This was evident just by looking at the place. When I’d first heard of the University I’d imagined a building that looked like the , which had always looked to me like it was the headquarters of a wizarding school. I’d been strangely disappointed to find that the University had much more in common with the campus of the University of Toronto, with the only major difference being the medieval architecture. Well the Library did look like a proper wizarding school.

As the University had grown, with new buildings springing up around the castle like structure, students and teachers had moved out into the more spacious and newly constructed residences and classrooms. At the same time, the Library’s collection grew, so as the students and teachers moved out, the now empty space was taken up by the expanding collection. It left the University with a library that was comparable to the British Library or the Archives of Canada, which in simple terms meant that the place was massive.

*I really hope they have a decent filing system.*

-----

*Oh god dammit.*

On the one hand, they had a spectacular filing system, on the other, it was only in place in a little less than half of the Library’s total volume. I wasn’t sure how that translated into raw numbers of books, but the older areas, which were largely unfiled, were much more densely packed than the newer ones. Granted, ‘new’ was a relative term, and referred to any part of the collection that had been assembled or sorted in the past four hundred years.

About four hundred years ago a rather enterprising club had devised a rather clever enchantment for the indexing of books. Aside from just god damned sorting them properly, instead of piling books everywhere, they also placed what was essentially an enchanted stamp on the inside cover of each book. The stamp enchantment was relatively cheap, and it got cast on a hell of a lot of books. There were limits, it was cheap, not free, which probably explained why less than half the collection had been indexed so far. It did a great deal to organize things though, and along with an equally simple companion enchantment, it was incredibly easy to find books in the indexed areas. Wizards and less talented Mages get handed what’s basically a magical bookmark, and more talented Mages learn a simple spell. Either can lead the enterprising scholar to the book they want, with very little effort.

Want to find something in the rest of the collection? Well good luck. The University’s librarians are working on it, but then, they’ve been working on it for four hundred years so far, and it was probably going to take at least four hundred more.

*I need to start drawing a map. Actually, I need to get my phone working. I can’t leave with any of those books, but I’ve got that scanner app on my phone. Hell, I’ve got a 256GB microSD card in my phone, and another 64GB just from internal storage. If the scanner app can OCR the handwritten characters, I can store a hell of a lot of compressed text on my phone. I need to get my phone working. And also enchant it to be indestructible.*

I left the Library just long enough to get a bite to eat, and sat down at a café nearby to think. I’d spent most of the morning looking through the indexed sections in search of what passed for anatomical texts in this society. Unfortunately, probably due to the presence of healing magic, there was very little to be found. I hadn’t found out for sure, but I guessed that dissections of elf cadavers were likely illegal, or at least not practiced. I needed a text by an elven Leonardo Da Vinci, but was out of luck.

There was a very basic X-Ray like spell, but then it was just an X-Ray spell. According to the description it would give the caster a good look at any bone damage, but made no mention of nerves, blood vessels, arteries, or any number of other things. I could invent an MRI spell, but that was going to take much more time. I’d spent the past few days after Victorina’s talking to working only on the MAC spell, and my plans for a Super Acid Jet spell. Work on the MAC spell went well, Super Acid Jet, not so much. I’d figured that if I wasn’t going to kick Andrew’s ass, Halea might as well be the one to do it. So Minki and I taught her MAC, and I poked around a little with Acid Jet, to see how hard it was to change the substance it created.

Halea learned the MAC spell just fine, and we fixed most of the bugs that had come up in testing. Changing the substance of the Acid Jet was much harder though. In theory, it was 4 days to invent a new spell, and this was true. In practice though, it was much harder if you didn’t have good reference spells to hand. MAC was easy because it was a very basic modification of the Poltergeist spell, we just optimized it for smaller and faster projectiles. A new substance needed to be defined magically though, which was somewhat more difficult. It was possible, but it could take a few weeks, and would take longer with more complicated substances. Once it was defined though, it could be dropped into any spell. So once Super Acid Jet was built, Super Acid Ball, and Super Acid Bolt were possible in short order.

I did slap together a simple nozzle spell though. This was something I could do naturally with Apportation, but then not everyone was as flexible as I was when it came to constructing manipulators. Instead Halea and I tested a few different nozzles, and then I codified it as a variant Apportation. Ideally we would have modified Acid Jet itself, but that would have taken a little longer, and would only fix Acid Jet, and not any of her other Jet spells. Between the nozzle, which more than doubled the effective range of a Jet, and MAC, Halea was confident that she’d have a distinct edge over the other competitors.

The club had never won the tournament, though both Halea and Victorina had come close, and we all hoped that this would be the year it happened.

Tournaments and healing magic aside, I decided on two more avenues of research before heading back to the clubhouse. First, was to see if I could find some spells or literature on more controlled electrical magic. I was fairly sure that I could create a custom spell to charge my phone without too much trouble. It would be easier though, if I found a spell to work from, rather than trying to modify lightning bolt to the point where it wouldn’t blast my phone into fragments. The other avenue of research was to read up on the events surrounding the cursing of the Prefecture of Ariros guild hall. Most importantly, I needed that stasis spell. Every second would count when it came time to lift the curse, and if I could cut minutes off of the time the wraith had to attack, then I was going to do whatever I could to locate and learn that spell.

-----

I got lucky with the electrical spells, I guess when there’s a couple thousand years of Mages casting spells, most things get tried at least once. I found a book, really just a collection of notes, by a Wizard that had done some experimentation with conductivity. It was incredibly rudimentary, and reminded me of Ancient Greek experiments with steam power. He didn’t seem to get very far in his research, the fact that he was a Wizard and might take years to invent any spell, probably didn’t make life easy for him, but there was some good stuff here. He hadn’t come up with quantitative values, but he did have qualitative rankings for several materials based on their conductivity. There were even some sketches of what looked like a light bulb, though it lacked the actual glass bulb, and by his notes was made of iron. In any case, there was enough written here to help me skip over most of the legwork, which I appreciated.

I, with great trepidation, set the book back down.

I still had research to do on the curse, and besides, I didn’t have time to sit and learn the spells just then. I knew where the book was, and it still bore that little magic stamp, so I’d be able to find it again afterwards. I didn’t want to do it, but I had more work to do first.

I was much less lucky with my research into the Prefecture of Ariros. There was very little of consequence written on the subject, much of it was speculation, and even the most objective text I located was little more than an analysis and comparison of the rumours and legends surrounding the guild hall. These were, at best, third and fourth hand accounts, which referenced texts that I couldn’t even locate. I was essentially the newest participant in a game of telephone that had been running for a thousand years, and I had a distinct lack of primary or even secondary sources.

What I did find, however, was an obvious adventure hook.

The Library, and the University by extension, was not one for burning books. This meant that they took any texts that they found objectionable, Time and Necromancy spells especially, and locked them away. The southeast tower of the Library held this collection of books, and was referred to as the ‘Restricted Collection’. Of course, this was nonsense.

*Restricted Collection? These Nimeran Mages can’t name anything right, it should clearly be called the Forbidden Tower.*

The original copy of the Ariros stasis enchantment was, according to rumour, in this collection. I was unsure about the validity of this rumour, but the text that collated all of the rumours seemed to suggest that it was at least partly true. It was certainly possible that the text had been moved, or that the book had simply deteriorated to the point of illegibility, but it was the closest thing I had to a lead.

*Should I break into a restricted area of the Library, risk setting off magical defenses that I can’t comprehend or even notice, just so I can maybe learn a spell that might help to possibly, maybe, lift the curse? I dunno, that was a pretty big castle…*

And it wasn’t **just** a castle, lifting the curse would effectively catapult me into the nobility. I claimed relation to an Emperor, but that wasn’t quite the same thing as actually having a title, even if that title was as simple as a double-county.

Even if the original copy of the stasis enchantment wasn’t there, it might be the only place where I’d be able to find an alternative. After all, according to what I’d been told, I needed to know at least a variant of the enchantment to have any hope of dispelling it. So I could either break in and risk expulsion if caught, or I could wander around the unsorted part of the Library until I stumbled across what I needed. Breaking in was risky, but the alternative might take more time than the club had. Rushing in would help no one, but I resolved to at least do some research into the sorts of defences that the Forbidden Tower had.

*This whole curse lifting thing is getting more complicated all the time.*

# Chapter 38

Quinn

-----

“So, how many of these courses am I allowed to take?” I asked, as I looked at the enrolment form that Lili had given me.

“As many as you’d like Quinn, at least, as long as none take place at the same time,” she replied.

*No time turners then, damn.*

“Actually, I was thinking more about how many Victorina will let me take before she starts yelling at me,” I said, looking at Victorina out of the corner of my eye.

She rolled her eyes, “Oh don’t you start with me again.”

“Fine, fine,” I said, ”I’ll restrain myself. No more than twelve hours of class a day.”

“What sort of monster have you brought me Lili?” she asked, head in hands.

“Do humans normally work such long hours?” Lili asked, seeming interested.

“I’m just teasing Victorina, but no, not usually,” I explained, “The normal human work day is eight hours, five days a week, and in university my classes were more or less on that schedule as well.”

“Sounds like that human endurance at work,” Lili said, “Employers that force their employees to work eight hours a day are usually considered to be excessive and cruel. Four is more normal, and six is usually considered to be the reasonable limit.”

*Four hours a day? Damn. I never really considered what elven endurance, or the lack of it, might do to the work day. I bet that’s got something to do with their reduced population too, you can only farm so much food if everyone is working half days.*

“For humans it’s roughly double those numbers, though we also get a second day off. I’ve even had jobs where I worked ten hour days, but I also got a third day off work, so I didn’t mind too much. I might actually take eight hours or so of classes, depending on what I’ve got here,” I said, scanning the sheet.

“As long as it’s eight and not eigh**teen**,” Victorina grumbled.

Lili looked at me, eyebrow raised, “Eighteen?”

I waved a hand, “Victorina gave me that big speech about working hard, I guess I just interpreted that rather differently than Victorina had intended.”

“Hey! You said double those numbers for a human, which means that sixteen hour days are considered cruel for a human,” Victorina challenged, “You were putting **yourself** through that, and more besides.”

I shrugged, “I suppose I went a little overboard, but on the other hand, **MAGIC.** Even Sila, who lived most of her life in the same tiny village, seemed to take magic in stride. You’ve all lived your lives in a world where magic, if not an everyday occurrence, was at least present in your lives, even before you became Mages. For me though? Magic was only found in fantasy novels, of which I read many, and that was it. Suddenly being able to do magic is incredible, hell Victorina, you’re lucky I was sleeping at all.”

“I suppose I never really thought of it like that,” Victorina acknowledged, “Could you please restrain yourself though? Eight hours sounds like plenty, Quinn.”

I nodded, “I’ll keep things reasonable,” I promised.

Victorina left on some errand, and I spent an hour or so going over my options and selecting my courses with Lili. Each course consisted of two four hour classes per week, which with the reduced elven endurance, meant that most elves took three courses per week. Victorina and the rest of her club followed this convention, though then they’d come back to the clubhouse and do a couple more hours of studying with Lili afterwards. I opted for four courses packed into four days, instead of the usual three courses over six days, which gave me more free time for some of the projects I had planned.

I took courses on Battle Magic, Enchantment, Spell Invention, and Healing. Lili would also be tutoring me in magical theory on the side. Theory didn’t seem quite as interesting as my other courses, but I really needed the background information if I was going to get a solid grasp of magic, and I could see it helping a lot with my future projects. I didn’t want to get half way through building my magical steam engine, only to find that there was some little nugget of theory that I was unaware of, that invalidated the whole thing.

-----

I spent the late afternoon and early evening reading up on what enchantment texts I could find in the club’s library. I had plans to heal my hands, and possibly even my eyes, using the arena to do the test runs, but enchantment offered solutions as well. They weren’t quite as good as a full healing would be, but enchantment was also more likely to work. With the healing I was essentially relying on the magic to pull the relevant information out of my subconscious, which seemed dodgy at best. I was more confident about enchantment working, even if it was a less perfect solution. Gloves with Apportation and some sort of feeling enchantment permanently cast would do for my hands, and permanent illusions would make a much better lens than the low quality glass I could find or make here in Nimre.

The first thing I discovered was that enchantment was a very broad subject. Enchantment covered anything that was permanent or semi-permanent, which meant that as a school or college or magic, it was nearly as big as all the other colleges put together. I was already aware of wands and staves as foci for spellcasting, but such devices could also be enchanted further. At the most basic level, and enchanted wand or staff would carry a spell, Fireball for example. Then any Mage or Wizard who picked up that wand would be able to cast the spell, even if they didn’t know it. They’d still need to provide the energy for it themselves, but they could cast the spell just as if they knew it. From there it was a sliding scale. Additional enchantments could be added to reduce, or even eliminate, the energy requirements placed upon the user, just as if the user had known the spell very well. It was also possible to set a mana stone into the item, and have the enchantment draw its power from the stone. This was a fairly cheap addition if small stones were used, though it was limited, since the stones took time to recharge.

The embedded mana stone option had another benefit though, it let anyone use the wand, not just a Wizard or Mage. Large mana stones did get exponentially more expensive, and you could only really embed one stone, but it was a definite option for the non-spellcasting populace.

*Now I know why enchanters can make so much money. If I was some noble or wealthy merchant, I’d love to have a Wand of Fireball in my back pocket for emergencies.*

There were other sorts of enchantments of course, of the sort that were more constant, rather than the sort that cast a given spell on command. An example would be the armouring enchantment on my robes, and most of these could draw passively from ambient mana. For those enchantments that required more power, it was also possible to lay on additional enchantments that could actively draw from the ambient mana, though they got very complicated and very expensive very quickly.

Complex I could handle, that was mostly a matter of learning the spell. Expensive though, that was a different matter. I had a big pile of money in the bank, hell, I’d figured out the relative purchasing power of a drachm to a dollar, and it gave me a good idea of just how **much** money I had. One drachm, was about equivalent to fourteen dollars. Canadian dollars, but they were dollars all the same. This meant that the University was paying me nearly twenty seven thousand dollars a month, which was an incredible amount of money, especially when you considered the roughly seven hundred thousand dollars I had in the bank. None of that mattered when it came to enchantment though, or at least, it didn’t help directly.

‘Expensive’ meant energy, not dollars, and not drachm.

A mana stone took only twenty mana to enchant, but when it came to ‘proper’ enchantments, even the most simple called for a minimum of fifty energy. Most were even more than that though, and were somewhere in the two to five hundred range. Now I did have a lot of energy to throw around, but mana stones aside, even the simplest stuff would require all of my enervation and a decent chunk of vitality. The solution then was to bring friends, and that’s what most enchanters did. The limit on enchantment then, was how many friends you could include, and how much each of them had to contribute. At first I imagined a situation where I convinced half the University to all chip in on some great plot of mine, but that wasn’t actually feasible. There was a limit on how many people could be part of a group casting, and that set a fairly hard cap on how much mana could go into any one enchantment. A less talented Mage, with little knowledge of the spell could probably support a group consisting of themselves and one other. A talented Mage like myself could probably support a group of three or four people, including myself. Serious enchanters, Mages who did this sort of thing professionally, were somewhere in the five to seven range. Twelve was considered the absolute limit, and was achievable only by very few. According to Victorina, Neferoy was notable for being able to support groups of eight.

There were workaround for this limit, though it mostly consisted of Mages bringing along mana stones and the like. Truly massive enchantments though, those took time. Enchantments that were small enough could be done by a group in a few hours, but larger ones could take years. Rather than dump all the energy in at once, the Mage would provide just a little bit, once a day, every day, for months, or years. One energy, took one Mage-day. So an enchantment that took five hundred energy, took five hundred Mage-days. You could bring in friends, just as with the quicker style of enchantment, but it only did so much. With an average enchanting circle of six people, a five hundred energy enchantment still took three months, which was **way** too long to wait, as far as I was concerned.

It also meant that there was a huge jump in price around the seventy energy range. When your average enchanting circle is six elves with twelve mana each, the limit on what could be enchanted quickly was about seventy mana. More than that and most enchanting circles would need to take the slower method. This did mean that more skilled enchanters, such as Neferoy, had a huge advantage though. A circle led by Neferoy could do in a couple hours, what took other circles a couple of weeks. It was a fairly narrow margin, between what the smaller circles had to do slowly, and what became too expensive energy wise for Neferoy to do quickly, but then most profits are made in the margins.

*Hell, I can push that limit up a bit higher with all the enervation I can draw upon, more even if I use some vitality. I’ll need to find out what the club normally enchants for profit, they’ve got to be doing this sort of thing already, especially if Victorina’s main concern is financial stability.*

I was drawn out of my thoughts by Minki tugging on my sleeve, “Excuse me, Quinn.”

“What is it Minki?” I asked, setting my book aside.

“Um, if it’s not too much trouble, do you think you could make dinner for m- the club?” She asked shyly.

I smiled, “Sure, was there anything in particular you had in mind?”

She clasped her hands under her chin, “I do really like pizza.”

“Pizza it is then,” I said, standing up, “Has anyone else eaten yet?”

She shook her head, causing her grey hair to fly around, “I don’t think so.”

“Alright, I will need some more of the cheese though, do you think you could go get some for me while I make the dough?” I asked.

She nodded, “What sort of cheese is it?”

“Uh,” I hesitated, “I can’t remember what it is elves call it, on Earth it’s called mozzarella, just tell Maci that you need some of Quinn’s pizza cheese, she’ll know what that means. Here,” I said, handing her the little silver University broach.

Her grey eyes got **very** wide, and she took it gingerly, “Are you sure Quinn?” she asked, uncertainly.

I shrugged, “I trust you, and besides, it’s not fair to expect you to pay for it when you’re trying to put some money away for when your parents try to call you home.”

She nodded, and then frowned, “Don’t remind me,” she said quietly, “I’m going to need to go to that silly ball, with whoever it is they’ve tried to set me up with.”

I raised my eyebrows, “You don’t know who it is yet?”

“No,” she said in her small, mousey voice, and I was struck by how melancholy she usually seemed. The grey hair and grey eyes did a lot to add to the effect, and I found myself feeling a little protective of her.

“Hopefully this will be the only time,” I said gently, “If Victorina’s planned things right, then you’ll get to make those decisions for yourself in the future.”

“I hope so,” she said, as we left the library.

-----

Victorina caught me in the kitchen a short time later, having returned from her errand.

“Pizza?” She asked, as she entered, “Good, I’m starving. It took ages for The Mercers to finally cut to the chase, and they weren’t generous enough to provide dinner while they spent ages talking my ear off.”

“Mercers?” I asked, “Is that who you were off seeing?”

She nodded, “Still trying to negotiate some sort of agreement with one of the guilds. The Mercers consist mostly of the children of merchant families, so I’d hoped that they wouldn’t feel as entitled to our ‘gratitude’ as the nobles might be, and maybe that is the case, but I wasn’t convinced by my meeting with them.”

“Pardon me if I’m being insensitive,” I said, “This is obviously not the sort of problem I’ve ever had to deal with, but is it that bad?”

She grimaced, “No, it’s not nearly as bad as I’m making it sound, at least with The Mercers. Some of the other guilds, the Order of the Claves in particular, have been known to take advantage of peasant girls though. And more than one guild has been accused of letting in the less talented and less privileged of the female Mages in exchange for ‘favours’,” she sighed, “It’s just one big mess.”

I nodded, “I can understand that. Well, if all goes well, we can make our own guild. And you’ll be able to extract ‘favours’ out of strapping young elf men in exchange for being let into the guild.”

She tilted her head down just a little, and looked at me with narrowed eye, “Please, Thera and Halea might be the ones to flaunt it, but do you really think that I’d need to coerce **anyone** into doing **anything** with me. For example, would you refuse if I asked you to attend the ball with me?”

“Uh, not to contradict you, however, am I required to go?” I asked, “I don’t know a damned thing about local etiquette, and I have never danced in my entire life.”

She raised her eyebrows, “Thera mentioned that you’re not fond of dancing, but yes, you are expected to attend. Anyone with rank is expected to be there, and most of the wealthier merchant families will be present as well.”

*I should have kept my damned mouth shut about Charlemange.*

“However, if you attended the ball with myself, you might be able to get away with abstaining from dancing,” she said.

“That sounds perfect,” I said, genuinely pleased, “Is there anything in particular I need to wear?”

“Your robes are quite enough,” she explained, “Though you’ll want to wear the longer set, and a proper pair of formal trousers.”

I nodded, “I’ve got a couple such pairs, I’ll make sure they’re all nicely pressed for the big day. Anything else I need to be ready for?”

“Nothing in particular. You’re going to be a quiet and handsome accessory, while I walk around and make nice with the nobles. You don’t even need to say a word.”

*Accessory? As in fashion accessory, or accessory to murder?*

“Good, I guess?”

“Maybe you’ll want to growl a little if it looks like someone is going to come ask me to dance,” she teased.

“Are you also not a fan of dancing?” I asked, and I shredded the cheese that Minki had brought back for me.

“I enjoy it actually, but the ball only goes on so long, and I don’t often get the chance to speak to most of the people that will be present.”

“Makes sense I suppose, and I’m sure as hell going to take any opportunity to avoid a dance if I can manage it.”

Victorina smiled wryly, “I’m a little disappointed actually, Thera said that you’d fall at my feet, this is a little lackluster by comparison.”

“Oh get out you,” I said, gesturing violently with a wooden spoon.

“You can’t chase me out of my own-” She started.

I motioned as if to flick the spoon at her, to splatter her with sauce, and she beat a hasty retreat.

------

I woke the following morning to a heavy rain beating against the windows to my room, and used a manipulator to open the balcony doors just a crack. I enjoyed the sound and the smell that came through the now open door, and welcomed the approach of colder weather. It was nearing the beginning of fall, and I could certainly see that in the weather. I followed my normal morning routine, I took a quick bath, shaved, and brushed my teeth.

*I’ll need to plumb in a shower at some point, taking a bath every morning is a little excessive.*

No one else was awake by the time I’d gotten up, so I left quietly, and had breakfast at a small café near the University Library. I was glad for the rain, between it and the relatively early hour, both the café and the Library were rather empty.

I finished my breakfast quickly, and tracked down the book I’d found yesterday so as to pick up where I’d left off with electrical magic. I had ten days, not including the ball, until classes started. I wanted to have my phone charged and working by that time, and hopefully ten days would be enough time to learn and alter the spells to that end. In some ways my belt was nearly as good at information storage as my phone, especially since it could call the appropriate item to hand at any time, but my phone had cameras, calculators, and all sorts of other useful features that I might find helpful in my studies.

*I’ve even got five years’ worth of textbooks from U of T on that thing. I can think of a couple places where a university level physics textbook might come in useful. Damn, I’ve even got that Military History textbook, I wonder if it includes the formula for smokeless powder. Now there would be one hell of a way to one-up Uncle Mike. Skip right from muzzle loading matchlocks, and introduce cartridge firing bolt action rifles. If guild hierarchs are supposed to be somewhere between a Count and a Duke, and they hold about that much land, then I might want some sort of non-magical military force anyway. Professional soldiers with bolt actions might be the way to do it, it would be a hell of a lot more effective than trying to levy men from whatever handful of villages exist in the guild’s territories.*

I found a cosy little couch set into a bay window, and stretched out on it to read the journal. I largely ignored the notes on resistance and conductivity, and focused on his power generation spell specifically. His collected figures on conductivity and electrical resistance were pretty impressive considering the local level of technology, but they didn’t offer a whole lot when I had computer hardware and physics textbooks waiting for me once I got my phone powered. I was somewhat disappointed in the lack of an enchantment equivalent to the spell he’d created, but the spell would be enough for most of my needs. If I got as much power out of this spell as I did out of Apportation, I could expect one energy to buy me about fifty five watts at one amp, which was about eleven times what I needed to charge my phone.

I was about half way through learning the spell when my studies were interrupted by two sets of light footsteps. I’d taken my glasses off to read, since they’d only give me a headache, and I looked up to see two blurry figures. One had long brown hair, big brown eyes, and wore neat light blue robes. The other had a tangle of grey hair, grey eyes, and rumpled brown robes.

“Morning,” I said, greeting Minki and Sila, “How did you two end up here?”

“Oh, I was going to your clubhouse to see if you were in, and I caught Minki here as she was leaving,” Sila piped up, excited as always, “I asked if it would be okay to go in and see you, but she said that you’d left for the Library. So I tagged along to come see you.”

“You were coming to look for me Minki?” I asked.

She nodded, “Mmm hmm, I was interested in the electrical magic you mentioned to me at dinner, I wanted to come see if you’d like some help.”

“Sure,” I said, stretching languidly, and then standing up, “Let’s find somewhere we can sit.”

Sila followed closely at my heels, with Minki trailing a little behind, as I found one of the small tables that I’d passed on my way to the couch. I set the book on the table, along with the few notes that I’d made while studying the spell, and dropped into one of the chairs. Sila scuttled into the chair next to me, and Minki sat down across from me.

“What is it Sila?” I asked, seeing that she seemed to have something that she wanted to say.

“Why does there have to be anything?” She asked, “Maybe I just wanted to say hi.”

I just raised an eyebrow.

“Fine,” she said, “I was just wondering if maybe you were looking for someone to accompany you to the ball. I feel bad that you always ended up with some chore to do during Feastdays back in Essens, and that we never got the chance to dance together. This would be the perfect chance, since now you haven’t got to work Pell’s forge or anything. It’ll be so much fun Quinn!”

*Dammit.*

“Actually Sila,” I said gently, “I’ve already promised Victorina that I’d attend the ball with her.”

“Oh,” Sila said flatly, “Maybe some other time.”

*No.*

I shrugged, “Yeah, maybe. You’re not expected to go though, are you Sila?”

“Actually I can’t go, not unless someone with standing takes me with them,” she said, casting a look at the purple trim on my hoodie-robe, “What about your lectrical magic then? What’s that about?” she asked, forcing a less disappointed tone.

And so the three of us set to work on the power generation spell, or at least, Minki and I did. Sila tried her best. She seemed excited at the proposition of learning and practicing magic with me, but she was out of her depth, both magically and intellectually. Now Sila was by no means stupid, I’d noticed fairly early on that she was actually pretty bright. The trouble was her total lack of education. She ‘knew her numbers’, and I’d taught her to read back in Essens, but that was a far cry from understanding the theory behind what I was trying to explain. Minki on the other hand was already familiar with Ohm’s law, it was one of the formulas I’d written out on that chalkboard during my impromptu math lesson to the club. By comparison, Sila had a hard time understanding multiplication and division. She’d probably learn fairly quickly, but it wasn’t something I could teach in a couple hours.

Besides, I didn’t really want to sit and teach her how to multiply and divide. What I wanted to do was learn the spell that would allow me to provide power to the single most powerful computer on the damn planet, and it took an effort not to get irritated when she’d ask questions about the simplest things, things that Minki and I had already internalized. I knew she was fairly bright, but she was also missing a lifetime of education, study, and tutoring. This wasn’t a gap that could be closed with a few hours in the University Library, or any other library for that matter.

*She’s my oldest friend in this world, she nursed me back to health after I nearly died, and she’s incredibly cute. And yet… And yet I just want her to leave me alone with Minki.*

I wasn’t quite so lucky though, and Sila stuck around until well after lunchtime. Guilt forced down my initial feelings of resentment though. I could be somewhat cruel sometimes, and of all the people I knew, Sila deserved that the least. I’d made her cry more than once, and despite all that, all my cold and ambivalent treatment, she kept coming back for more, chipper as ever.

It did take longer to learn the spell with Sila present, as she did her best to keep up, which mostly involved asking more slightly irritating questions. Minki was also a little behind, though that was due more to my head start than anything else. We wrapped up around midafternoon, by which point even Sila’s cheerfulness was starting to fade. By elven standards we’d just spent all of a full working day studying the spell, plus a little more, and it showed. Minki was in somewhat better shape, since she was used to the longer hours that Victorina supported, but she was also getting to the point where she’d also want to stop soon. We called it there, and I resolved to return with Minki tomorrow so that she’d be able to finish learning the spell.

It was as we were leaving the Library, that Sila asked a somewhat uncomfortable question, “So what are we going to do now Quinn? Do you have time to see father? He asked me about how you’ve been doing here in Nimre, he’d probably like to talk to you.”

I glanced over at Minki, while I tried to think of some excuse to get me out of this, but Minki boxed me in.

“It’s okay,” she said quietly, “Go with your friend Quinn.”

Sila actually jumped up a little at this, “Perfect,” she said happily, “We can have supper together and everything, just like old times.”

Minki left without saying another word, with just a small wave of the fingers to say goodbye, as Sila took my arm and dragged me away.

Do read the chapter first though.


# Chapter 39

Sila

-----

Quinn had put his spectacles on at some point during our walk, and was looking around, peering at buildings and such as I led him back to the tavern where father and I were staying. He looked almost like an owl, twisting his head all around like that, and the circles of glass looked like big owly eyes.

“Sila,” he started, almost hesitantly, “Aren’t you getting a bursary from the University?”

I **was** getting a bursary, and it was a lot of money, a lot a lot. Four hundred and eighty drachm, every single month. Just the first month’s bursary had been more money than I’d ever seen at one time.

“Mmm hmm, why do you ask?” I replied.

“Well, it just seems like you might want to live in a nicer part of the city, now that you’ve got the money to do so,” Quinn said.

“What’s wrong with this part of the city?” I asked, feeling strangely hurt at the comment, “Everywhere else in the city is so much more expensive than home.”

“This part of town might not be any more expensive than Essens,” he said evenly, “But you must have noticed that it’s a whole lot rougher.”

“You don’t like it here?” I asked, *what about the village, was that ‘rough’ too?*

“It’s… perfectly fine,” he hedged, “It just seems like you’ve got better options now that the University is paying you a bursary.”

*Better options? Oh you are such a silly little girl Sila, you should have realized. He didn’t live in Essens because he liked it, he did it because he had too. You can see how he dresses, and you saw that clubhouse. How could anyone that lives in a place like that, settle for a place like this?*

Even Baron Polepho would look plainly dressed compared to Quinn. Quinn’s mage robes were made of the finest silk that I’d ever seen, and the colour was perfect. It wasn’t faded one bit, with no dark or light patches from dye that had been applied unevenly. Not even the Baron had managed that, there was always a little splotchyness, or a little bit of fading. That had always seemed perfectly normal though, and it’s not until I saw what Quinn was wearing, that I realized I’d been so wrong.

My mage robes were linen instead of silk, and while his were expertly dyed deep shades of indigo and purple, mine were light blue, with some spots lighter or darker than others where the dye hadn’t been put on evenly. I’d barely noticed the uneven colour when I’d first put them on, and I just thought that the robes were the nicest thing that I’d ever worn. The sad part was that it was true, my mage robes were far nicer than my Feastday best, and even still I looked like a silly peasant girl standing next to Quinn.

The clubhouse was even worse. I’d been afraid to sit on the furniture when Quinn first led me to one of the small sitting rooms. ‘Small’, well Quinn had called it small. It was nearly as big as the whole common room in father’s tavern, and it wasn’t even the largest sitting room in the clubhouse. The furniture was also better than anything the Baron had. I’d seen his manor more than once, whenever he’d host the Feastday, and I’d always thought that it was the most impressive place I’d ever seen. When Moss would tell the story of Enmelos and the Beetle, I always imagined that the Emperor’s palace looked just like the Baron’s manor, except maybe a little bit bigger.

Compared to that sitting room though, the Baron’s furniture wasn’t fit for kindling. The Baron’s furniture was really just the same sort of furniture that we had at the inn, with maybe a little more scrollwork and embroidery. The furniture in the clubhouse on the other hand was so richly upholstered and well crafted that I’d been afraid to even touch it, for fear of getting it dirty. Before seeing Victorina’s clubhouse I wouldn’t have ever imagined that a place so luxurious existed, and Quinn seemed to take it all for granted, as if it was all perfectly normal.

And Victorina. Everything I’d heard about her from the other girls said that she was a cruel taskmistress, an awful slave driver, and a wanton harlot. She worked her club members to death, discarded them when they couldn’t keep up any more, and dressed like a strumpet. Her robes were cut so low that her bosom might as well have been bare, and they were fit so closely that you could clearly see every curve and line of her body. Her hair, skin, teeth, everything, it was all perfect. Her hair had a sheen like a sheet of silver, her skin was a flawless and pale white, her teeth all stood as straight as soldiers, and looked like they might be made of porcelain. She might have been a marble statue, and was dressed every bit as well as Quinn. My hair was a dull brown and full of split ends, working in the sun had tanned and roughened my skin, and my teeth hadn’t gotten any better. They were still crooked and slightly yellowed, and it was a small mercy that I hadn’t lost any more of them. Father said you couldn’t notice the couple missing ones unless you looked really close, but I bet Quinn noticed. She was the daughter of an Emperor, and was one of the most talented Mages in the whole University. I barely even have the talent to be allowed into a club, and was just a silly little village girl.

*And she has her hooks right into Quinn. I barely see him now, but he’s sees* ***her*** *every single day, as she struts around half naked. He’s going to the ball with her on his arm, when I didn’t even get to dance with him on one single Feastday. It’s just not fair. How must she treat him? After everything I’ve heard about her, how can he stay there? I took care of him when he was the weakest of the weak, I was there when he needed it the most. I even helped him get to the water closet when he was too weak to stand on his own. She’d never find the kindness to do that for him, she’d just throw him away if he was that weak. It’s just not right, that’s not how it works in any of Moss’s stories. The dashing prince never saved the princess, only for her to run off with the villain at the end of the tale. No, they lived happily ever after, because the princess was so grateful at being saved.*

I walked quietly along with Quinn for almost a mile before it struck me, before it figured it out. I was being silly, but not in the way I thought. I wasn’t at the end of the story, I was at the beginning. Quinn was still with the villain because no one had saved him yet. It **was** just like the tale of Enmelos and the Beetle. After Enmelos helped the beautiful Princess Deine when her carriage broke a wheel, she didn’t elope with him right then, she continued on to the Emperor’s palace. It’s only then that Enmelos realized that he had to save her, and this was just the same. Even the accident was the same, after all Quinn had said that his big metal box was just a type of carriage hadn’t he? Besides, I’d only just got my magic powers, and it didn’t make sense for the hero to get the power to defeat the villain only after it was all over, that’s not how it worked. First the hero had to meet the princess and discover that they were in peril. But what could they do about it? **They were just a simple peasant.** It was only after they’d given up hope of saving their princess that they’d discover their powers or find the ancient sword or whatever, and then they had to go off on a quest to learn how to use what they’d discovered.

*Enmelos spent ten whole years training with his magic bow, and it wasn’t until after he killed the Giant Dire Beetle that he finally knew he was ready to go back and save Princess Deine. I’m going to do exactly the same thing.*

Quinn always told me that the best way to solve a problem was to break it into steps, and then take them on one at a time, so that was exactly what I was going to do. The first thing was to find myself a club, whatever it took, and find father a nicer place to stay. Quinn was right, I had money now, more money than I’d ever had, and I didn’t need to be so worried about saving it all. Next I’d study, and study a lot. I had to keep a vigil though, just like Enmelos did, and strike at the villain whenever I had the chance so I could weaken them before the final battle. Then I’d find and slay a horrible monster, to show my prince just how devoted I was, and because it would scare the villain. I’d probably want to find a horrible monster that was guarding a treasure too, whatever the treasure was, it always came in handy when fighting the villain. Only then could I strike down the villain, and save my prince.

Quinn

-----

“So who’s competing today?” I asked, as I made breakfast, “From our club I mean.”

“Well I am,” Halea provided.

“So am I,” Victorina added, “And I think Minki is as well.”

“Minki?” I asked in surprise, turning from the stove to look at where Victorina and Halea were leaning on the kitchen island, “Seriously?”

“Why are you so shocked Quinn?” Halea asked, “Wasn’t she the one to ask you about inventing a new spell in time for the tournament?”

“Well, yeah, I suppose. I guess you didn’t feel the need to talk **her** down, now did you Victorina?” I said, turning back to the stove.

“Aww,” Halea cooed, “Is the big strong man feeling jealous? Does the tiny little girl fighting your battles for you make you feel a little emasculated?”

“He’s even cooking for us,” Victorina cackled, “He’s here playing homemaker, while we busy ourselves with the important work of supporting the club, and defeating the scawy cousin Andrew. I think you ought to learn some cleaning spells too Quinn, us breadwinners have got more important things to do than to keep things tidy.”

“Why don’t we just leave him here while we go to the tournament? It might be too violent for his delicate sensibilities,” Halea teased.

“I think you’re right Halea. I really only need him to hang off my arm and look pretty for the ball after all, no sense in bringing him to the tournament. Now Quinn,” she said sternly, “I expect there to be cold beer and a meal waiting for us once we get back for lunch, disappoint me and you’ll feel the back of my hand.”

There was a creak of floorboards as someone else stepped through the threshold and into the kitchen, and Brandy spoke, “Are you sure it’s a good idea to tease Quinn like that? He’s an awful lot bigger than either of you.”

“Oh he’s harmless,” Halea said, before slapping me hard on the ass.

“Hey!” I yelped, and the three of them started laughing.

“Alright, that’s enough,” I said, turning around and swiped at Halea.

She tried to slip away, but then I wasn't using my hands, I was using Apportation.  She was stronger than she looked, like all elves, but I'd put a fair amount of energy behind the spell. I ducked down as I pulled her in, and wrapped both of my arms around her waist as I straightened. She got hauling up off the ground and I threw her over my shoulder.

“Put me down!” she howled, as she pounded on my back with her little fists.

I ignored her, as the other two were set to fits of giggling. I did my best to herd the other two out of the kitchen and into the sitting room while I struggled to keep my grip on Halea’s wriggling form.

Minki and Brandy were the only other two up this early, and both were still in their pyjamas. Brandy in her pink flannels, and Minki in pink silk. Brandy had been up for some time, but Minki looked like she had just rolled out of bed. Her hair was a tangled mess, even more so than usual, and she rubbed at her eyes sleepily.

“Is breakfast almos-“ Minki started to ask, before pulling her hands away from her eyes, and looking up in shock.

“Couple more minutes,” I said nonchalantly, before tossing Halea down on one of the couches as she howled in protest.

I returned to the kitchen, and pushed the door shut behind me so I could finish preparing breakfast without the interference of the giggling gaggle of girls.

-----

“So how many contestants are there for this thing?” I asked, as I settled into my seat.

I found myself wishing for a cold coke, and maybe some sort of candy, as I sat in the stands with the others. In a society where movies and Netflix didn’t exist, there were few options for the sort of long form entertainment that I was used to, and this or the theater was about as close as it got. There were even concession stands, even if there was no coke, popcorn, or candy, so I had to settle for the local equivalents. I passed on the wine and ale that was offered, I didn’t drink often, and certainly not this early in the morning, but I did purchase several kebabs.

*I suppose that’s one benefit to using Apportation all the time, no messy hands.*

“I haven’t seen the final tournament bracket yet,” Victorina hedged, “But now that there’s forty odd clubs, there’s probably going to be fifty something contestants today.”

“I guess some more clubs got formed in the past couple days?” I asked.

“Yes, we got several more students in at the start of the semester, and there’s always some reorganization in the older clubs. People get fed up with their partners, and leave to try to put together new teams, that sort of thing.”

*Hopefully Sila found some place to stay. And hopefully their clubhouse is as far away as possible.*

We were all there a little early, those of us that had come along at least. Halea, Minki, and Victorina were all along because they’d be competing, and I tagged along so I could see the MAC spell tested in actual combat. Or at least, as close to actual combat as I was likely to get any time soon. The others were either off meeting their families and preparing for the coming ball, or weren’t expected to attend the ball, and were likely going to the parties or get togethers that were hosted by and for the less prestigious families.

*Seems to me like the peasants and merchants have the better deal here, I’ve never been comfortable at house parties, but I’d rather be at one of those than some formal ball.*

It was a nice day, all in all. The weather was clear, and it was just the right temperature for me to wear my hoodie and not feel too warm. I rather liked the autumn, and the homecoming tournament and ball marked its first day. Of course, I don’t think the others saw it that way, since they were all wearing what passed for a jacket in the Greco-Victorian mishmash that Elardia called a culture. We’d gotten very good seats, and were sitting mere feet from the wall that kept clumsy elves and humans from falling to the arena floor.

We chatted for a bit, as we waited for the arena to fill up, and for a tournament brackets to be finalized. It didn’t take long at all for things to get crowded, with eager students and the servants of nobles trying to be the first to claim the best seats.

*Seems like they ought to work out some reserved seating arrangement, so the nobles don’t need to send their servants ahead for them.* ***Or,*** *I hire a bunch of bored labourers in time for the next tournament, and sell the seats that they reserve for me at a big mark-up. Now there’s an idea.*

A steward brought the girls their tournament brackets a short time later, much to Minki’s consternation.

“It’ll be fine Minki,” Victorina reassured her, as Minki clutched at the arm rests of her seat with a white knuckled grip, “Just stick to the plan, and we shouldn’t have any trouble placing highly.”

“Plan?” I asked, “What plan?”

“Well,” Victorina said, double checking her bracket, “The plan is to keep the MAC spell under wraps until as late in the tournament as we can manage. The fact that we all got byes does help a lot, so that’s the first round done with straight away. Second round we’ll fight as if everything is normal, without drawing upon the MAC spell. The third round is when we’ll unleash our surprise, and by that point we’ll each only have three more rounds to go.”

“Assuming you win them all,” I pointed out.

“Which might be a problem,” Halea said, “We’ve all got byes, yes, but look how the **rest** of the bracket is set up. Whoever wrote this thing was not kind to us, bye or not. See?” Halea asked, pointing out a specific section, and I peered over Victorina’s shoulder to get a second look.

“Damn,” Victorina said, “Damn and double damn. And Minki is… yeah, I see the problem Halea.”

The problem was that the three of them had all been packed in rather tightly. Assuming that the two little marks next to each person’s name were club and guild crests, then in the few cases where one club or guild sent multiple people, they were fairly well spread out through the bracket. This meant that in almost every case two clubmates wouldn’t fight each other unless they both made it to the quarter finals, with one notable exception, our club. If Halea and Victorina both won their first match, then they’d be facing each other in the round immediately following. Worse still, if Minki won her own matches, then she’d face whichever of the other two won their match. It didn’t help that they’d been put up against some of the stronger opponents either, assuming things played out as I imagined. I didn’t recognize either of the people that would fight the first round to see who got matched against Thera in the second, but I recognized Victorina’s and Minki’s likely match ups. Victorina would likely find herself matched against Diova Tanaka, the elf who had tried to recruit me to his club, and the son of the family that owned the clubhouse we stayed in.

*Hell, if I interpreted things correctly, he might be the one that personally owns the clubhouse.*

Minki on the other hand, would likely find herself competing against Andrew and his acid magic. Granted, both Diova and Andrew would need to win their first rounds since they didn’t have the benefit of a bye, but it wasn’t hard to imagine that happening.

“I can understand the desire to get the uppity women out of the picture as quickly as possible, but why award all three of you byes?” I asked, not particularly happily.

Victorina sighed, leaning back in her chair, “In the rare cases where women compete, which basically means, when we compete, we tend to get byes automatically if they’re available. It’s part of how the University organizes the tournaments. The first round of match ups tends to be fairly one sided, since the organizers usually match the strongest Mages against the weakest, and then our first matches are usually against some of the strongest people in the university.”

I shrugged, “The strongest-to-weakest I can understand at least, tournaments on Earth often run the same way. Match two of the best and two of the weakest against each other in the first round, and a strong team gets eliminated earlier than they really deserve, and a weaker team makes it further than they really should. Better to get the unbalanced match ups out of the way early.”

“Well yes,” Halea said, “And you can see that here,” she pointed to Diova’s match up, “Diova’s opponent, Andrew’s too actually, has absolutely no chance. Those matches will both be over in a couple of minutes, I guarantee it. Minki might not end up fighting Andrew though, since he does need to fight that second match against a real opponent before he might find himself fighting Minki, but he’s probably still going to win that one too. Victorina is definitely going to fight her first match against Diova though.”

“What about your two prospective opponents?” I asked, “I’m guessing that one of them is particularly good, and one is particularly bad?”

“No actually,” Halea said, “They’re both pretty awful, which I guess means that they’re giving me some credit,” she smirked.

“Why would that-“ I started, “Ah, I see. They know you’re good, and they don’t want you knocking out some prideful nobleman in the first or second round. Wouldn’t look good at all, and the family would be royally pissed off.”

 “Exactly. Which means that I advance to the third round, almost automatically, where I fight…” she trailed off, with an expectant gesture.

“Either Victorina, your clubmate, or Diova, who’s probably a damn powerful battlemage,” I finished, “Worse still, the round after that you’d again be facing either a powerful battlemage in the form of Andrew, or your clubmate, Minki. Yeah, the tournament organizers haven’t been very nice at all.”

“Weevil dicked sons of whores,” Halea confirmed, and Minki covered her mouth, turning bright red.

“Halea!” Victorina chastised.

“Doesn’t mean it’s not true,” Halea said in her defense, and Victorina just sighed again.

“And all the bye does is minimize your time in the arena, and limit the number of people that risk getting beaten by you before you might end up fighting each other,” I supposed.

“It also keeps the spectators from feeling too squeamish I guess,” Victorina said, “Since there’s less of us delicate women getting beaten up in front of everyone.”

“Victorina…” Halea said, hesitantly, but in a serious tone, “Are you sure that you want to stick to the plan? If Diova’s your first match up, you might need that MAC spell. He’s really good, it could make the difference.”

Victorina shook her head, “No, we stick to the plan. You two at least are probably going to make it through your first match without needing to use it, there’s no sense in throwing the plan out for my sake. Besides, I’ve barely had time to practice with it, he might still beat me, and then the cat’s out of the bag. It still works, even more so if I beat Diova without it.”

“Hmm?” Halea inquired.

“If I beat Diova, then the two of us fight…” Victorina started to say.

“Oh,” Halea cut in, “And then we just don’t use the MAC spell at all during our match, which means Andrew will be caught completely off guard when Minki hits him with it.”

“Exactly,” Victorina confirmed, “And if I don’t beat Diova, well then you get to surprise him with it. What about you Minki? Are you still comfortable with the plan?”

Minki nodded, hair flying about, “I can do it,” she promised.

-----

The first thing I noticed, when the first of the matches started, was that the arena stopped being a big featureless plain of hard packed sand as soon as the big starting gong was rung. The roughly hundred metre wide floor of the arena shifted and melded, forming instead into lightly rolling grassy hills, with sparse trees and a river running from one side of the arena to the other.

*Damn, magical danger room for the win.*

The first match was between Halea's two prospective opponents, and was actually somewhat more interesting than I’d expected. According to the others, neither of these two were particularly skilled, but that was a relative measure. Aside from the year end tournament, this was supposed to be the biggest and grandest of all the tournaments, with the biggest and grandest group of spectators. So while these two might not have compared favourably to Halea or Victorina, they were still pretty damn good compared to the rest of the Mages in the university.

“Is this the usual set up for tournaments?” I asked Victorina quietly as I watched the combatants, “The hills and trees and river and stuff?”

“Sort of,” she responded, “It’s one of a few that get seen often, though there are a couple others.”

I nodded, and watched as the two Mages closed in on each other. They’d started about fifty metres from each other, equidistant from the centre, and the first minute or so was a game of cat and mouse as each tried to manoeuvre to get the first shot off on their opponent.

It all came to a head when one of the two Mages, the one in green robes, cast Sound, seemingly on a hunch. His hunch paid off, and his blue robed opponent turned towards the illusory sound of a snapping branch and shouted a spell to life. A fireball streaked from the blue Mage’s hand and towards a clump of bushes at the base of one tree. Spurred on by the shout, the green Mage rushed to the top of the hill that had lain between the two Mages, and found himself to the side and just a bit in front of the blue Mage.

Just as the blue Mage’s Fireball struck home, igniting the shrubbery around the tree, the green Mage threw a Lightning Ball that he had held prepared since the start of the match. The blue Mage was caught totally off guard, and it wasn’t until the ball of lightning struck him in the right shoulder that he seemed to notice.

*How did he not see the big glowy orb of death? Is he throwing the match, or is elf peripheral vision not as good as a human’s?*

The shot didn’t knock the blue Mage out immediately, but it certainly didn’t seem pleasant. The blue Mage lost his footing upon being hit, and the Lightning Ball seemed to have an effect somewhat like a Taser. The effect didn’t last as long as a Taser, perhaps a second or two, but it was enough that the green Mage had already loosed his second strike by the time the blue Mage was back on his feet and scrambling for cover. The spell this time was a Lightning Bolt, and it caught the blue Mage square between the shoulder blades, putting him down for good. The gong rang again, and the green Mage threw up his arms and shouted something unintelligible.

*Note to self, be like Han, shoot first.*

-----

The next match was between Diova and his black robed opponent, with black apparently being a colour favoured by merchants, and not elven emos as I’d initially guessed. The arena did not change with the sounding of the gong, and Diova immediately launched himself skywards. The black robed Mage was looking down at his hands when Diova came to the apex of his huge leap, seemingly distracted by his spell casting. Diova spotted his foe just as he started to fall back towards the ground, and he threw a hand forwards as he cast a spell. Flying through the air as he was, his spell wasn’t particularly accurate, but then it didn’t need to be.

I was expecting one of many possible bolt spells, fired quickly in the hopes of a lucky shot, but his opponent was not so fortunate. Instead there was a stream of sparks, that I confused at first for some sort of Lightning Jet, but which then resolved itself into a swarm of perhaps fifty tiny fiery orbs. Maybe two of the fifty orbs struck the black Mage, just as he finished his spell, with the rest falling around him in a cacophony of tiny explosions, which turned the ground around the Mage into a field of fire.

“Damn, that’s new,” Victorina breathed.

Black robe’s spell hadn’t been in vain however, and a shield materialized around the caster, just as the sparks hit him. He was certainly startled by the sudden impacts, but it seemed not to hurt him, and I saw as he moved that he was covered head to toe in a transparent blue field similar to what Halea had used in our little mud wrestling match.

Diova landed lightly a few feet outside of the field of fire, and swept a hand back and forth, from one edge of the field to another. I thought at first that he was taunting his opponent in some way, but then I saw the reaction of the flames as he swept his arm across. Each little patch of fire pulled away from Diova, but flared with extra vigour. He’d cast Air Jet, and was using it to feed the fires around the enemy Mage.

This seemed to make the black Mage very uncomfortable, and I guessed that the shield worked against various projectiles, but not against the ambient heat of the fire. Diova’s opponent seemed to sway back and forth, as he tried to come to some sort of decision, before finally bolting away from Diova. He ran as quickly as he could, and pulled his legs up high as he ran, trying to avoid the flames.

Diova was apparently not above shooting a man in the back, at least as long as that man wasn’t another noble, and let fly a flurry of Lightning Bolts. They scattered across the back of the fleeing Mage, though the shield absorbed them, and the Mage didn’t even stumble as he ran. Diova didn’t seem particularly bothered by this lack of reaction, and kept up his stream of Lightning Bolts even as his opponent got clear of the flames and turned to fight.

There was a great deal of smoke rising from the well stoked flames, which gave both combatants some degree of concealment. Or at least, it gave Diova a great deal of concealment. His opponent on the other hand had that shield on, which lit him up like a Christmas tree. Without the shield he would have been well camouflaged by his black robes, but with the shield on he was clearly visible through the smoke. Diova kept up his stream of lightning, apparently content to break through his opponent’s shield the hard way, until he saw an answering spark of flame fly at him through the cloud of smoke.

He threw himself hard to one side, and the fire spell flew through the rough area that he’d just occupied. I noticed two things immediately, not only was it not deflected away from Diova as I’d expect if Diova cast a blocking spell, but it also didn’t swerve towards him. The fiery projectile flew absolutely straight and true until it impacted the far wall of the arena in a massive concussion.

I turned away from the explosion and looked back to the acrid black cloud, only to find that I could no longer pick out the black robed Mage. Either he’d been smart enough to drop the shield so he could hide better, or he put enough juice into his fiery answer to Diova’s lightning that just didn’t have the power to sustain the shield any more. Diova seemed to decide that it was the latter of the two, and threw himself through the smoke with the same proto-flying spell that he’d cast initially. He left a trail of curling vapours as he flew through the smoke, and then there was a blinding blue-white flash visible through the black cloud as the ending gong rang.

“Hey Victorina,” I said, in a conversational tone.

“Yes Quinn?”

“You were totally right about it being a good idea for me to get some more experience before I tried competing in any tournaments.”

“I know.”

-----

The third fight was much like the first, though the actors were different, and it only served to reinforce my belief in my initial conclusion that catching your opponent off guard and shooting first seemed to be the best strategy. Shields and such would help a great deal, but as Diova had shown, those could be over powered with sufficient effort and skill. Hit first though? Especially if your opponent doesn’t have a passive defence in place yet, and it would be very difficult for your opponent to make up for his new handicap.

The fourth match was the one I was truly interested in, since it was going to be my first chance to observe Andrew’s preferred strategy. I actually recognized Andrew’s opponent this time, and realized that he’d been one of the people I’d spoken too when I was initially on the search for a club. His name was Brodeu, I’d mentally nicknamed him Bro Dude, and he was the leader of one of the clubs supported by The Order of the Claves.

Both men set off at a run as soon as the starting gong rang, with Andrew making a beeline for his opponent’s starting position, and Brodeu running for what looked like the tallest hill in the arena. Elves it seemed were good sprinters, if not good long distance runners, and he got to the hill before Andrew had even covered half the distance to his target. Brodeu scanned the hills, both hands up, fingers spread, as he looked for Andrew. They saw each other at the same time, as Andrew came pelting up the side of one hill, and they each loosed a quick spell at the other. Brodeu’s was a Lightning Bolt, and Andrew’s answering spell was an Acid Bolt.

Each then cast Deflect hurriedly, trying to finish the spell before their enemy’s shot struck home. Brodeu was quick enough, and the Acid Bolt flew wide. Andrew was not so lucky, and finished too late. The Lightning Bolt deviated slightly, but still struck him in the shoulder, and he hit the ground roughly. I hoped for a split second that this was him defeated, if not with this single spell, then the one to follow.

Brodeu rushed to capitalize on his lucky hit, and threw two more Lightning Bolts, one from each hand, and I could clearly see that these two had been fed quite a bit more mana than the first.

I bared my teeth in a fierce grin, I so desperately wanted this to be the end of Andrew’s run in the tournament, I did not want him facing Minki. Not if he was so fond of acid magic. Well, it wasn’t the end of Andrew’s run. Even with the Hawk Vision amulet worn and active, I couldn’t recognize the spell Andrew cast after falling heavily to the ground, and a second later he disappeared. The two lightning bolts stuck the ground where he’d lain only a moment later, making it clear that it wasn’t a simple illusion that Andrew had cast.

I snapped off the Hawk Vision amulet, relying only on my glasses to locate Andrew, and I found him a few metres away on a different hill, climbing to his feet. Brodeu saw him when he rose, and answered with another Lightning Bolt. And again, Andrew disappeared. This time reappearing just a bit closer, and he broke into a run, though he seemed somewhat dizzy from his brief teleport. Brodeu tried again, and again Andrew was there and gone in a blink, reappearing a few more metres closer to Brodeu.

This cycle repeated itself several times, as Brodeu attempted to land a solid strike on Andrew, and Andrew avoiding the strike with a short range teleport. It certainly threw Andrew off each time he teleported, I could see that in the first few clumsy steps he’d take each time he reappeared, but he managed to keep his balance well enough to stay on his feet and keep running.

Brodeu did his best to try to anticipate where Andrew would teleport to, but it was fairly hopeless, there was too much space to cover and the spells Brodeu had could only hit so large an area. And through it all, Andrew got closer and closer, and Brodeu got more and more nervous.

“How is he managing that?” Halea said, leaning forwards in her seat, “He should be throwing up all over himself after just one casting of that spell.”

It was on Andrew’s final teleport that Brodeu opted for a shield spell, instead of a Lightning Bolt, and he had it up and ready just as Andrew snapped into view. Unfortunately for Brodeu, Andrew snapped into view behind him. There was a brief pause, as both seemed confused by what had just happened, and both scanned around looking for the other. They both realized what had happened at essentially the same time, and both turned as quickly as they could. Brodeu was quick and had his eyes on Andrew in an instant, but his shield was slightly slower in coming around, and a jet of acid shot from Andrew’s outstretched hand to catch Brodeu across the face. His shield came into place a moment later, cutting off the jet for just a moment, before the pain caused Brodeu lose his grip on the spell.

Andrew didn’t let up, casting a second jet in fact, and the force of the two jets combined knocked Brodeu off of his feet. Andrew stalked forwards, keeping the two jets on Brodeu’s writhing form, seeming undisturbed by the sounds that Brodeu was making.

The ending gong sounded, three times in quick succession, and Andrew finally called an end to his game.

*He does think of it as a game, doesn’t he? He’s latched on to the idea of this whole thing as a sort of video game, and doesn’t really see what he’s doing as real. That, or he’s a colossally shitty person.*

I looked over to Minki, after Brodeu was spirited out of the arena by a group of Mages, and opened my mouth to speak.

“I can do it Quinn,” she whispered fiercely, “I can do it.”

I looked at her uncertainly. I had no right to boss her around, the club had been assembled specifically so she could make these decisions for herself, but did not want her to endure what Brodeu had just gone through. I cared for her, a lot. I wasn’t quite certain yet about what form those feelings took, but whether she was my adopted little sister, or someone who I wanted to pin down and strip naked, I did not want her going through what I’d just seen.

“I can do it Quinn,” she said, looking me right in the eye, “I promise.”

I grimaced, but nodded, “Alright.”

*Saves me from needing to plot his violent and bloody death I guess.*

“Good luck Halea,” Victorina said, as Halea stood up.

“Thanks,” she said with a smirk, “But I won’t need it.”

The first round had taken some time to wrap up, and it was nearly noon by the time Halea was heading off for her own match. I’d taken some notes on the matches in the first round, but they were all fairly indistinguishable from each other. The first couple minutes were spent jockeying for position, though sometimes one of the Mages would pull the same trick that Diova had, while each tried to catch the other unawares. There was some clever trickery with illusions or sound, and then whoever was caught unawares would get pounded into the dirt by a flurry of Fireballs or Lighting Bolts. There were a couple mix-ups, as Mages ran into each other at the same time, or managed not to get taken out by their opponent’s surprise attack, but then neither of those had happened more than twice in two dozen matches.

“Is this usually how things go?” I asked of Victorina, “With the long game of cat and mouse and then a short and brutal surprise attack?”

“In the first round, yes. It’s the second round when the real fight starts. The combatants are more evenly matched, and the more skilled Mage doesn’t need to waste their time trying to track down and find their opponent. Unless one of the two specializes in the more deceptive schools of magic, the two usually come to a head almost immediately. This is also when most Mages will show off whatever they’ve been keeping up their sleeve.”

“Like our MAC spell?” I asked.

“Exactly. Some of the more confident contestants will keep things back until the third round, just like we are, but for most of the contestants getting to the third round is not a foregone conclusion.”

“What about Diova then? Was that just a bit of showboating? Or do you think he’s got a second trick to pull for this round?”

She frowned in thought, “That’s certainly possible. Personally I would have put it down to arrogance, but you might be right. I’ll need to watch for that. You might still be giving him too much credit though. Diova’s father is here for the ball, and is almost certainly in the audience somewhere with a substantial portion of his court. He might just want to put on a good show, as the prospective heir.”

“Maybe,” I hedged, “Just be careful Victorina.”

-----

I’d seen just a tiny bit of what Halea could do when practicing with her, but actually watching her fight for real was something else entirely. The green robed Mage seemed content to follow the same strategy that he had in the first round, and set off at a run, hunched low to the ground, and I guessed that he was trying to circle around the edge of the arena in some attempt to flank Halea. Halea did not cooperate with this plan, not at all. She favoured the same highly mobile strategy as Diova, though with one key difference. Diova’s spell had taken him into the air in a high arc, to give him a better view of the battlefield. Instead she launched herself in a much flatter trajectory, to the top of the nearest hill, and then from hilltop to hilltop at great speed until she reached the green Mage’s starting position.

She stopped, almost exactly where he’d started from, and cast a look around. In the time that Halea had crossed all of the intervening distance the green Mage had only just barely made it to cover, and he froze as he saw her streaking in. She didn’t seem to spot him, and he cast a pair of Fireballs in quick succession, holding one in each hand. He waited until her searching took her gaze away from him, and then launched both to streak towards her back.

Well it seemed that Halea had been waiting for him to do that, and used her Dash spell to launch herself directly backwards, and towards Mr. Green. She twisted as she flew through the air, and a ten foot jet of orange flame sprouted by one hand just as she skidded to a stop in front of her opponent. She’d passed directly between the two Fireballs, which couldn’t have been more than a foot apart, and the two had turned in slightly towards her just as she passed them. She’d been moving too fast for them to catch her though, and they crossed behind her, before flying off aimlessly. She brought the hand with the Fire Jet up and across the green Mage’s hiding place, and the fire tore through the sparse cover to strike her shocked foe.

The sudden searing pain seemed to snap him out of it, but by then he was pretty much done. He tried to cast some sort of defensive spell, but couldn’t hold his concentration through the pain, and a moment later made some sort of gesture with his hands. Halea had been about to sweep the jet across him again, but caught herself, and stepped back while turning off the spell. The ending gong rang a moment later.

I turned to give Victorina a look, “I thought there were supposed to be proper fights in the second round?”

“Oh hush,” she said, “That was Halea, she doesn’t count. Besides, he was set up to lose, not that his parents are likely to see it that way. They’re certainly not going to be happy.”

“Because he yielded?” I asked.

She nodded, “Yes, and to a woman no less. I imagine that there will be a great deal of pressure on Diova to beat her, assuming he can defeat me first.”

“Why Diova?” I asked, furrowing my brows, “The green guy’s not a noble, at least, he’s not wearing any noble colours, and certainly not indigo.”

“Ah, but he is noble,” She said, “That was Tosa, he’s the bastard of one of the Tanaka family’s vassals.”

“Hmm, well that certainly makes things more interesting. Do you think whoever stacked the deck against our club intentionally put us up against people involved with the Tanakas?”

“Yes. Yes I do,” she said, before rising, “I’ve got to get ready for my match though. I’ll see you afterwards.”

-----

Halea fell into the seat beside me some time later, stretching languidly, “So unsatisfying,” she said through a groan.

“Oh?” I asked, amused.

“I went to so much trouble to get myself ready for the man, I got all worked up and excited, and then the poor boy can barely endure a minute of my attention,” she sighed, “And just as I’m getting into it, he finished prematurely. What’s a girl to do?”

“You’re as bad as Thera,” I laughed.

“Please,” she said, taken aback, “I’m **much** worse, Thera might have her little Verridisiac potion that she and Abis drink by the gallon whenever they’re together, but I’ve got enough erotic spells to fill a small library.”

She looked at me out of the corner of one eye, smirking, “Maybe you and I can do some magical research some time.”

I was particularly conscious of Minki sitting next to me, as I did my best to avoid rising to Halea’s comment.

-----

I was expecting a graceful, possibly even Wuxiaesque, fight between two Mages as skilled as Victorina and Diova. That is not what happened.

Diova opened the match with the same high flying leap as before, and again he launched a massive cloud of tiny sparks to land around his opponent, who in this case, was Victorina. In some ways Victorina mirrored the strategy of Diova’s first opponent, as she spent her first moments by casting some defensive spells. She finished much more quickly though, and already had her defences in place as the sparks started to rain down towards her. Her next spell, just as the sparks landed about her, was a Water Jet. She spun in a quick circle, soaking the ground around her. It didn’t stop the series of tiny explosions as the sparks landed, but it did prevent the sparks from catching the grass on fire.

Diova landed just after the sparks did, slightly outside of Victorina’s pool, and threw a Lightning Bolt. The bolt struck Victorina’s shield, and a spider web of bright blue lines shot out from around Victorina’s feet.

Halea inhaled sharply, and I cocked an eyebrow at her.

“The water might have been a mistake,” she said, and Victorina ignored Diova’s second bolt, and focused on a different spell, “It keeps down the fire, but that’s not nearly as big a problem as those Lighting Bolts will be if she loses her shield.”

Diova didn’t bother trying to hammer his way through Victorina’s shield, like he had with his previous opponent, and instead took advantage of Victorina’s distractedness to cast a full body shield of his own. Victorina finished hers just slightly ahead of Diova, and followed it up immediately with a Fire Bolt of her own. Diova’s shield snapped into place an instant before the bolt struck him, but this was a relatively small consolation. I’d been wondering what Victorina had been taking so long to cast, after all, she’d had the shield up already, what else could she be going for?

Water Elementals, that’s what.

Or at least, they looked like Water Elementals. There were two huge humanoid shapes, eight or so feet tall, and four feet wide, and both were comprised entirely of water. They surged towards Diova, and Victorina cast a pair of Water Jets. Diova retreated back slowly from the two hulking shapes, hands flying in a new spell. The Water Elementals seemed unable to move outside of the pool of water Victorina had created, but she prepared the ground for them with her pair of Water Jets.

Diova had caught on it seemed, and his completed spell turned out to be the same one that had launched him skywards initially. He didn’t get very far. The Water Elementals couldn’t **walk** outside of the pool, but their arms could reach outside of it just fine. Diova launched himself up and back, but one of the Water Elemental’s arms shot out, changing from a short tree trunk like protrusion, and into a wrist thick tendril of water fifty feet long.

It caught Diova by the ankle, and swung him back to the ground in a wide arc. The Elemental smashed him into the ground, hard enough that I thought I felt **my** teeth rattle, in the very centre of Victorina’s circle of water. The two Elementals surged from their position at the edge of the pool, and caught the still stunned Diova on the ground. Victorina wasn’t pulling her punches, and neither were her Elementals. The two of them pounded relentlessly on Diova’s shield, and I could see that the force of their blows was actually pushing Diova into the soft ground. He tried to lift his arms to cast a spell, but the Elementals hammered that arm back down.

Victorina cut off the Water Jets, and stood back some distance, while the Elementals tried to break down Diova’s shield. It was hard to hear over all of the splashing, but I thought I heard Diova start to chant something as the Elements continued their relentless pounding.

“Is the shield providing air as well?” I asked Halea, “The Elementals have pushed him well below the surface of that pool.”

“He’ll have whatever air was trapped inside of the shield when he switched to being impermeable to liquids. Not a lot, but it will be enough for a minute or two,” she replied, leaning forwards, “I’m just trying to figure out what that spell is he’s casting.”

Victorina noticed it first, when her next breath fogged the air. I caught on a moment later, as ice crystals started to form in the pool around him. Then it became a race, to see who would run out of energy first. Diova, who had to sustain both the shield, and his frost spell, or Victorina. Who had to provide the energy to keep the two Elementals together.

I had no idea what any of those spells might cost in energy, but I imagined that none of them could be cheap. Such a large scale temperature change was likely to be taxing, but then how could you even quantify the energy cost of creating even just one Elemental?

Diova seemed to be winning out though, and as he chanted the ice crystals grew and knit together around him. The ice even served to protect him, as the Elementals now had a second barrier between them and their target. They were getting sluggish though, the spreading ice seeming to sap their strength and speed. In an instant the ice around their feet was frozen, and the two Elementals found themselves locked in place, with ice spreading up towards their knees as they too started to freeze. Victorina was also caught in the ice, with the water around her feet freezing, trapping her in place.

The Elementals managed a few final strikes before they finally froze solid, but that quickly proved counterproductive. It hadn’t been enough to finally penetrate Diova’s shield, but it had been enough to ensure that the ice covering him was mostly shattered.

He sat up, pushing shards and sheets of ice off of himself, but seemed unable to stand since his legs were still trapped under the ice. His shield faltered a moment later, almost in the same instant as Victorina’s, and the two found themselves maybe ten feet from each other, almost completely immobilized, and probably without a drop of mana.

There was a beat, as they both took stock of their limited options, and then they set to it with a fervour. Both of them double-fisting Fire Bolts, of the weak sort that they could each cast without needing to tap their now empty mana reserves. Both of them kept up the stream of fire admirably, and both seemed able to concentrate on their spells despite the pain of the constant concussive blasts. In real terms the exchange was probably shorter than it felt to watch, or to take part in. Watching it, I was sure that they’d each hit the other at least fifty times, and they probably felt like they’d each taken a couple hundred magical punches in the face, but it couldn’t have been more than half a dozen in reality.

Victorina was the first to fall. Diova’s position had been awkward, but it had lent him some degree of protection, since Victorina had a smaller target to shoot at. The limited guidance that all projectile spells had didn’t help either, since from what I’d seen during the first round, the Mage needed to see their target for it to work. And after the first or so strike, both of them were firing blindly as they each had small explosions going off in their faces and throwing off their aim.

She crumpled forwards awkwardly, feet still trapped in the ice, and the gong rang to signal the end of the match.

*Shit.*

# Chapter 42

**Quinn**

-----

It wasn’t until the start of the next match, Andrew’s next match, that I realized Victorina hadn’t yet returned. I looked over to Halea, and raised an eyebrow.

“She’ll be fine,” Halea assured me, “She’s probably just getting something to eat.”

I shrugged, and looked back to the arena, “Alright.”

It was about a minute later, as Andrew and his opponent took their positions, that Halea finally stood.

“You know what, I’ll go check on her,” Halea said, “Now don’t you two get up to any trouble while I’m gone.”

I rolled my eyes, “Don’t want to feel left out?”

“Mmm… Maybe,” she said, as she left.

My gaze might have lingered slightly on Halea as she left, her hourglass figure and swaying hips tended to draw the eye, and I certainly found her nice to look at. I caught myself a moment later, and glanced at Minki to see how badly I’d erred. I had not erred, as it turned out, or at least, Minki hadn’t noticed my error. Her attention was taken up entirely by the preparations going on in the arena, and she seemed to be busy freaking out. She had her arms wrapped around herself tightly, and she seemed to be trying to push herself through the back of her chair.

I leaned over slightly, putting my head next to hers, “Hey,” I said, “It’s going to be alright. You’ll do fine.”

“No I won't!” Minki squealed, “How am I supposed to make any use of the MAC spell if he just teleports out of the way? You saw what happened to Brodeu, and he’s way better at battlemagic than I am.”

“Whoa,” I said gently, “Take a deep breath, relax a little, and consider this. Andrew uses acid for a reason, and not just because he likes the idea of humiliating his opponents in front of everyone. That’s part of the reason he does it, I grant you that, but it’s not the only reason.”

“It also makes it almost impossible to concentrate on any spells,” Minki said, “I know that much Quinn.”

“It’s not just that either, it’s also the psychological effect that using acid has,” I said, as the starting gong rang in the arena, I ignored it and continued, “He’s only fought the one match so far, but in effect he managed to attack every potential opponent that he might face today, during his fight with Brodeu. Even Brodeu himself was flustered, before Andrew even managed to get him with a drop of acid, because Brodeu had probably seen or heard of other matches Andrew took part in.”

“But Quinn,” Minki said, “The acid is still-“

“Hold on,” I said, interrupting her as gently as possible, “It’s not about Andrew’s acid spell, or even his teleportation magic, not really. What he’s doing is trying to unnerve his opponent enough for them to make a mistake. Now he’s using the combination of the acid and the rapid movement to do this, I can certainly see how it would scare the hell out of someone to see him teleporting rapidly towards them, as they dread the effect that the acid will have once he gets close enough. But if you want to counter his strategy, you don’t focus on the spells, you focus on why he’s using those spells.”

“And he’s doing it to scare his opponent,” she said, nodding, “But then what do I do, just try not to be scared? That might work for you Quinn, but I don’t know if I can do that.”

“Well, hmm, how do I best explain this…” I said, taking a moment to think, “Well your father is a Duke isn’t he, and he’s got some soldiers of his own? Maybe you’ve even seen them drilling.”

“Yes,” Minki said, though she seemed a little confused as to where I was going with this, “Sometimes I watched as they were marching around and such.”

“Well soldiers train so that they know what to do at any given time. A battlefield is terrifying, it’s loud, people and horses are screaming, and depending on how well things are going, people might be dying left and right. Training helps demystify all of that, knowledge is the best antidote to fear, and training grants that knowledge.”

“But Quinn,” Minki said intensely, “I don’t have any training, not really, and I can’t get it in the next fifteen minutes either!”

“You might not have training, but then, neither does anyone else. Most Mages have practiced their own spells, and have probably prepared for some common strategies that they might face, but they haven’t trained for every spell that they might face. Especially since new spells are being created all the time, it’s just not feasible, especially when we’ve all got studies to consider on top of that. This means that it’s fairly easy for a Mage to get a little flustered in combat, and to make the wrong decision, even if that Mage is quite clever otherwise. They might come up with **a** solution, but it might not be the **best** solution.”

“Like Victorina fighting Diova just now,” Minki said, nodding.

“Exactly, it wasn’t even that bad a strategy. But she got too focused on it, and when it started to look like the wrong choice she didn’t switch things up. She got tunnel vision, she had what she thought was a decent solution, and when it didn’t work she didn’t try a different one, she just tried the same thing but with more effort behind it. It happened to Brodeu as well, do you know what I mean by that?” I asked.

She frown in thought, and then spoke, “He kept trying to shoot Andrew just as he was reappearing. He was anticipating where Andrew was going to pop up, and was firing **before** Andrew even finished casting the teleport spell.”

“Exactly, when if he’d just waited a second he would have had no trouble hitting Andrew. Andrew might not have even been able to defend himself, because he’d still be shaking off the dizziness of just having teleported. But he didn’t wait until Andrew reappeared, and he didn’t take advantage of the dizziness, he was too flustered. And that’s Andrew’s strategy, his strategy isn’t acid or teleportation, those are just the tools he’s using to accomplish it. His strategy is to scare the hell out of his opponent so that they make mistakes, they seize on the first counter-strategy that they can think of, and they’re too flustered to reassess once it’s clear that it’s not the best solution. He’s amplifying the normal effect that combat has on people, especially untrained or less trained people. Brodeu didn’t want Andrew getting any closer, and in effect he was rushing to shoot him, when the best thing to do would have been to slow down, just a little bit. Instead Brodeu shot too soon, and at the wrong target. So by the time Brodeu had the next Fireball ready to go, Andrew had already recovered and gotten most of the way through casting his teleportation spell. So Minki, what are you going to do?”

She looked out over the arena, where Andrew had already closed with his opponent and was liberally spraying him with acid, this time from a pair of Acid Jets, “I’m going to wait until he teleports for the first time, and then shoot him in his big ugly face.”

“Oh, you can do even better than that,” I said, grinning evilly, “Here’s what I’ve got in mind…”

-----

**Andrew**

-----
-----

I pumped one fist in the air as the ending gong rang, while Sinabu kept screaming like a bitch at my feet. And it was all me, I’d done this. I’d been the one to take Acid Jet from something that most Mages thought was a gimmick, and turn it into one of the strongest spells that the arena had ever seen. And I’d been the one to turn Teleport into the best defensive spell anyone had heard of. Why bother blocking or deflecting an attack, when you could just be somewhere else? I never had to worry if an attack was too powerful for me to slow down or stop, when I was a good ten yards away when it went off. Quinn had always given me shit for not being a giant nerd like he was, a ‘dumb jock’ he’d said. Well he hadn’t done what I’d done, he hadn’t come up with as killer combo as I had. He’d refused to even face me in the arena.

I bet what I had achieved had even pissed him off. I remembered when we’d try to play games online with him, or when the whole family would all get together and either we’d go downstairs to game, or we’d play board games with our parents. The game never mattered, and it didn’t matter if it was PC, PlayStation, or table top. Quinn always had to win. The rest of us all just wanted to have some fun dammit, but he’d do his tryhard bullshit. If he heard that Mom was bringing some new board game over, he’d spend a whole day before researching and looking up strategies like some sort of grognard. If we were going to play Civ, well then he’d do the same thing. He’d spend more time watching videos and reading wiki’s than actually playing the game. And when it did come time to play, it wasn’t even fun. He’d end up owning half the map, and would lord it over the rest of us like a dick.

Dad always said that we should be patient with Quinn though. Dad said that Quinn was only like that because he wasn’t really good at anything else, and didn’t have really any friends, so he stayed inside and played videogames all day. Quinn liked to act like he was smarter than us, but really all he’d done is practice more, while the rest of us were busy doing real life stuff. Dad said that maybe joining the military would make Quinn more normal, but I guess that didn't really work out.

*Well guess what Quinn? Now I’ve got it all. I’m stronger, more athletic, better looking, and I figured out magic stuff that you can’t even wrap your head around. You’re ‘smart’? Sure, sure Quinn. Pretty sure magic is about being smart, and the University even* ***knows*** *that I’m better at magic than you. Hell, I’ve even got my pick of any of the girls from the League, do you? No you damn well don’t, you’re too busy being Victorina’s bitch. Well guess what? My club leader kicked your club leader’s ass. And to top it all off, I’m Dad’s heir. One day I’d be Lord Andrew Walsh, Count of Leucia.*

I didn’t know how Quinn bullshited his way into some purple robes, but I was going to find out, and then I’d **really** be the one on top. Hell, once I did that he’d be out on his ass. No magic for you if you’re too poor because Dad took your bursary away.

-----

“Well done,” Diova said, as I sat down next to him.

“Thanks man,” I said.

He raised an eyebrow, and I waved one hand, “Whatever, thanks **Prince**.”

“You’re quite welcome.”

“So, you think you can kick Halea’s ass?” I asked him.

“Of course,” he said, giving Tosa a look, “I’m not so easily duped.”

Tosa didn’t say anything, which was good, because I was pretty sure that he was only kept around because Diova’s dad owed a favour to Tosa’s dad. And then the loser had gone and lost to Halea.

“What about yourself?” Diova asked, “Do you think you can defeat the Kipazi girl?”

“What, the tiny grey haired chick that follows Quinn around?” I laughed, “Yeah, but then I’m not going to fight her, am I? I’m going to fight whoever’s standing there in the arena with her, about to kick her ass.”

“I would not be so certain,” Diova said, “Quinn refused your challenge, however I expect that he still wishes to see you beaten. Three of his clubmates have entered the tournament. I expect that if he had time to create any spells using his Outsider knowledge, it’s likely that he shared such spells with his clubmates in the hopes that one of the three would find themselves facing you. I imagine that he views them as a proxy, through which he might bring about your defeat. If Quinn has prepared something for the girls, I would expect to see it shortly,” he finished, nodding towards the arena.

“What, still mad I won’t share my new Acid Jet? And what makes you think Quinn would share? Sure, he was always the one who came up with the wombo combos back on Earth, but he’s not as good at magic as I am-“

“He’s not as **talented** as you are,” Diova cut in.

“Whatever, same thing,” I said, “Point is, even if he did come up with something, he’d keep it to himself so he could use it against me on his own, whenever he grows a pair and decides to fight me. And if he did share, wouldn’t Victorina have used it against you?”

“Perhaps, though in Victorina’s case the Water Elementals may very well have been due to a pearl of wisdom from Quinn.”

“What?” I asked, “No way, Quinn didn’t invent the Water Elemental spell. Hell, I learned it before he even showed up here.”

“True enough,” Diova said, “However, that’s the first case I’ve seen where anyone has been able to sustain multiple such Elementals without the use of a specialized focus, or a great deal of additional energy expenditure. It’s possible that Quinn refined the spell in some way, or showed Victorina’s enchanter a way to create the Elemental focus in a much smaller form.”

“Well then I’ll just watch out for the Elementals, I can teleport around them too, no biggie.”

“Well,” Diova said, ”We shall see,” and the starting gong rang.

-----

I didn’t know what the guy’s name was, but whoever he was, he seemed to want to get this fight over and done with quick. He cast Wind Walk, which let him glide across up, over, and down the hills towards the tiny flat chested girl that Quinn seemed to have settled for.

*Maybe if you were a real man, and not whipped by Victorina, you’d be able to find a girlfriend that didn’t look like a preteen boy.*

Well the preteen boy started the match by backing up, until she was at the top of the hill that she’d started in front of. And then she just stood there, looking more awkward than Quinn normally did, if that was even possible. The soon to be winner cast a couple of Lighting Balls as he slid across the ground, one in each hand. He wasn’t messing around, and both of them looked like they’d had a huge amount of power put into them. Quinn’s pet cast sort of defensive magic on herself while she waited for the winner to come blast her to pieces, though I didn’t see any obvious glowy shield once she finished. Then she prepped a pair of Lighting Balls of her own, hers were much smaller than the other guy’s though. *Heh.*

The guy slid to a stop once he spotted Quinn’s toy, and he didn’t waste any time. The girl looked shocked, as the two massive Lighting Balls came streaking towards her, and then she shouted something **awfully** familiar, and disappeared.

The bitch **reappeared** behind her opponent. That was the incantation that **I’d** created, she was using **my** teleportation spell! Both orbs of lighting passed through the space she’d just left, and then she threw one of her own at the man’s back. The guy was pretty lucky, she’d been frightened, or dizzy from the spell, and the shot went wide. It certainly got his attention though, and he spun around to see her standing there with a terrified expression on her face. He cast Lighting Bolt as quickly as he could, but he was barely halfway through by the time she disappeared again.

She reappeared in the same spot she’d left the first time, arm already extended, and she let her Lightning Ball fly. The fucking thing smacked the guy right in the back of the head, and the gong rang a second later.

“That motherfucker,” I breathed, “That son of a bitch, that’s my spell, that’s even the same incantation. That bastard copied me!”

“It is possible that it was an illusion,” Diova said, and that same stupid even tone he always used.

“Where’s Quinn sitting,” I said, scanning the arena, “Where is the prick?”

“Just there,” Diova said, nodding off to one side, “Just next to the gate the girl entered through.”

He was looking right at me, the smug prick. Stupid grin on his face and everything.

“Do you see him over there?” I asked, pointing at Quinn, “This is **exactly** the sort of thing he’d do. He’s not happy unless he gets to show everyone else how much better he is than everyone else.”

“Hmm,” Diova said, “Perhaps he has in fact duplicated your work. And it seems he’s sorted out the initial disorientation you still seem to suffer from upon teleporting. He’s even extended the range it seems, that was at least double what your version of the spell can do.”

“Well I’m gonna melt his little pet when I face her, and then I’m going to kick his ass right out of the University. I told you about how he’s not an Emperor, right? Well I’m gonna prove it.”

“There is the matter of how,” Diova said. “If he’s managed to convince one of the University’s notaries, under the compulsion of a truth spell, then I don’t see it being possible. There’s also the possibility that he’s telling the truth, even if what you told me about his family is true, he may still be related closely enough to the right people for it not to matter in the eyes of the University.”

“We’ll see about that,” I said, “We will see.”

-----

I took off to go get something to eat while I waited for the next round to start, and by the time I got back Diova’s match was just about to start. Fighting him was gonna be hard, especially since he jumped around a lot, but I was pretty sure I could do it. His jump spell took even longer to cast than Blink, so I might be able to get up beside him just as he lands, and then smack him with an Acid Jet. I’d want a shield up before I did that though, I still hadn’t worked out the dizziness after teleporting, and I didn’t want him to get me while I was still disoriented.

“Do you really think you can beat him Andy?” Tosa asked, “I don’t think he’s going to let you get close enough. You might have to fight the normal way, and we all know how you are with projectile spells.”

“Whatever Tosa, you're good with projectiles, good for you. I'm good with jets,” I said, kinda tired of his constant bragging about this. He **had** lost his match after all, and it was to someone using a jet spell. “Just watch the stupid fight.”

The starting gong rang, and Diova did what he always did. He leapt into the air, and soared over the arena. Halea meanwhile took a handful of something from one pocket, and as she waited I saw bits of whatever it was slip between her fingers and fall to the ground.

Then she saw Diova coming in, he cast his Mini Meteors spell, and a spray of tiny embers flew from his hands to fall towards Halea. Halea finished her own spell a moment later, and raised one arm. She opened the hand and there was a sound like a dozen thunderclaps, all on top of each other. Whatever Halea threw moved to fast to see, but I saw what it did to Diova. In one instant he was flying through the air, robes flapping, like something out of the Matrix. In the next, he was a bloody ruin. He landed on the ground with a wet smack, and was very still.

A hush went around the arena, and it took the guy on the gong a moment to realize what the hell had just happened. But eventually the gong rang, and just like that, Diova had lost.

I looked behind me, to where King Tanaka and his court were sitting. The courtiers were speaking to each other in hushed whispers, but King Tanaka just sat silently, and he seemed kinda mad. Diova had lost in the arena before, but not to a girl, and not like this.

*Man, now I’ve got to deal with that spell too. Well I just hope that Quinn’s pissed off Tanaka as part of the deal.*

-----

I hunkered down as soon as the starting gong rang, and stuck to the low lying areas of the arena as I advanced. If I saw it coming I could Blink out of the way, or even cast Deflect, but as surprise attacks went that shotgun spell was pretty deadly. I thought about casting a shield spell to guard against that sort of thing, but it was too expensive since I needed to conserve my energy for Blink. I made for the other starting position, but in a wide circle instead of a straight line. I prepped a couple of Acid Balls as I tried to get a flank on the girl, even hitting her with one of them might be enough to stop her from casting long enough for me to get in close. Oh man, Quinn was going to be pissed right the fuck off once I was done with his little toy.

I got down on my belly as I got near to the top of a hill close to the girls starting position, and crawled the rest of the way up, just peeking my head and one hand over. I scanned the low lying areas around me, but didn’t spot her. It wasn’t until I checked the other hilltops that I saw her, lying on a hill of her own, near my own start position. She was doing the same thing I’d just been doing, peering down into the small valley where I’d started, hand at the ready to deliver a surprise attack.

*Well isn’t that just perfect.*

I twisted just enough to point my hand at her, I didn’t want to move too much and have her spot me, and took a second to aim carefully. It was almost a hundred yards to her position, and I didn’t want to miss my one free shot. I let the Acid Ball fly a moment later, and watched as it flew towards her. I wanted to get up and start running as soon as I’d fired it, but if I broke line of sight the orb wouldn’t be able to home in on it’s target, and I was counting on that to make up for any error in my aim.

I was glad that I did take the time to watch. The orb smacked into her side, just below her right arm, and acid splashed down her side, over her back, and some pooled underneath her to burn her chest. She screamed, and tried to jump away from where the acid had hit her. It didn’t really work, and only made her look foolish as she slipped and went tumbling down the hill. I stood and broke into a run as soon as she tumbled out of sight, I had to catch her while the acid was still doing its work. It would stick around for a little while, but that didn’t mean that I had time to waste. ‘

It was easy to find her, even if all the hills looked the same, I just had to follow the whimpers and muted screams. I came up on her while she was still thrashing around, trying to rub the acid off onto the ground. The acid had hit her pretty hard, I had after all put a lot of power into the Acid Ball, and one side of her chest was bared where the acid had eaten her robes.

*She really does look like a boy.*

I smirked, and lifted a hand. It was just as I started casting Acid Jet, that the world went black.

# Chapter 43

Quinn

-----

*Holy fuck Minki. That was hardcore.*

Of course, as soon as Minki blew the top of Andrew’s head off with the MAC spell, she yelped and covered her face, which rather ruined the effect. The ending gong rang, and she beat a path back to the gate she’d entered from. She did her best to keep her chin up as she left, but it was hard for her to put on a strong face while she was still trying to keep herself covered where the acid had burned a bit of her clothes away. The burns on her skin hadn’t healed yet either, and wouldn’t until she left the arena, but she was keeping it together despite the pain.

“Quinn,” Victorina said, though her tone made it sound like a question.

I looked at her questioningly.

“Quinn…” Halea said from my other side, exasperated but amused.

“From context I’m guessing that there’s something I should be doing, that I’m not doing?” I asked, looking from one of them to the other.

Victorina sighed, and Halea laughed.

“Yes, you big lumbering oaf,” Victorina said, clearly exasperated, “Go check on her Quinn.”

“Oh,” I said, and stood up abruptly, “Alright. I’ll be back.”

I hurried to, and then down, the steps that led into one of the tunnels that allowed contestants or workers to enter the arena. Minki had already made it to the tunnel by the time I got there, and I was directed to one of the rooms that were set aside for people to recover in. I pushed open the door, to find Minki standing there stripped to the waist, though facing away from me. Her hair fell around her face as she bowed her head to examine her ruined robes, and stray grey strands just tickled her milky white shoulders. It was some sort of luck, whether it good or bad was hard to tell, that she’d opted for trousers today. She normally wore ankle length robes that were essentially a dress, and if she’d not opted for something more practical for the arena, I might have seen quite a bit more.

She turned at the sound of the door swinging shut behind me, and then yelped and crossed her arms across her chest, “Quinn!”

“Uh, sorry, sorry,” I said, reaching behind me for the doorknob, “I’ll be going now.”

“No, it’s,” she hesitated, “Its fine,” she said, though she did turn a little pink.

“For the record,” I said seriously, “This is Victorina’s fault. She told me to do this.”

“She told you to barge in here while I was half naked?” She asked, and she managed to make it sound honest, rather than sarcastic.

“Uhh… yes. Yes she did.”

“Well,” she said awkwardly, “I beat Andrew, are you… happy?”

“Yeah, though I noticed you were a little personal with your finishing blow,” I said wryly.

She nodded vigorously, and clasped her hands under her chin, covering herself instead with her slim forearms, “It was awful Quinn, I don’t know why Halea likes it so much. When I hit the first one with the Lighting Bolt in the first match he just fell over, but when I shot Andrew… There was blood and bits of stuff everywhere, and I got some of it on me. I don’t think I’m really cut out for this. Um, I know you worked really hard on the MAC spell with me, but I don’t think I want to do this anymore. I think I’m just going to enter a no contest against Halea. I just hope you’re not disappointed.”

I huffed out an amused breath, “I’m not disappointed Minki, you did really well. I was really worried when he hit you with the Acid Ball, but you pushed on through it, and then you made the best of it by duping him with that illusion. If you had anything to prove, well I think you proved it. And I don’t blame you for not wanting to fight Halea, I certainly wouldn’t want to do it either.”

“Thank you Quinn, I’m glad you’re pleased,” she said, and there was something expectant in her expression, like she was waiting for me to say or do something.

I found myself not knowing what to say next, and I realized then what was making me so reluctant. She reminded me rather uncomfortably of Sila. They had more or less the same figure, both were very slim and lacked any noticeable curves. I remember feeling more unnerved than anything else when I got the first good look at Sila when she tried to climb into bed with me. Sila had looked too much like a child to me, barely five feet tall and so slim, and Minki was even a full six inches shorter than Sila had been. She was a hell of a lot more educated than Sila, and didn’t have the same feeling of emotional immaturity that Sila had, but dammit, it still weirded me out.

*Dammit Quinn, you are your own worst enemy. She’s one of the smartest people you know, you genuinely like her, she’s as cute as a button, she shares your interests, and at the same intense level as you. She even seems ready to reciprocate any feelings you might have for her. You spent the first twenty years of your life being absolutely awful with women, and now you’re being picky? Would you be so reluctant if she had a body like Halea’s?*

It was distinctly possible that I was a giant asshole, and a massive idiot, but I was getting too many of the same vibes as I had with Sila. Minki was definitely one of the best people I’d met since arriving in Nimre, or even Elardia, and I *really* enjoyed spending time with her, but I didn’t think that any of that time was going to be spent naked. Which meant…

“You know what, I’m just going to wait outside while you get dressed. Can you fix that on your own?” I asked, “Or do you want me to find something for you.”

“No, I can fix it,” she said, and while she sounded a little disappointed, she didn’t seem absolutely crushed.

“Alright, I’ll just be outside,” I said, as I opened the door just enough to slip out.

Once I’d left the room I leaned back against the wall next to the door, and let out a breath.

*Minki might possibly be your best friend… isn’t that a strange thought, and you’d better not fuck it up. Not like you did with Sila, not really sure how you messed up with Sila, but whatever you did, don’t do it again.*

Minki opened the door a short time later, and peered up at me, “Thanks for coming to check on me,” she said, “I was a little rattled after the fight, and a big ogre forcing his way into the room while I was changing really helped snap me out of it, thanks,” she teased.

I raised an eyebrow as we ascended the steps back to the others, “Horribly murder one guy and suddenly you’re full of jokes, have you been spending a lot of time with Halea?”

“It’s not Halea I’ve been spending time with,” she said seriously, ”It’s you, and you’ve made me feel a lot more confident. You’ve been a really good role model for me, you seem to feel as nervous and awkward around people as I am, but you don’t let it keep you down. You’re like… a big brother,” she finished, somewhat reluctantly.

*Brother… Yeah, I think that probably works best.*

I reached over and ruffled her hair, and she did her best to slap my arm away.

“Stop it!” she giggled.

“Why?” I asked, “It’s not like it’s going to get any messier.”

“Hey!”

-----

We sat back down with the other two, and Minki told Halea of her plans to enter a no-contest for the coming match.

“Well, I guess that’s me in the semi-finals then,” Halea said, “Let’s see if the spell you two made will get me the rest of the way.”

“It’s a shame that the arena’s set up like this for the debut of the spell, weren’t you able to hit elf sized targets out to nearly three hundred yards?” Victorina asked, “I imagine it would be even easier if there weren’t all these hills in the way.”

“Yeah, and Quinn sized targets out to five hundred,” Halea laughed.

I rolled my eyes, “The range of the spell is really only limited at this point by the sighting and aiming systems we’ve got. By which I mean the hand and the eye. The two mana version of the spell is roughly equivalent to a weapon from Earth with a maximum range of as much as two miles, but that’s with precision engineering and precision optics helping things along,” I explained.

“Is it one of those ‘rifles’ that can do that?” Victorina asked, “Are all human weapons able to reach out to such long ranges?”

“Well, it rather depends on what the weapon in question is meant for,” I hedged, *how the hell would I explain an intercontinental ballistic missile?* “But for a weapon meant to be carried by one man, to shoot another, no. Shots like that are only possible by the best snipers in the world using specialized weapons. More reasonable ranges are about the three to five hundred metres that we’re getting out of the MAC spell.”

“So that’s what your uncle’s weapons are capable of, hmm… that is interesting.” Victorina considered.

“No actually,” I said, “What Uncle Walsh has introduced is the matchlock, which is about as unsophisticated as you can possibly get when it comes to firearms. There are cruder and even less advanced options, but at that point they’d barely be recognizable as a firearm to someone from modern Earth. They’re inaccurate enough that unless the enemy is at fairly close range, you’re wasting your time by aiming at individual people. The matchlocks that my Uncle have introduced are meant to be used in ranks, and fired at another group of men in ranks. Even then a hit isn’t guaranteed.”

“Well then,” Halea said wryly, “Think you can do better?”

“Please,” I smiled, “Don’t insult me. Of course I can. Hell, now there’s a way for the club to make some money, we need to get into the weapons manufacturing business.”

“Just don’t go exhausting yourself working on the project,” Victorina said, “But I can certainly see how we’d be able to benefit greatly from such weapons, even only as a provider to others.”

“You don’t need to worry Victorina, it’s something that’s been on my mind since arriving here, but not something I think I can start just yet. There’s some spells that I think might help things along, so I’ll want to grab those first, and there’s some tools that I might need to build from scratch. Once I do start though, I’ll probably be borrowing Thera to help me. Gunpowder isn’t an alchemical concoction, but I imagine that she might have something to add to the discussion, considering her studies.”

“Well this is the sort of situation I envisioned when I snatched her up,” she assured me, “You go right ahead.”

“You envisioned a situation where an Out-“ I started, but I was cut off by Victorina thumping me on the shoulder repeatedly.

-----

Halea’s next fight, her semi-final match, lasted maybe ninety seconds.

I was expecting a big climactic fight, it was only the semi-finals, but that still meant we were talking about the top four battlemages in the whole fifty plus mage tournament. Well the other Mage’s experience didn’t count for much, not when the whole University’s way of fighting had been turned on its head.

At first I thought that the orange robed Mage had made the right choice. Rather than skulking about in an attempt to flank Halea, which could be risky if she spotted him first, he just stayed in place and made himself ready to face her head on. He cast several spells as Halea dashed from hilltop to hilltop towards him. The first, and most obvious, was the persistent version shield spell that I’d seen in frequent use so far. It covered his whole body, and I guessed that he planned to use it to protect against a sneak attack. Additionally he had another shield spell at the ready, the simple plane of force that Halea had preferred during our practice matches, and he wielded it like a magical tower shield. Finally his other hand held a low powered Lightning Bolt, and it was ready to be thrown at a moment’s notice.

“Why two shields?” I asked Victorina, “The MAC’s strong, but I don’t think it’s that strong.”

“Probably not,” Victorina replied, “But he can probably manage to cast that second shield he’s holding without using any mana at all. It’s a common strategy by the more defensively minded Mages. It will stop light projectile spells entirely, and at least slows down the more powerful ones.”

“Ah, it saves him from spending as much energy on the personal shield?” I asked, and Victorina nodded in reply.

Welp, turns out the MAC spell was that strong.

The Mage in orange robes need not have worried about a sneak attack, since Halea crested the hill right in front of him, but it was a small consolation. The orange Mage loosed first, and Halea cast a shield rather than risk trying to sneak a shot off. The low powered Lighting Bolt smacked into her shield and fizzled out, and only then did she fire. From what I could tell she hadn’t even put that much power behind it, it was more an attack to probe his defences than anything else. It was maybe two mana, used to propel four projectiles? It would have been directly comparable to four rounds fired from a rifle like an M16, which is something that essentially all modern rigid body armour would be able to stop with little trouble.

It cut right through both layers of shielding like they weren’t even there. There were four small flashes from the plane of force held in his outstretched hand as the projectiles passed through, four more flashes from his chest as the projectiles penetrated his full body shield, and that was it, he fell.

“Well,” I said flatly, as the gong rang, “Who was that guy anyway?”

Victorina sighed, “Baron Bronippo, Another one of Diova’s clubmates.”

“Uhh, are we supposed to let them win so Diova doesn’t get pissed off?” I asked, unsure.

“No, of course not,” Victorina replied tiredly, “But beating them this badly doesn’t really endear them to us, now does it.”

“I suppose not, on the other hand, we are kinda kicking ass here,” I grinned.

“You’re welcome,” Minki said quietly, and I laughed.

“Why did it go through the shield so easily though?” I asked, “I mean, the projectiles are moving faster than most elves will be able to imagine, but it’s still only so much energy behind them. If Halea had put ten times as much mana behind a Fireball or something similar, wouldn’t the shield have stopped it then?”

“It would have,” Victorina replied, “I imagine that the trouble is they’re using the wrong sort of shield, I just don’t know why. It seems obvious to me that the normal shield just won’t cut it, and Bronippo is smarter than that. He should have known better.”

“I don’t think so,” Minki said quietly, and almost apologetically, “I don’t think that anyone has any idea what the spell even does yet. They’re probably still trying to figure out what element the spell is based on, I don’t think they’ve even considered the possibility that the spell is used to propel a physical object. The projectiles move so fast that you can’t even see them, we know what the spell is because Quinn told us, they don’t have that advantage.”

Victorina nodded, “That would make sense, let’s just hope that Samala doesn’t figure it out before the fight.”

“I guess that the right sort of shield would stop the projectile?” I asked.

“Yes, there’s two main sorts of shields. You can have one built to stop magical attacks or similar mundane effects, or one built to stop physical attacks. Normally the physical shield is restricted to defending against uneducated men with sharp bits of metal, or Water Elementals,” she said bitterly, “But your spell has changed that.”

“Can you not run both at once?” I asked, “What about Diova’s shield?”

“You can, or rather, there’s a spell that combines the two shields into one. It’s expensive though, so most people don’t bother to add on that second layer. Besides, most of the things you defend against with a physical shield can be seen coming a long way off.”

“Alright,” I nodded, “Who’s Samala then?”

“Deputy Hierarch of The Order of The Claves, he’s actually been the favourite to win I believe,” Victorina explained.

“Deputy Hierarch?”

“A guild Hierarch is the leader of a guild, obviously, and is somewhere between a Count and a Duke. Each guild controls two counties, and all the people and resources that come with those lands. The deputy Hierarchs are about equivalent to Barons,” she clarified, “Though most of the time they don’t actually rule a city.”

“Well, I guess Halea’s not going to make many friends in The Order of The Claves when she takes this guy’s head off,” I said confidently.

# Chapter 44

Quinn

-----

Strictly speaking, she didn’t take his *head* off.

The beginning of the fight was very similar to the one with Bronippo, though Samala didn’t make the same mistakes that Bronippo had. I wasn’t sure if Andrew had gone and told Samala what I’d created, they were potential rivals after all, or if he was just hedging his bets, but when he cast his shields I saw that they were both the purplish colour of the combined Magical-Physical version. He also prepared a projectile spell, though this one was an Acid Ball, rather than a Lightning Bolt. Halea, just as in the previous fight, hopped her way across the arena from hilltop to hilltop, making directly for Samala’s starting position.

Just as last time Halea crested the hill and Samala launched the spell he’d held ready, and used his other hand to put his secondary shield between himself and Halea. Halea blocked it with a shield of her own, just as last time, and then cast the MAC spell at Samala. There was a *crack* as the tiny lead ball was accelerated past the speed of sound, and then two flashes of light, one from each of Samala’s shields. The secondary shield, the plane of force projected from his outstretched hand, snapped out of existence a moment later, but his full body shield prevented the projectile from getting to him.

And then they each did it again, Samala brought his secondary shield back up and threw an Acid Ball, only to be blocked by a shield cast by Halea, and then she cast MAC, which took down his secondary shield but was blocked by Samala’s primary shield. And then they did it again, and again, and again, for ages. Samala tried to manoeuvre a little for a better position, his spot at the bottom of the valley wasn’t great after all, but essentially they were just standing there slugging it out.

*It seems kinda like one or both of them is making a massive strategic error here. I just have no idea who it is. Is it Halea, who is beating seemingly ineffectually on Samala’s shields? Or is it Samala, who is letting Halea drain his mana with every impact on his defences.*

I had to remind myself that Samala, Bronippo, and all the others were in no way fools. A human born fifty thousand years before I was had essentially the same potential as a human born today, or at least, today on Earth. What they lacked were opportunities, and education. This was the same. The elves were not foolish, they just didn’t have anything to compare this spell to. They were trying to fit the spell into their model of how the world worked, when the spell was drawing upon concepts that they couldn’t yet conceive of.

Given time, the spell would become mundane. It would be taught alongside Fireball, Lighting Bolt, Acid Ball, and the others as another in the group of standard projectile spells. Just as Acid Ball’s would be used when you needed to disrupt concentration, or Lightning Bolt would be used to stun an opponent, MAC *which still needs a catchier name* would be the spell to use if you needed to counter an enemy’s shield spell.

Until then though, we were going to be hard as hell to beat.

It was probably four or five minutes into the mutual slugging match when I finally turned to Victorina and asked, “Is there something I’m missing here? It seems an awful lot like neither of them is really being very smart about this. One of them is going to bungle their defence eventually and get hit, and it seems like it could just as easily be Halea as it could be Samala.”

She leaned in a little, “You should give Halea more credit Quinn, I think she’s taking quite good advantage of Samala’s ignorance here.”

“Oh?”

“You’ve been watching as she casts your spell, you know that she’s not putting much mana into it, right?” She asked, and I nodded in reply, “Well Samala doesn’t know that, all he saw is what the spells done to everyone that’s been hit with it. She’s not even cast it with more than two mana over the course of this whole tournament, but every time it *is* cast and it hits, it’s usually enough to end the fight.”

“Alright,” I nodded slowly, “So she’s casting it without much power, probably even for free, but he thinks that there’s a *lot* of mana behind every shot. So, what, he thinks that he’s wearing her out?”

“Exactly,” Victorina confirmed, “And I bet that the effect that the spell is having on his shield is only reinforcing his incorrect assumption. If I had to guess, I’d say that each hit with the spell takes a pretty big chunk out of his shield. It’s meant for crossbow bolts, arrows, and rocks, not whatever this monstrous creation of yours is, and so the spell needs more energy to compensate for that. He’s used to the shield taking less mana to block an attack, than it took to cast the attack. You’ve created a spell that turns that relationship around.”

“So he knows that he’s haemorrhaging mana with every hit by Halea, but he thinks that ’s spending even more by blocking his Acid Balls and casting MAC,” I said, getting it finally, “The only question is how he’s lasted so long then. Seems like this has gone on for a while.”

“Samala is a deputy hierarch, which means he’s by no means a pauper. He’s probably got several mana stones to draw upon,” she explained.

“Does Halea have any?” I asked, “Though I’m guessing that Samala believes that she does.”

“Oh, maybe,” Victorina said, “But she’s probably not drawn on them very much. She’s really only spending mana to block the odd Acid Ball.”

“I guess we just need to wait then,” I said, leaning back in my seat.

*I wonder if I can put together a shield optimized to stop stuff like this. Hell, even Uncle Walsh and his matchlocks would be trouble if shield spells respond poorly to low mass by high velocity projectiles. A musket ball from one of those won’t match even the one mana version of my MAC spell, but they’d be a damn sight faster than an arrow.*

Shields in general seemed rather iffy though, it was the sort of thing that would take a hell of a lot of practice to get right. Not casting the spell itself mind you, that was the easy part. No, the trouble was knowing which one you needed. In the arena that was somewhat easier, since the answer was usually to cast both, but that wasn’t always true, and I wouldn’t always be in the arena. The trick came down to how each version of the spell used energy. The plane of force that both of them were using was very straightforward. For each 1 mana put into it, you could block X amount of stuff. I had no idea what X was, but more mana meant more blockyness. The shield would keep that reserve of… blockyness, until either the spell was cancelled, or it used up that blockyness by blocking incoming attacks. It was tricky, especially since you had to make sure that there was enough energy in the spell to protect you against whatever came at you, but not so much energy that you ended up wasting some. The spell was limited in that you couldn’t put more energy into the shield after it was cast, and if you had enough energy to stop one and a half arrows, well that extra half an arrow’s worth of energy was essentially a waste since you’d still find yourself getting perforated.

The alternative was the full body shield that Samala was using, but it could also result in a massive wasting of energy, depending on the situation. It would automatically adapt to any incoming strike, and would draw exactly enough energy from the caster to stop the attack, which solved the problem of trying to estimate what it would take to stop an attack on the fly. The problem was that it also took energy to keep the shield in place. It wasn’t a lot, but it wasn’t zero either.

So the arithmetic came down to whether that additional energy expenditure was worth the additional benefits. It could entirely eliminate energy lost to overestimation, but on the other hand it was still a constant drain on your reserves. Was one more of the burden than the other? Well the answer would depend on the mage.

What it meant for Halea and Samala though, was that Samala was quickly running out of reserves, while Halea was relatively fresh. It only took another minute or so for those reserves to run dry, and Samala’s shield snapped off. Halea positively leapt off her feet in exultation when it happened, and there was a loud *BOOM* as she cast the spell again, evidently with a hell of a lot more power behind it. To his credit, Samala didn’t panic when his shield went down. I supposed that he must have seen it coming, as his mana and mana stone reserves started to run dry, and he still tried one last ditch defence. He had completed the casting of Deflect just as Halea finished her super-charged MAC, and did his best to use it to fend off the incoming projectile.

It sort of worked.

He caught it early, which probably helped a great deal, but it wasn’t enough. All it meant was that instead of drilling him in the chest with a round the might have been fired from a .50 calibre machinegun, she instead hit him in the shoulder. He went down hard, his shoulder a bloody mess, and his arm landed a couple feet behind him in the dirt. The gong rang, signalling an end to the match, and to the tournament. Halea had won.

*I really hope they’re not too sour about it if I run into them at the ball.*


# Chapter 45

Quinn

-----

*At least I don’t need to wear a tie.*

All in all, it actually wasn’t too terrible. Since I’d already opted to have all of my robes made of silk and properly tailored, my ‘formal’ robes weren’t much different from what I normally wore. The formal robes weren’t as short as most of the more regular wear robes I had, but still gave me plenty of room to move. Most men’s robes, along with most women’s robes, fell somewhere between ankle and mid-calf. The robes I wore now, as I inspected myself in the mirror, were knee length.

It wasn’t any spectacular fashion statement that I was making, or at least, that’s not what I was trying to do. The standard mage robes just looked too much like dresses to me, and wearing robes cut in the normal style would have just made me feel self-conscious. What I’d ordered instead for myself as an alternative looked more like a trench coat, in the case of the robes I was wearing now, or a hoodie, in the case of the robes I normally wore.

I left my room to go track down Victorina, and my shoes clicked noisily on the floor as I walked down the hall. The clubhouse felt very empty, with most of the others having left hours ago to go meet with their families. Brandy of course was the odd one out, she’d made no claim to high birth and so wasn’t expected to go to the ball. She probably couldn’t in fact, since even wealthy merchant families apparently had a hard time coming up with an excuse to show up. She might have gone as someone’s date, and in fact she’d been given several offers to that end. I knew she’d been given several offers, because she told us about it, frequently. She turned them down however, having gotten herself invited to one of the parties that would be running for the less privileged but still very wealthy students, and so was also absent from the clubhouse.

Victorina hadn’t been in her room, which was across from mine in the left wing of the clubhouse, so I went to check with Thera. She was the only other one still in the clubhouse, since she was too lower class by most estimations, and not nearly as interesting as an Outsider. I heard a thump from Thera’s room as I came down the hall, and saw that the door was standing open. I could hear both Victorina and Thera, and what I heard was rather interesting.

There was another thump, as if someone was pushed into a table, and then that table was in turn pushed into a wall. There was an extended groan from one of them, followed by the sound of heavy and rapid breathing.

“Come on Thera,” I heard Victorina say, voice tight with extortion, “Come on, almost… there…” she said, voice getting high and short at the end, followed by a gasp.

“Oh would you stop moving,” Thera growled, “I’m not quite done yet,” and there was another thump of furniture, and a gasp from Victorina.

I knocked lightly on the doorframe, and there was sudden silence from inside.

Then Thera said, voice still straining, “What?”

“Uh, are you two alright in there?” I called through the open door, very confused.

“I’m just tying Vicky’s corset, give us a minute,” she said, and there was another thump from inside.

I waited, as commanded, while Thera tied the corset and then helped Victorina into her dress. I was eventually rewarded for my patience, when Victorina stepped out into the hall. She looked stunning, from head to toe. Her hair looked like a sheet of molten steel, and cascaded over and down both shoulders. Her skin looked flawless, with just a touch of colour added around the eyes and lips. It looked like she’d gone fairly light on the makeup, though for all I knew, that just meant that she had plenty on, but expertly applied. Her dress was only loosely related to the robes of the university, and was more like a formal gown that had been designed to take inspiration from the normal garb of Mages. It was very conservative, at least by my own standards, though I knew that she was pushing the limit of acceptability when it came to the perceptions of other elves of privilege. To them the amount of leg and chest she was showing would be considered almost scandalous, when in fact the dress fell all the way to mid-calf, and only just cut low enough for her collar bone to be visible. The work that her corset was doing was very clear to see around her waist and bust, which is not to say that she normally had any excess around the waist, or deficiency in the bust. No, Victorina was cast from the same mold as Halea and Thera, which is to say she already looked like a bombshell. The corset only served to amplify that, drawing the waist in further, and supporting the bust. She was also wearing absolutely murderous heels, which seemed an awful lot like overkill. She was already as tall as any of the tallest elf men I’d met so far, and towered over any elf woman that came to mind. With the heels though? Well, realistically speaking she was still nearly a foot shorter than me, but that still meant that she would stand inches taller than any man at the ball.

She raised an eyebrow, turning her head to look at me out of the corner of her eye, “Do you like it?” she asked hesitantly.

“Of course,” I answered, “You look lovely.”

She smiled, and then said sternly, “Well good. But I was rather hoping for more of a reaction, I did go to a whole lot of trouble after all, a woman does like a little validation now and then. And then I step out and do the big reveal, and you barely bat an eye.”

“Trust me,” I said, “Behind this stern visage is a man that is positively drooling.”

“Perfect, now that’s the sort of reaction I’m looking for,” she said.

“Have fun,” Thera called from her room, “I know I will.”

I raised an eyebrow as Victorina took my arm and we left for the waiting carriage.

“She’s meeting Abis tonight,” Victorina explained, “The one that got her with that Verridisiac potion?”

“Ah,” I nodded, “Actually, I know money might suddenly become tight at some point, but have you considered whether it would be worth it to bring Abis on board?”

Victorina shook her head, “I’ve thought about a second alchemist, but not Abis. Those two have a hard enough time as it is, without also living together, that would only draw unwanted attention. I don’t know how it is where you come from Quinn, but here, Abis could find herself disinherited if her liaisons with Thera are discovered.”

I nodded, “Humans from certain places in the world, or in some more conservative communities, might very well have the same reaction. It’s unfortunate.”

“Yes, yes it is,” Victorina said.

-----

It was as we were riding in the carriage, Victorina sitting across from me and looking beautiful, that I suddenly became very aware of just what the fucking hell I was doing. I was going to a ball, with Kings, Dukes, Counts, and Barons. I was escorting an actual, honest to god princess, to that ball. Oh, and I had magic powers.

Just how the hell had I ended up here? I was a computer science student less than a year ago. I went to lectures, did homework, and played videogames. That was it, and somehow I manage to transition from that, to princesses and magic, without losing my mind. I’d fallen through a portal, into another world, and had just taken it all in stride. Shouldn’t that have been a bigger deal?

*I’m a university student, and I’m about fifteen minutes away from a ball where I’m probably going to need to deal with* ***multiple*** *members of royalty bitching at me for creating a spell to whoop their asses. Oh yeah, I’m totally prepared for that.*

“Quinn?” I heard Victorina say, in a tone that made it sound like she’d repeated herself a couple of times already.

“Yeah?” I asked, looking up suddenly.

“Are you alright?” she asked gently, raising her eyebrows, “You looked like a rabbit caught between two wolves for a moment there.”

“I’m okay,” I replied, “Just had a brief Moment Of Clarity, I’m fine.”

*Kings, yes, Dukes and Counts too, but those are only titles. What matters is what power they’ve actually got. There’s a little less than a billion people on this whole continent, maybe eighty million of those are in Ashur. Ashur is split three ways between Diova’s father, and the other two kings. So roughly twenty six million people are subjects of Diova’s father, roughly the population of Australia. Am I scared of the Prime Minister of Upside Down Canada? Fuck no.*

-----

The ball was held at the League of Patrician’s guild hall, and much like the Prefecture of Ariros guild hall, this place wasn’t just some particularly large house, it was a castle. I was reminded of a trip I’d taken with my family to see relatives in Ireland. We’d gone to Blarney Castle because Andrew seemed to think that kissing some sort of rock would make him better with women, and this looked very much like that castle and its grounds.

There was a bit of a wait while the carriages ahead of us dropped off their occupants, but eventually it was our turn, and I pushed open the door and ducked out. I turned and offered my hand to Victorina as she disembarked, and she took it. She stumbled a little on her spike like heels, but I managed to steady her awkwardly with one arm, lowering her gently to her feet to the cobblestones of the path that lead to the front gates of the League’s guildhall.

“Thank you,” she said, flicking her hair back with one hand, “I may be a little unused to wearing such footwear.”

“No?” I asked, “I would have thought that you’d be doing this sort of thing all the time.”

“I do, in fact, do this all the time. Generally though I’m already as tall or taller than whichever foppish nobleman I’m accompanying, and that makes them uppity enough on its own. Wearing heels would only further damage their fragile egos. Well,” she said, clearly pleased, “Now I can wear whatever I damn well please. In fact, it’s probably a good thing I opted for such extreme footwear, I’d look fairly tiny next to you without it.”

“You *want* to wear heels?” I asked, as she took my arm and we walked through the gates and to the massive wooden doors set into the side of the guildhall itself, “Those can’t be comfortable.”

“It doesn’t matter if they’re comfortable Quinn,” she said, as if that should be obvious, “They make my legs look amazing, even if they are mostly hidden under my gown, and it makes me feel fantastic.”

“Rah rah, girl power,” I said, doing my best to make a fist.

“Girl power?” she asked, with a raised eyebrow.

“Ask Brandy, she’ll know all about that sort of thing.”

-----

I let Victorina take the lead as we mingled with the guests, and we went from group to group making niceties. A lot of time was spent speaking, but saying nothing at all. Or at least, that’s what I thought this was. For all I knew Victorina was engaged in some deep and sophisticated verbal fencing, but to me it all sounded like a lot of nothing.

“Hmm,” Victorina said as we were leaving a little clutch of lesser nobles, “You see Diova over there?”

“Yeah,” I nodded, “What about it? Should we be trying to avoid him?”

“I don’t know that avoiding him will get us very far,” she said, “No, I was more interested in how he’s slowly been moving his way over to us since we arrived.”

“It’s not like we’ve been hard to pin down, why doesn’t he just come talk to us?” I asked, and I got a wry look from Victorina in reply, “I guess that’s not how nobles do things?”

“No,” she said, “Besides, not too far behind us is King Tanaka. He’s also been trying to make his way towards us, though he’s got to drag all his hangers on along as well, which has slowed him down rather a lot.”

“Diova’s not with his father?”

“No,” Victorina confirmed, “Which is interesting, though I doubt the split is anything world shattering.”

“So they each want the chance to talk to us, but don’t want to be seen rushing, and for whatever reason, they disagree on exactly how that conversation should go,” I mused.

Victorina nodded, “That’s looking at it rather simply, but yes.”

“Can King Tanaka just ‘request’ our presence or something?” I asked.

“Oh certainly, but again-“

“It’s very direct,” I finished.

“If he was going to be direct, he would have requested that we attend him. He’s not about to stoop to the level of being seen to seek us out, unless of course he can make it look like happenstance.”

“Well, let’s go talk to Diova then,” I said, as I started to walk towards the little group he’d inserted himself into.

“Quinn, slow down,” she said, having trouble keeping up with my long strides in those heels, “And just why are you so eager to speak to him?”

“I’ve got a dumb idea I want to try,” I replied.

------

Diova saw us as we approached, and made a smooth exit from group he was conversing with, and we met him at one of the large tables set to the side of the large ballroom. He had the young Baron Bronippo with him, and both of the men had a woman with them, neither of whom I recognized. Bronippo’s companion though wore orange, as he did, and Diova’s partner was wearing a flowing gold dress. Diova was tall for an elf, and would have been eye to eye with Victorina had she not been wearing heels. In the heels though, she was quite a bit taller than either Diova or Bronippo, and was amazonic compared to the two women.

“Quinn.”

“Diova.”

“I suppose that you’re the one responsible for that spell.”

“The concept, yes. Minki helped me actually create the spell however.”

He leaned slightly to one side, to look past me “Well, it has certainly displeased my father.”

“You don’t seem that broken up about it though, despite the rather abrupt end to your run in today’s tournament.”

“These things happen, and it doesn’t always take an Outsider to create the spell that disrupts the balance in the arena,” he said evenly.

“What’s it going to take to satisfy your father then?” I asked.

“He wants the spell banned, for Halea to be punished for cheating, and for my loss to be stricken from the records.”

“Cheating?” I asked, raising an eyebrow.

“Yes.”

“Well, what about you then?” I asked, looking him in the eye.

“What about me?”

“What is it going to take to satisfy *you*, and encourage you to call off your father?”

I got a variety of looks from all those assembled, though Victorina’s was more exasperation than anything else.

“Very direct of you,” Diova said.

“We’re working on that,” Victorina replied.

I just shrugged, “Earth is a direct sort of place. And it’s certainly quicker.”

“An impatient place as well, apparently,” Diova said, “It would be enough for you to describe the principles behind the function of the spell, and for you to explain just how the spell does what it does.”

*How long would it take him to replicate the spell himself? If I tell him only that it accelerates a small projectile very quickly, then it’s going to take him only a couple of days to knock something together. But it won’t be complete. I knew for example, that I needed to apply the force in a certain way, and that the bullet needed a spin imparted upon it. If he’s missing both of those, then accuracy is probably going to be so awful as to make it unusable without a great deal of experimentation. They’d get it eventually, but it would take time, and all this at little gain. No gain even, since I’d be giving the secret away to restore the status quo. Or… I could try my dumb plan.*

“What if I sold you the spell, under certain conditions,” I asked.

“Quinn!” Victorina said, quietly, but harshly.

Diova raised his eyebrows, “What sort of conditions?”

“That you’d only share it with members of your club, and only the current members of your club, Andrew excepted. They’d be under the same restriction, and should they leave they couldn’t then share it with whichever club they join. Additionally, if you gain new members, you’d be unable to share it with them. Only after a period of four years and one day would these restrictions be lifted. Oh, and also you boot Andrew out of your club.”

“Is that all?” Diova asked, eyebrow cocked.

“Yes,” I nodded, “Well, and you give me a bunch of money.”

“You would be, in effect, depriving me of the only other source of Outsider knowledge by having me ‘boot’ Andrew from the club. And it would likely alienate both Andrew himself, as well as his father.”

I shrugged, “I suppose, but do you care that much about one Count and his son? I’m perfectly willing to give you the general idea and be done with it, but I can see it taking a while for you to actually get the spell working as well as I have. Besides, from what I’ve seen the only thing of note that he’s created is his upgraded Acid Jet spell. And if what I’ve heard is true, he’s not deigned to share it either.”

“There’s also his Blink spell,” Diova noted, “No one I know of, not in a thousand years, has managed to create a teleport spell that works nearly as well as his does.”

“You’re speaking specifically of the way that he can cast it quickly, teleport, and then immediately resume fighting from his new location?”

“Yes,” he confirmed, “The speed at which he can cast it I can account for. He’s specialized the spell for short, rather than long range use. That’s not hard, anyone can do that. The trouble is that when anyone else has tried to do it, it only results in even more disorientation than the standard spell.”

“So Blink, and Acid Jet?” I asked, “That’s all he’s created in a year? And he’s shared none of it?”

Diova spread his hands and tilted his head to the side, “That is rather reductive, but yes, that is the case.”

“Tell you what, same terms I just outlined, but I also throw in Andrew’s Acid Jet, and Blink. Those two would not be covered by the non-disclosure part of the agreement, sell those, tell everyone, whatever, I don’t care.”

“That is certainly a tempting offer,” Diova said, “But why are you so adamant that Andrew must find a place elsewhere?”

“Spite, mostly,” I said matter-of-factly, “And I don’t want him learning my new spell.”

“I think we should take the deal,” Baron Bronippo said, “I mean, what are we really losing? Andrew already spends most of his time with Mages from the Order. Sometimes it seems like he only joined our club because his father told him to. You tap things just the right way and you could get him to leave on his own, and if Lord Walsh’s ire is directed anywhere, it won’t be at you. And it’s not like we’re going to get him to share his spells any other way. For all we know, he’s already sharing with The Claves.”

Diova nodded, “Alright, and addendum to the terms then.”

“Alright,” I said, “I’m listening.”

“You’d also be bound by the non-disclosure terms, and wouldn’t be able to sell the spell either until the deal has run its course,” he said.

I nodded, “Fair enough, what else?”

“Both of our clubs are not yet full. So, counting Andrew’s current spot as vacant, we’d both be able to invite as many new people as we have vacant slots, and still share the spell with them. In your case, I believe that means five new club members, in my case, three. Once Andrew is gone.”

I looked to Victorina, who nodded reluctantly.

“It’s good that you’ve got permission,” Diova said, with a light in his eyes, “Now how expensive is this extortion likely to be?”

I looked at him under my brows, which was hard, since he was over a foot shorter than me, and then reluctantly looked to Victorina again. Diova chuckled a little, but then I honestly had no idea what the spell was even worth, and had no idea where to start haggling.

They eventually settled on a year of rent for the clubhouse, and I noticed that the way things were phrased, that it would be a year regardless of whether or not our rent was raised in that time. Diova would pay up, which is to say stop charging us rent, once Andrew had left his club. Only then would Diova be given the spell. I would however, be providing the Acid Jet and Blink spells as soon as was convenient.

“You may send a courier when it is convenient for you,” Diova had said, “You know where my clubhouse resides.”

“Actually,” I said, reaching within my robes to fish the books out of a concealed belt pouch, “You can have them now.”

Diova seemed surprised, but took the two offered books, one much thicker than the other. One was a notebook, with my complete notes and symbols on the new Acid Jet. The other…

“I understand what this is,” he said, lifting the thin notebook, “But this… this is just a copy of Teleportation For Minor Mages.”

“The Acid Jet was simple,” I said, smiling, “All he’d done is replace the standard acid that the spell used, acetic acid, with a more powerful acid, hydrochloric acid. For all I know, this version of the spell is even more powerful that Andrew’s, since he’s probably using the wrong ratio of water to acid. As for Blink, there is a version of a short ranged teleport in that book.”

“Yes,” Diova said, “But then, I’m not interested in *that* version of a short ranged teleport, I want Blink.”

“You’ve met Andrew, and you’re generally familiar with how hard he applies himself, right?” I asked.

“Yes,” Diova said warily, “Your point?”

“Do you *really* think he has the inclination, or the ability, to create something that no elf has been able to do in a thousand years?” I asked.

Diova seemed to consider this for a second, “Perhaps not, but then Outsiders always find new ways to warp what magic can do. Your spell is a prime example, no one has designed such a spell like that either. Not in a thousand, or any other number of years.”

“I had a very specific example to draw upon in my case, something to replicate, and I already understood the physical principles that governed how the spell would work, if not the magical ones. Teleportation though? That’s not possible on Earth. No, I know what Andrew did, he recognized what I recognized. Which is that humans are much more resilient to the post-teleportation nausea than elves. I can barely feel it when I do a long distance teleport, even the first time ever, when I should have been the most susceptible, I barely noticed. If my eyes had been closed, I might not have been able to tell exactly when the teleport happened. If a faster and shorter teleport increases disorientation, then that would account for Andrew’s unsteadiness after casting the spell,” I explained, ”Andrew didn’t create anything new. No, Andrew tried the spell while he was looking for things to use in the arena, and one day while he was practicing, someone noticed that he wasn’t nearly as disoriented afterwards and assumed that he’d invented a new spell. Andrew was content to take the credit for such a discovery, and didn’t say anything. No *elf* in a thousand years has been able to do this, but then Andrew is no elf.”

“That’s conjecture,” Diova said levelly, “That’s not proof, what about the spell Minki cast? She *is* an elf, and she suffered less disorientation even than Andrew did.”

“That was an illusion, done almost entirely to piss off Andrew,” I said, “And also because it helped Minki win or whatever.”

Diova laughed, “And I thought Andrew was strange, even for an Outsider. But you, you’re like nothing else.”

“Thanks?” I said, “I think? I’ve checked with Brandy as well, and she reports the same thing that I do. Neither of us have had a chance to test it since neither of us know the shorter teleport, but for both of us a long ranged teleport causes effectively no disorientation.”

“I suppose that it’s not proof, but it has the ring of truth to it. I find this acceptable.”

With the business concluded there were some brief niceties, before we finally split. We spent a little more time mingling with other guests, and I stayed quiet while Victorina engaged in either unimportant small talk or subtle political manoeuvring. It was hard to tell one from the other.

I had thought that we might see some of our clubmates while wandering around, but I got the distinct impression that their companions were doing their best to keep the girls away from Victorina and myself. They probably didn’t like the idea of their potential brides living in the same house as such a spectacularly handsome, fit, intelligent, well endowed, and impressive specimen of humanity. Or at least, that’s what I told myself.

# Chapter 46

Quinn

-----

“Still holding on there Quinn?” Victorina asked.

“What? Oh, yeah, I’m fine,” I said, doing my best to relax.

We’d been at the ball for a while, and while it had been as Victorina had promised and I hadn’t been expected to dance, I was still getting a little uncomfortable. Whenever I was in a social situation like this I had to be absolutely switched on, for fear of saying or doing something foolish, and eventually the fatigue from that would build up to the point that I’d start looking for a way to make a graceful exit. Worse still, I normally didn’t also need to contend with the extra layer of complexity that royalty and nobility added to the mix, and that probably added somewhat to my discomfort. I was here with Victorina though, so I’d been doing my best to put up with it, and I’d actually done a fair job of it so far.

“Do you want to leave?” she asked, “We can leave if you’d like.”

“Honestly? Yes,” I said, “But don’t you have more people to talk to, and wouldn’t it garner notice if we left early?”

She shook her head, “It’d be fine, and the ball itself is wrapping up anyways. Most people will be going off to have private little conversations elsewhere in the keep, it won’t draw too much notice for us to leave.”

“Alright then,” I said, “Let’s get the hell out of here.”

Victorina raised an eyebrow, but didn’t comment on my remark as we left the ballroom.

I took a deep breath and looked around as we stepped out into the cool night air, and I took a moment to appreciate the scent of a coming rain on the breeze. It was rather scenic, and while the forests weren’t nearly so thick here as they were around the Ariros guildhall, some work had clearly gone into keeping them maintained. The guild hierarch probably wasn’t nearly as concerned with invaders using the trees as cover, as with making the place look nice. The forests around the guildhall also screened the castle from the peasants that occupied the kilometres and kilometres of farmland that stretched out to the south.

Distance was definitely something that got confused when teleportation was possible, and I had to remind myself sometimes of just how far apart everything was. When I’d first escaped Adympia I’d covered the distance between the Ashur-Adympian border, to the University, in only a few hours. For the average elf, who didn’t have someone to teleport them, that trip would take months. Even my brief trip to go see King Nezzabi would have been a journey of at least a week, had we gone on foot.

The distances involved where the University’s lands were concerned also took some time to wrap one’s head around. The League and Prefecture of Ariros guildhalls being so close to the University was not the norm, and conveyed a great deal of political power. Or at least, it conveyed a great deal of power to the League of Patricians. With the Ariros guildhall vacant, they were the only guild with lands or holdings within over a hundred kilometres. The proximity gave them quite a bit more influence over the city, and it gave them a good excuse to host functions like the ball. I’d heard it repeated a couple times, that each guild held the equivalent of two counties, but I hadn’t really been sure what that meant until I’d had a chance to take a good look at the right maps. Even having taken more than my share of university level history courses, I still found myself thinking of ‘counties’ in the modern North American sense, but that was very much the wrong comparison. A county here wasn’t a few hundred, or even a thousand, square kilometres like it might be on modern Earth. No, it was very much the old meaning of county, which meant that *average* Nimrean county was about five thousand square kilometres. Some, like those that were the de jure lands of the Prefecture of Ariros, were as much as twice that size. This meant that the University’s lands, not even considering the rest of Nimre, were about the same size as Ireland. Nimre as a whole was roughly the same size as the United Kingdom, though it was one contiguous landmass, and not arranged as a collection of islands.

“So Diova is his father’s heir, right? No other kids between him and the throne?” I asked, as we walked from the doors of the keep to the gates of the curtain wall that surrounded the guild hall.

“Yes, he has both a brother and a sister,” Victorina said, “But both are younger, and neither are Mages.”

“But his father will have the same immortality spell cast on him that we have, won’t he?”

“Yes,” she nodded, “You’re wondering how Diova would ever succeeded to the throne I imagine?”

“Yeah, and not just Diova. Take Nezzabi for example, he’s two hundred and fifty something. Why isn’t his, I don’t know, six hundred year old father still around and running things?”

“Well, live long enough and there will be enough chances for something to get you in the end. The spell might grant immortality, in the technical sense, but what it really grants is youth. Without the spell the oldest elves can live to be four hundred years old, but that is the absolute limit. Between about three hundred and four hundred the body is very weak, susceptible to disease, and even a simple slip and fall can be dangerous. The fragility that comes with age can start even earlier if they’ve not taken care of their own health. The immortality spell prevents much of that weakness from ever showing itself, but it doesn’t prevent the diseases and accidents themselves. It just makes the subject of the spell better able to face those challenges, since they’d be facing them in the body of a young man or woman.”

“How well does magical healing work against disease then?”

She shook her head, “Not too well, it some ways it’s like the case with your hands or your eyes. Much of what disease does is too complex for a simple healing spell to solve. Treating the symptoms is much easier, but that doesn’t actually stop the disease from doing its damage. A Mage might be able to make someone with Smallpox comfortable, if they’re willing to risk their lives to do so, but the patient will still likely die of it. Actually,” she grumbled, “If magic worked better against those sorts of things, then I wouldn’t need to worry myself about my own father’s succession. It might be called an immortality spell, but realistically most monarchs with the spell don’t tend to live past six or seven hundred.”

I frowned in thought, and wished briefly that I’d been born just a generation earlier, before dismissing the thought as foolish. I would have been vaccinated as a child against Smallpox, like both of my parents, but then I would have been growing up in a time where video gaming was crap and the internet didn’t exist. Was having the internet worth the chance of maybe getting Smallpox on the off chance I got thrown into another dimension? Probably.

“What is it Quinn?” she asked, noting my pensive expression, “How were such diseases tended to on Earth?”

“Well it rather depends on the time period,” I replied, “And on the specific sort of smallpox. Mostly though, you hoped not to get it. I don’t know what the figures are for elves, but ordinary smallpox would kill about thirty percent of the humans that fell victim to it.”

“That’s actually relatively tame, compared to the effect smallpox has on elves. It’s just a guess,” she hedged, “But I believe the figure would be fifty, rather than thirty percent.”

“Well there were worse strains as well,” I continued, “That had fatality rates as high as ninety or even one hundred percent.”

“Were?” She asked, eyebrow raised.

“Yes, were,” I nodded, “It would have been about two hundred and fifty years ago when humans started to figure out how to fight the disease, though ‘fight’ is probably the wrong word. Prevention is more appropriate. Someone figured out that it was enough to infect someone with cowpox, to grant them immunity to smallpox. The diseases were close enough to one another, that the same way someone who survived smallpox couldn’t get it again, someone that had cowpox couldn’t then get smallpox. Before that there was inoculation, though that was much more dangerous, and basically involved intentionally infecting someone with a weak form of the disease. Even that could have a fatality rate of as much as ten percent.”

“What about now?” She asked, “You said ‘were’, as if the disease was no longer a concern.”

“It’s not,” I replied, “It’s been eradicated entirely. Better even than inoculation, or the use of cowpox, is vaccination. Even treatment with cowpox has a not insignificant degree of risk, but vaccination is almost entirely safe for humans whose immune systems haven’t been weakened in some way. So between sixty and forty years ago they vaccinated everyone. My parent’s generation were the last ones in Canada to receive the vaccine. I was born too late to get it, which is mildly inconvenient if the disease is still present on Elardia.”

“Everyone?” Victorina asked, slightly shocked, “How many people would that have been? What kind of expense must have been gone to, for such an undertaking like that?”

“Back in the eighties? Oh, there were about four and a half billion people,” I said, “And it was a massive undertaking, but imagine what smallpox can do in a population that size. Without even any notable outbreaks occurring, a couple million people would die every year to the disease. And it wasn’t nearly as simple as the wealthier countries simply vaccinating themselves, and calling the deed done. The disease had to be gone, eradicated, otherwise the rich countries would still find that their population was at least somewhat susceptible. Some people just can’t be vaccinated, whether they’re too young, old, or there’s something else involved. It’s by having everyone else, and in this case it really was *everyone* else, vaccinated that they protected these people as well. So the big two at the time, the United States, and the Soviet Union, along with some other major powers, saw to it that those less wealthy nations were still able to protect their citizens.”

“And all that without magic,” Victorina said softly.

“Yeah,” I nodded, “Don’t worry, it’s on my list.”

*No idea how to make vaccines, but the cowpox thing should work just fine. As long as the elven immune system isn’t too much weaker than a human’s.*

I was distracted from my thoughts, when I noticed how Victorina was looking at me. It was some strange combination of surprise, admiration, and exasperation.

“What?” I said defensively, “It’s a long list. There’s all sorts of stuff on there.”

-----

We had no trouble finding a carriage once we got to the gates. I’d been worried that none would be waiting when we got there, since we were leaving a tad early, but I need not have worried. There were a couple of carriages waiting, probably for the odd couple that might decide to turn in early. One particularly eager carriage driver practically drove through one of his counterparts in his attempt to be the one to serve us, and it seemed like he needed the business. His carriage was in good shape, and was fairly indistinguishable from the others. It was just as fancy as the one we’d arrived in, or as any of the others waiting by the gate. His horses were in rougher shape though, and looked less like the well groomed beasts that had brought us here, and more like a couple of particularly pretty work horses. The man himself was a little better off than his beasts, but not by much. He wore the same not-uniform that the other drivers wore, but his had not been tended to quite as well, and was not tailored quite so well.

I didn’t particularly care though, as long as he got me away from the ball, and back to the clubhouse. I opened the door for Victorina, and she put a hand on my elbow as I did my best to help her up into the carriage.

Victorina settled into the seat across from me, and I rested my head against the window as the carriage pulled away from the guildhall. It was a few minutes later, and the first drops of rain had just started to spatter the windows, when Victorina spoke up.

“Why so adamant that Andrew not know your spell?” she asked.

“It’s like I told Diova, spite mostly,” I replied, still watching the rain drops trickle down the window.

“Has there always been so much antagonism between your two branches of the family?”

I yawned and stretched, as best I could in the small space, “No actually. Sure, Andrew and his brothers were always more interested in sports or other physical pursuits, and I was always more interested in books, games, that sort of thing. And as you can imagine that led to the sorts of inter-familial conflicts that you can expect between children and teenagers with vastly differing interests. It was never more than that though. I always thought that Andrew and his brothers were a bunch of dumb jocks, and they always thought that I was a specky nerd, but it was all fairly harmless. Even Uncle Walsh, he was always loud and bombastic, but he was a perfectly nice person. He was big on the importance of family, and he was often the one to call off Andrew or his brothers when things were taken too far.”

“I’ve done some poking around,” Victoria mentioned, “And from what I’ve heard about your Uncle, he’s a just and kind ruler by anyone’s standards. More just and kind even, than most nobles I’ve met or heard of. He’s been cracking down both on abuse of power by his lesser nobles, and on violence against women in his lands. Andrew on the other hand is a miserable creature, and he acts like some of the worst sorts of nobles.”

I nodded, “I can see how it would turn out that way. It’s only when someone would ‘talk back’ to him that my Uncle would ever really get mad. He’s very much an old-school sort of guy, and part of his focus on family was that his kids should do what he, the head of the family, damn well tells them to do. Since I showed up on Elardia alone he’ll view me as part of his family, which is awfully sweet of him, but it also means that he expects the same sort of obedience as the rest of them. As for corruption and violence against women, yeah, I can see how he’d lay the smack down on anyone that he catches doing it. Earth is considerably more forward thinking than Elardia, even in the case of someone as old fashioned as Uncle Walsh,” I sighed, “Andrew though, I can see him turning into a right bastard with the right impetus. In a single stroke he goes from being just an average kid, to a nobleman with superpowers. Or at least, he’s the direct heir to nobility. And with the amount of talent he has, he’s, what, one in five billion? So he doesn’t just have super powers, he has the *most* superpowers.”

Victoria ran a hand through her hair, “Other than Brandy, there’s no one else at the University with that much talent. Even considering those just a bit below him in terms of talent, there are so few, that in some respects he’s in a class of his own. The difference is not so much as he might think though.”

“Really?” I asked, this was news to me.

“Right, Lili still hasn’t had a chance to go too into magical theory in that much depth yet,” Victorina said, taking a deep breath, which made her chest rise and fall in interesting ways, “You’ve probably noticed this already, but magical talent isn’t the only factor in a Mage’s strength, though it does help a great deal. The other factor, well, not the only other factor, but the one that matters the most, is intelligence.”

I smirked, “Yes, exactly,” she said, “Intelligence can make up for a lack of talent, or if not a lack, at least a difference. Take you and Andrew for example, since you seem so pleased with the comparison,” she teased, “He probably learns a spell in half the time that you or I do, but that’s not such a huge amount of time.”

“Especially not when it’s only a difference of four or so hours,” I noted.

She nodded, “More if you want a more detailed understanding of the spell, but yes. Not only that, but if you both put the bare minimum into learning a spell, you might still come out a bit ahead in understanding. Assuming of course, that you’re as smart as you act.”

I smiled, “Oh, I’m probably not as smart as I think I am, but I am smarter than other people think I am,” I said confidently, “What about this intelligence stuff though, is that a matter of being smarter about the use of a spell, or does it actually confer a greater understanding?”

“Both, and it’s actually enough of a difference that if a Mage is particularly clever, she might be allowed into the club stream, when she might otherwise be restricted to the lecture stream,” she explained.

“Really? So there’s some talent three Mages in clubs then?” I asked.

“Some,” she confirmed, “Not many, but some. Enough of a gulf in talent, and no degree of intelligence will really make up for the difference, but it’s enough for some talent three Mages to get themselves bumped up to our level. Or at least, close to our level. The main problem though, and it’s something that you’ll want to watch for if you ever find yourself fighting in the arena, or matching your skills against a Mage elsewhere, is how your talent interacts with another Mage’s spells.”

“I’m guessing that more talented Mages are more resistant to magic than less talented ones?” I asked.

“More or less. It’s the difference in talent that matters, more so than the absolute value of each Mage’s talent, since it also works the other way around.”

“Enough of a difference and the more talented Mage will be able to break through someone’s defences easier?”

“Yes, and that’s in addition to the effect that knowing the spell well will have,” she clarified.

“And a highly talented Mage is likely to know the spell *very* well,” I said, rubbing at my chin.

“So add on the effect that a large difference in talent will have, and you can imagine why there are some places where nothing will make up for too wide a gap. Well,” she hedged, “Unless you’re a dwarf.”

“The innate magic resistance?” I asked.

She nodded, “Even Andrew would have trouble trying to affect Neferoy with any sort of magic, despite their difference in talent. That’s actually a fight I’d like to see, the two of them going at it in the arena.”

“The arena,” I sighed, “That probably has something to do with why Andrew’s ended up the way that he has.”

“What do you mean?”

“Well, I already mentioned the sudden rise to nobility and super powers,” I said, and Victorina nodded for me to continue, “Well on top of that we’ve also got the arena. A place where he can go and do, basically whatever he wants, with no consequences. Hell, he’s applauded for it. It’s not even his penchant for acid that bothers me, maybe it's a little cold, but it does seem like a pretty sound strategy to use. The problem I think is that he seems to take pleasure in it. I think he’s looking at this whole thing like he’s the hero from some videogame, er…” I hesitated, trying to come up with some equivalent to a videogame for someone that had never seen one, “Videogame, story, fairy tale, whatever, where’s there’s no real consequences, where it’s all pretend. And the giant arena where nothing really matters in the end, probably doesn’t help him get a good grasp on the situation.”

“You’re suggesting that there’s something wrong…” Victorina trailed off, spinning one finger around one pointed ear.

I shrugged, “It certainly messed with my head when I first arrived, hell, it still messes with my head when I think about it too much. I could see how he could fall into that trap. Add the massive psychological kick in the head, to suddenly receiving substantial political, and massive magical power, and yeah, it makes sense.”

*The misfortune that tends to come to formerly impoverished winners of the lottery springs to mind.*

“But you’re still going to restrict what is shared with him, try to one up him by handing over a copy of his Acid Jet to Diova, and see to it that he’s kicked out of his club?” Victorina asked, with a wry smile, “Don’t you think you might gain more by trying to settle your differences?”

I thought about it for a moment. She was right after all, or at least, very much not wrong. Me being a dick to him probably wouldn’t help things along, and while he did start it, that wasn’t the mentality to have if you were trying to end the cycle of retribution. On the other hand…

“Nah, fuck ‘em,” I said, rather cavalier about it, “It’s not my job to try to teach him the error of his ways, and make him into a better person.”

Victorina raised her eyebrows, “Got better things to do, have you?”

I huffed out an amused breath, “Honestly? Yeah, but realistically, do you really think that I’d be capable of doing something like that? I wouldn’t even know where to begin, that’s definitely Uncle Walsh’s domain. He’s got the social intelligence that I lack, and besides which, Andrew’s his son.”

“You could start by not antagonizing him,” she said, almost chastising in tone, “And I think you’re better than you realize Quinn. It seems like sometimes you overthink things, take Minki for example, I don’t think you ever intended to, but you changed her for the better. She’s far more confident now, at least around other members of the club, and she isn’t such a shrinking violet when out in public.”

I shrugged, “Well it’s like you said, I wasn’t really trying to do that, it kind of happened by accident. And besides, I understand Minki, she’s just me but kinder and shorter. I’ve been through what she’s been through, and I know what I’ve done to manage my own issues. I wouldn’t even know where to begin with Andrew.”

“You mean you wouldn’t know how to help him address his crippling arrogance and self-importance? You have no idea what that’s like?”

I rolled my eyes, “Whether I know what that’s like or not is not the issue, the issue is whether I know how to get beyond that and become a better person. And obviously,” I laughed, “I have no idea how to do that.”

Victorina didn’t say anything in reply, but was quiet for a long moment, watching me intently, before she finally spoke, “How many generations back would I have to go to find one single person with royal or imperial blood in your family, Quinn?”

*Damn, well. The deception wasn’t going to last forever, now was it. And if anyone deserves to know the truth, it’s Victorina.*

I smiled, “Guess.”

“Hmm, well it’s awfully hard to tell,” she said, an almost predatory light in her eyes, “General awkwardness aside, once you get going you have the confidence to match the rank that you lay claim to. You speak to Diova, who’s next in line for one of the most powerful kingdoms in Elardia, as if he’s your equal. You didn’t seem any more put off by any of the royalty or nobility there, than you might be by someone in off the street. Everything except for the *way* you speak says that you are what you say you are. You speak with confidence, and in a way that makes it clear that you expect people to listen and appreciate what you have to say. And you’ve certainly got the arrogance to go along with the rank,” she noted with a smile, “I’d say that perhaps your great grand father held the rank you lay claim to, but that he was the last of your family to do so. Perhaps your branch of the family was not in the direct male line, and that now your family’s relation to the Canadian Emperor is at best a footnote, though the Angoves still hold some minor position in the realm.”

“Why does it need to be minor? Perhaps my father is one of the vassal Kings to the Emperor?”

She shook her head, “No, if your father was a King, then that is the rank you’d claim. No, your family has less absolute rank than that, but still has economic or political power out of proportion with their title. Perhaps your father is a Baron, but of one of the wealthiest cities in Canada. You mentioned Toronto I believe? Perhaps your father is the Baron of Toronto, and that Toronto is a city wealthy enough to rival even one of the realm’s Archdukes in terms of political and economic might.”

I smiled, “You’re pretty close, at least about the city. Toronto’s large enough that it actually has more people than all but two of Canada’s provinces, but no, my father was not the Baron of Toronto. Nah. He was, or I guess he still is, a university professor.”

“WHAT?” she exclaimed, slapping both hands down on the bench to either side of her.

“Yeah, you asked how many generations back you’d need to go before finding any imperial blood? It’s probably at least a couple dozen.”

“A couple dozen?” she breathed.

“Well you’ve got to consider the length of a human generation. Elves, especially since the rules have access to this life extension magic, live a long damn time. Combine that with the slow rate of procreation, and your generations are much longer. In particularly extreme cases, a human couple can produce a child every single year. Combine that with the shorter human life span, and a ‘generation’ means twenty to thirty years for a human. And while there’s a hell of a lot of humans, there’s still only so many potential parents out there. So go back far enough, about six hundred years, and I’m related to pretty much all the humans that lived then.”

“But…” Victorina trailed off, a little stunned.

“It’s powers of two,” I explained, “Two parents, four grandparents, eight great grandparents-“

“Sixteen great great grandparents, go back far enough, and you’ve got more relatives than people who were alive at the time,” she said, nodding along.

“Exactly.”

“And your family crest? What about that?”

“Oh, that’s real. Actually, the Angove family did hold land in Ireland. No idea how much or where, but I’m fairly sure that we got booted out by the English, which is part of the reason my ancestors ended up in Canada. Uh,” I hesitated, “How pissed off are you now?” I asked, more than a little guiltily.

She shook her head, more lost than anything. “I… You’re a commoner Quinn.”

“You say that like it’s a bad thing,” I replied.

“Isn’t it?” she challenged.

I was a little taken aback by this, I knew that Victorina was rather uncompromising when it came to magical talent and political rank, but I’d always thought of her fixation on rank as an extension of her desire for the best club members. Not that the ‘best’ meant noble, royal, or imperial, but that best meant educated, and in a world like this it was hard to have that education without the rank.

*I’ve been a little too naïve in this regard I think.*

“Every Canadian is a commoner,” I said quietly, “Every person from any western nation is a commoner. In fact, with only about a dozen exceptions in the whole world, every county on Earth either is, or at least claims to be, a democracy.”

“A democracy?” she said, expression sceptical, “What about that Queen you mentioned? What does she rule?”

“About fifty corgis? Her position is entirely ceremonial, she’s still got some theoretical power, but it’s much less than you might imagine. She’s the Queen of Canada, but the ruler, leader is probably a better word, the leader of Canada is our Prime Minister. The day to day running of the government is the responsibility of him, his cabinet, the rest of his party, and to some extent the other parties in the House of Commons. There are similar systems in other countries, and some of them don’t even have any sort of ceremonial monarch at all.”

“That… that doesn’t even make sense,” she said.

“I’m sorry I didn’t tell you sooner Victorina,” I said, but she didn’t seem to have much to say in reply.

I went back to watching the rain out the window, as did she, and we spent much of the rest of the journey in silence as I wondered if my admission had been enough to cause me to lose her respect.

That was of course, until I spotted someone running through the rain.

# Chapter 47

Quinn

-----

I went back to watching the rain out the window, as did she, and we spent much of the rest of the journey in silence as I wondered if my admission had been enough to cause me to lose her respect.

-----

That was of course, until I spotted someone running through the rain.

Not towards the carriage, no, that might have actually been preferable. No, it was the damned driver, running like hell down into the ditch that ran along the side of the road, and up into the woods.

“Victorina, if you have a shield spell cast it now!” I shouted, and there was the absolute briefest of pauses, before she brought her shield into being.

I had checked that my robe was closed at the front, and was just pulling my hood up when there was the sound of shattering pottery, and the windows on my side of the carriage were suddenly covered in a sheet of flame. I made for the opposite door, a spell already on my lips, but Victorina pushed me back into my seat.

“Me first,” she said, before speaking an incantation, which caused an orb of crackling electricity to form in each hand.

She threw herself against the door, and out the carriage, clearly planning on laying waste to whoever had decided to make the mistake of trying to ambush us. Of course, she was wearing heels, and had a hard enough time getting in and out of the carriage when I was helping her. Combine this with the speed at which the now spooked horses were now dragging the carriage, and I was sure that she was going to break both her ankles. She didn’t land on her feet though, and instead relied on the shield to cushion her fall, as she landed on her stomach and rolled out of sight.

I thought about staying for the briefest of moments, the fire wasn’t going to eat through the carriage that fast after all, but only for a moment. I threw myself from the carriage, doing my best to roll with the landing, rather than come down hard on my ankles. The landing was far from ideal, and I collected some bumps and scrapes as I tumbled, but I didn’t feel a shooting pain from any of my joints as I threw myself to my feet. I caught sight of the carriage as it thundered down the road towards the next bend. The whole right side of the carriage had been covered in fire, along with the horse on the same side, and I could smell the burnt horsehair as the animal screamed. The effect of the horses trying ineffectually to escape the fire, and the brightness of the fire blinding them, was to drive them blindly towards the left side of the road. Just as the road turned right. There was evidently a bit of a drop there, and the two horses stumbled as they left the road and fell, sliding and then tumbling, down the hill. The carriage followed quickly afterwards, before suddenly striking a couple of trees just a bit down the slope. I heard timbers and boards snapping as the carriage was suddenly jerked to a halt, before the horses started up their screaming again.

*Most of them are going to be by the bend in the road, but not all…*

I looked back down the path, though the now pouring rain, to see Victorina on the ground, lit only by her shield spell. Her dress was soaking wet and clung tightly to her body, and her hair was matted to her face. She was surrounded by several men, one of which had a knee planted on her chest. He trying to get a grip on her throat with one hand, while the other bludgeoned her repeatedly in the face with some sort of short club. In a somewhat ill-advised attempt to distract their attention, I pulled several stones up out of the gravel path with Apportation, picked the man furthest from Victorina’s place on the ground, and shouted the words that would cast MAC. The handful of rocks shot forwards in a shotgun like spray, and while I heard the distant *clink* of metal on stone I still saw him fall, so some must have caught the man where he was unarmoured.

Now if I’d been thinking I would have noticed that Victorina hadn’t lost the pair of Lighting Balls she’d been holding, and would have paid at least some attention to my own safety, since it seemed that she’d be able to see to her own defence in the short term. As it was, a moment after I killed the first man, Victorina let fly with both blasts of lighting. Her aim was awkward, due both to her position, and the man beating on her shield, but she still landed her shots. The man on top of her screamed and clutched at his chest as she drove her fist into it and fired point blank, while one of the others went down without a word, having been struck in the head. A moment after that, someone tried to cut my head off.

I felt something like a thin metal bar slam against the back of my head. The pain was blinding and I stumbled forwards, almost falling as my vision blurred and shifted. I kept myself on my feet though, and turned to see three vague grey shapes against the blackness of the night, each of them holding something short and gleaming. From their posture they all looked somewhat startled, especially the man closest to me, who had evidently just tried to hack the top of my head off. Some part of my brain noted down that it had been a good idea to have my formal robes armoured, along with the other sets of robes, but the rest of it was dedicated to casting Lightning Bolt. I launched two in quick succession, once from each hand. The first man let out a weak wheeze, before falling rigidly, his form briefly illuminated by a flash of light. The other screamed and thrashed wildly, and his agonized expression was also visible for just a moment as the lightning flashed, before he fell backwards.

The third man was particularly courageous, if a little imperceptive, and had gotten within my reach before I could get a third Lighting Bolt off. He was big for an elf, and thickly built, so when he did his best to run me through it still hurt like hell, even with the enchanted robes to protect me. I thought I felt something in my chest give a little as he struck me, and I was sure from the sudden shooting pain in my side that a rib had been cracked. The brute of an elf didn’t have time to think too hard about his mistake though, before I smacked him in the side of the head with one dead hand, just as I cast Lighting Ball. There was the sudden scent of ozone, burning flesh, and charred hair, and the man died with barely a sound. He too, I had a chance to see in detail thanks to the light cast by the spell, before he too fell to the ground. He hit the muddy road with a wet smack, like a butcher dropping a shank of meet on the counter, before falling still.

*Now that’s definitely gonna leave some psychological scars.*

I didn’t have time to think too much about just what I was doing, I don’t think I would have fought nearly as hard if I had, and instead I did what I could to force away the implications of just having killed four men in as many seconds. I did a quick scan of the trees to either side of the road, and back towards the bend where the carriage had gone over. It was damned hard to see, and it’s then that I realized the blurriness in my vision was *not* due to rain spattering my glasses. I’d lost them at some point, either in the leap from the carriage, or when I’d been struck in the back of the head. Granted, the blow to the head didn’t help with the whole clarity of vision thing, but the main issue was the missing glasses. I’d have no hope in hell of finding them in the dark like this, but thankfully I was prepared. My spare pair of glasses came flying out of a belt pouch to perch on my face a moment later, and I did another quick scan.

Even with them on, I couldn’t make out much of anything in the trees, and what I saw for movement could have just as easily been branches blown by the wind, as running men. There was a bit of flickring orange illumination coming from the carriage, but it was dying away. The oil fueling the fire was starting to get burned up, and the wood alone wouldn’t stay lit in a downpour like this. I considered casting Light for just a moment, before discarding the idea. The last thing I wanted was to provide any archers with an easier target, and I turned instead to Victorina, whose shield was still casting its own light. There would be more men coming up from where the carriage had crashed, most of the ambush party would have been waiting there, but I needed to deal with the immediate threat first.

I started sprinting back up the road towards her, and despite the danger of imminent death some part of my hindbrain still took a moment to take notice of the way that her soaked dress clung to her as she fought. The sodden silk left little to the imagination as it outlined every curve, with the light cast from the shield only serving to further emphasize the effect. There were perhaps five crumpled bodies lying in the mud around her, with six more standing men. They hell-bent on bludgeoning her into submission, and were striking fast and quick with their short clubs. She was not very cooperative though, and had already risen to her feet. She’d kicked off or lost one of her shoes, though the other was still in place, and so she stood awkwardly as she fended off blow after blow, and loosed her spells.

Finally given a chance to breathe, I drew several lead sling stones from my pouch as I ran towards the group. The shape of a sling stone wasn’t quite as ideal as a purpose made bullet, like one that might be fired from a rifle, but they were better than a simple lead ball when it came to aerodynamics. I hesitated though, unable to shoot for fear of hitting Victorina. Now that she’d gotten to her feet and the men had clustered around her, I’d risk hitting her if I fired. Her shield could probably handle it, but for all I knew that would be what finally brought it down. The men around her knew what they were doing, trying to overwhelm the shield and drain Victorina’s mana with rapid blows, and the last thing she needed was me adding to the burden. This was not a shot to make when I could barely see my targets.

She was casting Firebolt and Lightning Bolt as quickly as she could, but it seemed to be of limited effect. Either she was really running low on mana and was casting only what she could do for free, or the men’s armour was enough to afford some protection against her spells. At worst it might have even been both. MAC of course would have torn right through leather, bronze, or even steel armour, even at its lowest level of energy, but it had a flaw. Even the Bolt version of the spell required that the caster have a projectile on hand, and even with the shield up she wasn’t going to be able to pull one from a pocket or spot one on the ground with those men so close.

I had covered about half the distance between our respective carriage disembarkation points when my line of fire was suddenly cleared, in the worst possible way. Victorina’s shield had finally collapsed, and one of the men drove his club into her gut. She let out a pained sound that was somewhere between a gasp and a whimper as the air was driven out of her lungs, and she doubled over in pain, just as another man brought his club down on the back of her head. She crumpled, going limp, and went down in a heap.

“MOTHERFUCKER,” I screamed, as I raised both arms and skidded to a halt.

I didn’t bother with accurate shooting, and just packed every one of the sling stones I’d drawn out into a single casting of the spell. The shotgun-like blast from the MAC spell hit the first of the two men to strike Victorina, and turned his chest into a bloody ruin. I drew more sling stones out, and cast the spell as quickly as I could manage. The effect was like a constant stream of fire from a machinegun, as the almond shaped lead weights streamed lazily from the pouch, before suddenly being accelerated with a pulse of magical power. Caught out on the road like that, with no cover and no way to shoot back, they had no hope. I drew my aim across them as they tried to scatter, running for the trees, but none of them made it even as far as the edge of the road.

It was not an instant after I lowered my arm and stopped the stream of lead, that I suddenly took fire from both sides of the road. They’d evidently been more preoccupied with Victorina’s little battle, and had been too distracted to notice that the first three men I’d killed had been unable to subdue me themselves. Some missed, a product of the darkness, rain, or the speed at which they switched targets, but some of the arrows struck home. Again, the blows hurt like hell, but again my robes were enough to fend off the worst of it. Rather than try to watch for the shots coming ahead of time, which was damned near impossible, I ducked my head and ran for Victorina, trusting in the thin hood to keep me from getting a bolt through the noggin. Victorina, thankfully, was already stirring as I stomped through the mud to reach her.

“We really need to go!” I shouted over the rain, as I did my best to help her up with my useless hands “Come on!”

I spared a glance back down the road, the fire from the carriage well and truly out now, and was disappointed to see that the team by the carriage had been clever enough to get into the trees once they saw what I could do. Not being able to see them wasn’t about to stop me though, and I started up the spell again as I drew the stream of lead into the trees on both sides of the road. Wood cracked, rocks shattered, and sprays of dirt and mud went up wherever the shots landed, and I did what I could to keep our enemies from sticking their heads out while I tried shake Victorina wholly awake. I was worried for a moment that I’d need to carry her, but she was one tough bitch. In only a moment she had grabbed hold of my shoulder and was hauling herself up, while she used the other hand cast some sort of healing spell on herself.

“Mothersarding sons of sarding whores!” she shouted as she loosed a Fire Bolt at the nearest tree that most closely resembled a man.

She kicked off the remaining fancy shoe, and I got her moving towards the city as I supported her. She was rather unsteady on her feet, as a violent blow to the head is wont to do, but thankfully we took no more arrow fire. I was thankful for that, hopefully my ***suppressing fire*** had been enough to scare the living daylights out of whatever sons of bitches had ambushed us. I might have been able to cover one side of Victorina with my body, but that was about it. We were perhaps fifty metres down the road, about where the carriage had gone off, when Victorina finally regained her balance and set to running on her own. It was far from ideal though, her in bare feet, me in what were essentially dress shoes, running down a road that was quickly turning to mud. Even if neither of us turned an ankle, I was still concerned by the level of endurance that most elves showed. We were at least another fifteen minutes by carriage from the city, more than double that on foot, and I really didn’t think that Victorina could keep things up that long.

I felt an arrow strike me in the back as I ran, but I barely noticed the pain as I turned in terror to see if Victorina had also been hit. She looked like an absolute wreck, but there was no shaft of wood protruding from her back to add to the mess. Her hair was matted down to the back of her head and neck with blood and water, and more blood trickled down her face, only to be washed away by the pouring rain. Her dress was torn in several places, and it was only due to its poor state that she was afforded enough room to run in what at one point might have been a formal ball gown.

Another arrow struck me in the back as I ran, and another, until finally, it had been bound to happen, one struck me in the calf. That was one problem with picking robes that were more practical. I had plenty of room to move, but anything south of my knees was entirely unprotected. I screamed as the arrow struck home, stumbled as I tried to put weight on the now bad leg, and hit the ground hard. Victorina glanced to the side as I let out the not at all girlish scream, and skidded to a stop as she saw me go down. She got turned around, and covered the few paces back to me before throwing herself to her knees beside me. Judging from her expression, the wound was not minor, and I turned as best I could to check the damage. There was about a foot of splintered wood sticking out of the back of my right calf, and canted off to one side, the rest of the arrow had evidently been broken off as I’d fallen. Part of the arrow getting snapped off hadn’t been gentle on my leg, and in addition to the large hole where the arrow head had gone in, I could see a tear in the flesh of my leg.

“Sard, sard, sard,” Victorina was saying under her breath, as she looked between the wound in my leg, and the road behind us.

I couldn’t see the men pursuing us, they were smart enough to stay out of sight after my stunt with MAC, but they had to be close. They’d been trying not to shoot Victorina while also getting around my armour, and for a shot like that, on a running target through the rain in the dark, they had to be close.

“Victorina,” I said, as calmly as possible, though the pain was evident in my voice, “I don’t suppose you could cast teleport and get us the hell out of here?”

“I don’t have the mana, I used it all on that stupid shield,” she hissed, “And even if I did, it’s not going to get us to the city.”

“Sorry,” I said, “Seemed like a-“

“That’s not what I meant,” she said, half rushed, half apologetic, “Oh sard, this is not good.”

“Any place is better than here,” I said, getting more ammunition ready.

I only had so much left and had gone through it surprisingly quickly when I’d done my best impression of a medium machine gun. I’d kept what I’d thought was a lot in one of my pouches, but casting as quickly as I was able had used a pound of ammo almost every five seconds.

“Give me your hand,” she said, “Have you got much enervation left?”

“Plenty,” I gasped, taking her offered hand, “Was expecting to use most of it to run away, so I’ve still got most of it.”

“Well you’re going to provide the energy, and I’m going to cast the spell, okay?” She asked, voice wavering only a little, “Can you do that?”

*Fuck if I know.*

“Yes,” I said with conviction.

“I’m going to do this quick and dirty,” she said,” So brace yourself, this isn’t going to be fun.”

*Still better than any date I went on in highschool.*

I heard the crunch of gravel to one side and I twisted, still lying on my belly on the ground, to look past Victorina to see several more of the men. Two were just leaving the tree line and running down into the ditch the lined the road, while another was already taking his first steps towards Victorina. I cast MAC as quickly as I could, and took the man in the forehead just as he lifted his club, which actually looked more like a weighted sock, to strike Victorina. The other two men were just scrambling out of the water filled trough, as Victorina finished her spell.

-----

There was a sudden but mild pang of nausea, and a larger wave of fatigue, as we flitted from one place to another and we suddenly found ourselves in different, and if possible, even darker part of the forest. Victorina let go of my hand, and scrambled away from me quickly, before she immediately started vomiting *extremely* violently. I could barely make out her form in the near absolute darkness, which was probably for the best. The sounds she was making were rather undignified, and she probably didn’t want me to have a very good look at her right now. All the food and wine she’d had at the banquet was coming back up, and the accompanying sounds made me concerned that most of her lower intestine would also be joining the remains of her meal on the forest floor.

She got herself back under control a moment later, and what little light there was flashed dimly off of a bare arm as she wiped at her mouth. She put her face in her hands, for just a moment, before steeling herself and straightening her back. She twisted around on the grass, thankfully not mud, since I was more or less face down in it, and cast Light. She kept it dim and low to the ground, as she used it to look over my wound.

“It’s going to be alright Quinn, I promise,” she said solemnly, “And I think it’s perfectly fine that you’re a commoner.”

*That sounds like the sort of thing you’d say in apology to reassure someone that’s about to die, I’m not about to die, am I?*

I turned my head, painfully, due to the previous sword blow, to double check the wound. It was awfully bad, but not the imminent death sort of bad.

“I’m going to pull out the arrowhead,” she said, taking a deep breath, “It’s going to hurt a lot, but once I do I should be able to heal this, as good as new. Okay?”

“Okay, I trust you Victorina,” I reassured her.

This was evidently the sort of thing that she wanted to hear, and she nodded confidently, “On three," she said, grasping the shaft firmly.”

*She’s gonna do it on two.*

“One… Two…” and then she yanked swiftly and strongly on the arrowhead, drawing it out of my leg.

It hurt worse coming out than going in, now that my adrenaline wasn’t pumping quite so hard, but I took some small consolation in my genre savviness as I did my best not to make any pitiful sounds.

“Do you have more enervation to spare?” She asked, as she was casting the spell, and I nodded weakly, not trusting myself to speak.

She cast the spell and finally the pain faded away. Not just from my leg, but also the lesser pains that I’d felt in my ribs and back, pains that I’d barely noticed until they were absent. There was another wave of exhaustion, which added to the already expended enervation, the short lived run, and the late hour, but even then I barely noticed it. It was nothing compared to my relief as the blanket of pain was lifted off of my body.

I rolled over onto my back, and then sat up to face Victorina, “You look fucking awful,” I said flatly.

“You look worse,” she said, exhaustion evident in her voice, “Even after the healing.”

“What about you, I saw you cast something on yourself when I first picked you up, was that enough?”

“Not really,” she said, and I noticed that she was shivering violently “I’ll manage for now, but we’ll both need more once we get back to the clubhouse.”

“Right,” I said, as I looked through belt pouches in an attempt to find what I was looking for, “Can you get us the rest of the way there?”

“With teleport?” She shook her head, “Maybe if I had time to recover my mana, but we don’t have the time. I didn’t throw us that far. They won’t know which way to look, but we’re probably less than a mile from where I cast the spell.”

I grimaced, “That might be enough of a head start for us to make it back on foot, maybe.”

“Quinn,” Victorina said, her teeth clacking together, “I can’t make that walk, I just… can’t. I’m sorry, I can b-b-b-barely stand, and I’m freezing.”

I took a moment to think, running through my options, and what I had in the belt pouches and Portable Hole. We could try hiding somewhere close by, and wait out the night, but they’d notice the mess Victorina made when we’d landed. They’d know we popped through right here, and would also know that they didn’t need to look too far. We might try waiting in ambush, and try to kill the rest of them, but that was dicey. We wouldn’t have much time to prepare the ground, and Victorina was getting worse and worse.

“Sard. I’m sorry Quinn, this is my damned fault. I might not have recognized those men, but they were here for me. They could have killed me when the shield dropped, and they *did* try to kill you, but they didn’t try to kill me. Probably men sent-“

“Hey,” I interrupted, “This is my fault remember? Don’t you take that away from me. I’m the one who set off this whole Adympian succession crisis bullshit, don’t you try to take credit for that. Think of it, a simple commoner like me, having such an impact on the world stage. Who would have thought that such a simple man cou-“

She swatted me weakly, “Simple is damned right, fine, we’re both equally to blame. Now how the hell do we get out of this alive and unkidnapped? You’ve got a kitchen sink in that Extra Dimensional Handkerchief, is there anything actually useful in there?”

“Hey, don’t you bad mouth my kitchen appliances, they’re plenty useful. Maybe I’ll shove you in there if you’re not careful,” I said, *wait… fuck… god dammit,* “Actually…”

“What? You’re serious?” she asked.

“Why not? I’ve got blankets, fresh clothes, even some more healing supplies. You get in there, get warm, dry, and healed up. It’s going to be a right bitch, but if I set out now I can get us back to the club house before they get a very good idea of where we are.”

“A-a-a-alright,” she shivered, “Open the stupid thing up before I freeze to death. And don’t get lost while you’re carrying me around, the city is directly to the north, and we’re on the west side of the road.”

I already had the Portable Hole to hand, and spread it out on the grass. I helped Victorina in gently, before pointing out the supplies she’d need, and finally folding it back up. Shrouded in darkness now that her Light spell had run its course, I stood up and broke into a slow jog. I stayed to the clearer areas of the forest, rather than where I might find the most cover. I had a head start, which meant that my time was much better spent making the most use of it, rather than creeping around slowly. If I got far enough in the first couple minutes I wouldn’t need to contend with the ambushers at all, having left them behind. I was already tired, but I’d pushed myself harder before, and I was pretty sure that I could still outmatch an elf when it came to long distance running. No, there were two, well three, possible problems that I’d need to deal with, but none were the ambushers. First was that I needed to avoid tripping, falling, and twisting an ankle. Hence my decision to stick to more open areas. Second, the ambushers might have the odd scout spread out around the ambush area. The scouts, if they were there, had probably been placed to signal our approach or to call out if witnesses were on the way, but they’d also be there to try to catch any escapees. The third possible problem was the front gate. Depending on how much reach these guys had, they might have subverted the guards there. It didn’t even take some deep cover infiltration, they might just have knocked the usual guards over the head, and then taken their uniforms.

There were multiple gates though, and I hoped that whatever resources the ambushers had, they could really only afford to do that at one gate, if they did it at all. So rather than head for the closest one, the one we’d left through originally, I went for the one on the west side of the city. It was a couple miles extra, but I’d rather run two or three more miles than risk getting surprised at the gate.

My flight from the ambush, heroically carrying the princess to safety, turned out to be incredibly boring.

I didn’t run into anyone waiting for stragglers from the ambush, and the ammunition that I’d held ready went unused. It took over an hour, but I eventually made it to the western gate. Even that was boring. I’d been expecting at least some sort of challenge, a man in formal Mage robes dragging himself up out of the ditch and onto the road in front of the gate and all, that seemed like the sort of thing that would raise suspicion. But no, there was some initial confusion, but then they recognized the robes as Mage robes and waved me through as if this sort of thing happened all the time.

*What the hell kinda shenanigans do other Mages get up to?*

Once in the city I had no trouble getting the rest of the way to the University, and then to the clubhouse. There were few people out on the road in weather like this and the rain had washed away any trace of the fight so I just looked like another sodden, if exhausted, traveler.

I came round the corner to see someone standing in front of the clubhouse, and I went very still, ready to snap off a quick shot if necessary, before I realized that it was Lili waiting there for me. I entertained the idea of her being a double agent for a moment, before discarding it as being a touch too paranoid. She spotted me as I approached, and ran to meet me half way.

“Quinn! I am so glad you’re alright, but where in the name of all that is good is Victorina?” She asked, grasping me by the arms and looking up at me with a slightly wild look.

I pulled the Portable Hole out of my pocket, “In here,” I explained, “How did you know we were in trouble?”

“There was another carriage not too far behind yours, they ran into the ambushers as they were trying to carry off the bodies of their friends,” she explained, as we headed for the shelter of the clubhouse, “There was a bit of a tussle, but they got word back to the League guildhall. The League got word to the University, and we got people out searching the woods around the crash as quickly as possible. We chased off or killed most of the Adympians, but we didn’t capture any alive, and we had no idea where you were.”

I pushed open the door to the clubhouse, and nearly fell through it, “Victorina teleported us a ways off, and then I started running. I was probably clear of the immediate area by the time anyone else had heard what happened.”

“Well I’m just glad you’re al-, Quinn,” she interrupted herself, “You look awful!”

“I *feel* awful,” I replied, as I sat down heavily on the floor and spread out the Portable Hole, “Jumping from the moving carriage was the easy part, compared to everything else.”

Victorina looked to be in much better shape after having had a chance to rest, eat, and heal. She barely even needed my help as she clambered out of the hole, which was good, because I was barely able to give it.

“A kitchen, camping supplies, and most of a hospital in there, but no ladder?” Victorina asked once she was out of it, and standing next to me.

“I’ll put it on the list,” I said tiredly, from my spot on the floor.

“You look awful,” Victorina said, as much sympathetic as she was amused.

I nodded, “Lili mentioned that, yeah.”

“I’ve already drawn a bath in your room Quinn, go get washed up and get some rest. Victorina can tell me what’s happened,” Lili said.

“That sounds like a fantastic idea,” I replied, and Victorina helped me as I rose unsteadily to my feet.

-----

I practically fell into the bathtub, which was blessedly hot, and I relaxed back into it. I let out a pleased sigh as I enjoyed the fact that I was no longer cold and soaking wet. Well… Okay, I was wet, obviously, I was in the bath. I wasn’t wearing wet clothes though, and that was the important thing.

*I need two new spells. Actually, I need a lot of new spells, but two come to mind. First, I need a purpose built contact version of the Lighting and Fire spells. If I’ve got to fight up close again, like I did tonight, they’re going to come in handy. Victorina and I both ended up using projectile spells point blank, but I bet they’d have even more power if no energy was used to launch the bolt. Second, I need a continuous version of MAC, so I don’t need to keep chanting to keep the rate of fire up.*

I pulled some of the medical supplies out of my belt, healing salves and potions mostly, and used them to tend to my wounds as I relaxed in the tub.

*Other spells… I need to learn Teleport, not knowing that has been a significant oversight on my part. I can probably get much more use out of it than any elf. I can afford to cast it faster, and I’ve got way more energy, which should translate to longer distances if I understand things right. We could have avoided much or all of that mess if I’d known Teleport. I’d never be able to forgive myself if Victorina had gotten carried off because I hadn’t known the right spell, and we were fucking close to that actually happening. So, Teleport. Probably the jumpy-leapy spells that Halea and Diova use as well.*

*And continuing with the theme of bad things happening because I don’t know the right spells, I need some healing magic as soon as possible. I’ve enrolled in classes for that at least. I also need to step my game up, and figure out how the hell to lift the curse. The clubhouse has some beefy defences, but there’s only so much they can protect against. If Victorina’s enemies are brazen enough to try to snatch her up after a University function, then they’re pretty determined. Fuck, that was the first thing they tried, what the hell is the next attempt going to look like?*

*Lifting the curse, I need healing magic for that, and I need a stasis enchantment, ideally the original. That means breaking into the restricted section of the Library. Breaking into the Library means figuring out how it’s defended. Once I’m in, I photograph the shit out of anything remotely useful with the phone. Assuming I can get it charged, I should be able to try that tomorrow morning though. I might also find the rest of what I need in the restricted section as well…*

------

I must have dozed off at some point, because I was startled awake by the latch on the bathroom door clicking open. I’d obviously been lying there for a while, because the water in the tub was freezing cold. Victorina pushed the door open slowly, and god damn, she looked stunning. She was all dressed up, as she had been when I’d first seen her before the ball, but minus the dress. Her hair was absolutely perfect, a sheet of molten steel. She still wore her highly heeled shoes, and they made her hips sway as she walked. Her sheer stockings were held up by a lacy black garter belt, and she still wore the corset that Thera had so much fun tying. It, like the rest of her underwear, was also very black, and very lacy. No witty comment came to mind as she stalked towards me and sat down on the edge of the tub.

She reached down, and traced a finger along the line of my jaw and down to my neck, “You know,” she said, eyes ablaze, “I’ve wanted to do this for *ages*.”

“Yeah?” I said, rather dumbly.

“Yes,” she snarled, wrapping one vice like hand around my neck, “You useless fucking lowborn dog.”

She forced my head under the water with an unreal strength, and I thrashed around as I tried to get free.

*Water,* ***again*** *this is just getting old.*

As calm as I was trying to remain though, I was screwed, on multiple different unfun levels. My hands didn’t work, which meant that I had to cast spells by incantation. My head was under the water, which meant that I couldn’t speak the incantation. And since my hands didn’t work, I really had no way to apply leverage to lift myself up out of the tub. I couldn’t grab the sides and pull myself up, and trying to force Victoria off of me was doing absolutely nothing at all. With my hands as useless as they were, I might not have even been pushing against her, and I’d never know. I just didn’t have the strength, and whatever endurance I did have had been exhausted. Besides, outlasting her wasn’t really an option. I was going to run out of breath before she ran out of strength.

Suddenly the crushing force on my neck was torn away and I came up spluttering, to see Victorina thrown against one wall by… another Victorina. Rather than being dressed to kill, *heh, dressed to kill,* she wore only my hoodie. It was the original one that I’d been wearing when I’d first arrived, maybe the only cotton garment on the whole planet. She’d needed to roll up the sleeves since they were nearly a foot too long for her arms, and it was long enough in the body to fall to her knees, though the rest of her legs were bare. Her hair hadn’t been done up with nearly as much effort as Sexy Victorina’s was, and instead she looked like she’d just gotten out of the bath herself. She cast Lightning Bolt, and there was a deafening crack of thunder in the small room as Sexy Victorina was struck by the bolt. There was no smell of burnt hair and charred hair though, and she instead turned into a cloud of curling mist, disturbed only by the passage of the Lighting Bolt.

“Quinn,” Wholesome Victorina said, “Wake up you dolt.”

# Chapter 48

Victorina

-----

Waking up in Quinn’s arms was a particularly enjoyable experience, and I decided that I’d need to start doing it much more frequently in the future. I could hear the hush of rain falling against the cobblestones outside, and Quinn’s slow and steady breathing as I lay against him. I could smell the slightly salty scent of Quinn’s skin, and the earthy and damp smell of rain as it wafted in through the slightly open windows. I could feel the almost feverish heat of Quinn’s body as I was pressed against him and wrapped up in the thick blankets, and the cold air of the rest of the room as it just kissed the tips of my ears as they poked up out of the blankets. I could see only Quinn’s toned but slim form as it was wrapped around me, lit just a little by a sun that hadn’t quite made it over the horizon.

I lay there quietly, not wanting to wake him. I knew that humans usually needed a extra hour or so of sleep than elves, and I was perfectly willing to lie there and enjoy the closeness of Quinn’s body while he slept on. I’d explained the events of last night to Lili, and she had promised to handle all the questions that would invariably be asked about last night. She’d insisted that we both needed time to relax, and I wasn’t about to disagree with her. I had a pretty good idea of what Quinn would think about so many people asking so many questions, and so I was perfectly happy to take Lili up on her offer. We’d both have classes starting tomorrow, but the University was already very flexible about scheduling, and no one would think it odd if we took a few extra days to recover. Besides, the first week or so of classes was rarely much more than an extended introduction and some basic orientation.

I did manage to find a way to ruin my enjoyment of the experience though, and while basking in the warmth of Quinn’s presence, I found my mind drawn to thoughts of what might have been. If Quinn had been a touch less courageous, if I’d had a Mishap when casting the Teleport spell, or if one of us had been injured more seriously… I would have been captured, Quinn would have been killed out of hand, and I would have been slapped in a slave collar and abused daily until whoever captured me finally got the heir they wanted. It wouldn’t be quick either. It might take years for me to produce a child, and gods forbid if the first child was female.

And Quinn… Quinn had already been though something of what I’d narrowly escaped. Maybe not to the same vile extremes, and certainly not for anywhere near the amount of time that I might have been subject to such treatment, but he had been through it. I’d already been doing my best not to dwell too much on thoughts of what Lady Chypia might have done with him while he was in her hands, but that was before I’d ever had any thoughts of taking him for myself. Now though I couldn’t help but wonder what had Chypia done with Quinn, before he’d become mine.

He seemed able to endure it though, and I thought of the first day I’d met him, when Lili had introduced him to us. He’d been free barely more than a day, but was already on his feet and moving on. And here I was, stressing over what might have been, when Quinn was able to actually go through it, and then brush it off with barely a second thought.

I lifted a hand to his chest and saw for the first time, now that the sun had risen a little higher, than the entirety of Quinn’s chest was just one massive and livid bruise. I hadn’t noticed last night, but relying on his enchanted robes to keep him alive hadn’t left him uninjured. I traced my hands across his chest, amazed at how much he’d endured last night. Even with the enchantment this sort of punishment would have been more than enough stop any elf from doing much more than trying to hide and hope no one noticed them. But Quinn didn’t hide, he endured what must have been the fastest and least graceful Teleportation ever, got just enough healing to keep him going, and then spent an hour trekking through the woods to get me to safety, while *I* hid. I’d been hiding inside his Extra Dimensional Handkerchief, huddled in a pile of his spare clothing, all but helpless while he carried me to safety.

Oh gods, the Teleport, what must he have thought? I’d already been soaked to the skin before ever casting the spell, and I didn’t imagine that the wet silk had left much to his imagination. Then I’d made it even worse when I failed to keep myself under control after the Teleport. He’d managed it with little difficulty, but there I was, on all fours in the mud, and making the most humiliating sounds.

I’d just been thinking about how badly I needed this, of how long it had been since I’d had anything more than a friend, and how Quinn seemed perfect. But I realized just how far ahead of myself I was getting. Less than a day ago the two of us had just been friends, and now here I was fawning over him.

*You’re not some foolish girl that falls at the feet of the first man to treat her like an elf and not a piece of meat. Quinn is a lovely man, but don’t you go and scare him off by falling too hard for him.*

-----

Quinn stirred a little later, shifting in the bed as he woke.

“Good morning beautiful,” he murmured sleepily.

“Flattery will get you nowhere,” I said, and I was reminded of the results of my post-teleportation sickness last night, “Sleep well?”

“Yeah,” he said, rubbing the sleep from his eyes, “I feel awfully sore th- Hey, are you alright Victorina?“ He asked, looking down at me.

I lifted my fingers to my face, and found a little wetness on my cheeks, “It’s fine, I’m fine, I’ve just had some time to think about what might have happened if things had gone differently,” I said, and I was betrayed again by my emotions as more tears came.

It wasn’t as if I’d started bawling my eyes out, but a few traitorous tears had trickled down my cheeks.

*You’re supposed to be stronger than this Victorina. No general starts crying before his men when things get a little stressful, the others expect more from you.*

I gritted my teeth and shook my head to clear my vision, “Enough of that,” I said, reaching down to slip Quinn’s light silk trousers from his waist, “I think I was fairly clear about how you’d be showing me your gratitude for me having saved your life.”

“Whoa whoa whoa Victorina,” Quinn said, as he wrapped me up in a tight hug, pinning my arms to my sides, “Let’s not get too hasty. If that’s the sort of thing that’s been foremost on your mind, then I don’t really think that it’s the best idea for the two of us to be in a rush to tear each other’s clothes off immediately afterwards.”

“I’m already quite naked,” I told him, a little frustrated, and a little hurt, “And you seemed perfectly fine with the idea last night.”

“Well, yes. You are smoking hot after all,” he replied, and while I wasn’t sure what ‘smoking hot’ meant, it did sound complimentary, “But I don’t want to rush this. I think you’re pretty fantastic Victorina, and I’d like something more than purely physical relationship. Maybe I’m being a little presumptuous here, but I’d like to think that you feel the same. I’d like to still be doing this a year from now, instead of burning out after a month, maybe it would be best if we took things slow.”

*A purely physical relationship, like the one you had with Thera. There’s another woman that’s had you before me.*

“You’re right,” I said quietly, as I relaxed in his arms, “Don’t you think you’re going to get away with that for long though, I’ll get you eventually.”

“I don’t doubt it,” he chuckled.

“Now let go of me and shut up so I can tend to your injuries,” I commanded, “You’re an absolute mess, and what about this scar? How did you get this?”

He let me go, and I sat up in bed, pulling a sheet up to my chest to cover myself.

“Knife fight,” he explained, “I was a little underprepared though, and forgot to bring my knife.”

“Did you win?” I asked, as I snatched up his belt from where it rested on the nightstand.

I had more than enough magic, of course, to heal the wounds that way, but I decided against it. I liked the idea of the salve, and slowly rubbing it onto his chest and back. It wasn’t quite to the level of what I’d wanted from him, but it was more intimate than muttering a word to make it all better.

“You’re going to have some trouble doing that one handed,” he noted, as I tried to unscrew the lid of the jar with one hand, while holding the sheet to my chest with the other.

I swallowed, “Is the *commoner* expecting the *princess* to bare her body for him, so that he might entertain himself? You are awfully immodest.”

“Was what you told me last night modest?” he asked, with eyebrows raised, “I’m pretty sure that was kinda far from immodest. Besides, I haven’t even got my glasses on, I can barely make you out.”

I narrowed my eyes at him, “Is that so?”

He shrugged, “Mostly.”

I bit my lip, unsure. I knew exactly what Halea or Thera would do of course, they wielded their beauty like a knife, but then I didn’t really want to remind Quinn of Thera. I didn’t mind the idea of him appreciating me a little though…

“Close your eyes,” I instructed, and he raised an eyebrow, “Do it you common dog, I command it.”

“Well excuuuse me, princess,” he said with a smile, before laying back and closing his eyes.

I let the sheet fall away, *let him peek,* and pulled myself on top of him to straddle him so that I could set to massaging the salve into his chest. I took my time, careful to be gentle at first while the salve was still working to heal the damage, and only being more firm after the bruising had been healed.

“I’m pretty sure those are healed by now Victorina,” Quinn said, without opening his eyes, “How is it any sort of fair for you to play with mine so much, when you won’t even let me look at yours?”

“Your princess commands you to be silent,” I said haughtily, “Now roll over so I can do your back.”

“As you wish,” he said, though he seemed to find something funny about this remark as well, and he rolled over.

I particularly enjoyed the sounds he made as I tended to his back, the muffled groans as I healed the bruises and worked out the knots in his muscles.

“How can you stand this Quinn?” I asked, as I attacked on particularly bunched up knot in one shoulder “You must have felt terribly sore.”

“Just used to it I guess. Knees and back aching are one of the few downsides to being so tall.”

“Well,” I said, leaning down by his ear, my breasts pressing against his back, “If it ever becomes too much for you, your princess will tend to your aches and pains. That is, so long as you’ve been humble enough in your grovelling.”

“You’ve gone beyond simply accepting my less than noble heritage, I think, and now seem to be taking pleasure in it,” he remarked.

“Well it’s only fair. Even the club leaders that are very particular about their members having noble blood will usually invite at least one particularly pretty commoner to join their ranks so that they’ve got *someone* to entertain themselves with. If other nobles can take advantage of the common folk to satiate their desires, then it’s only fair if I can do the same. Mmm, I’ve been spending an awful lot of time with Thera, and she’s been telling me all sorts of things about what she does with Abis. It’s given me some ideas about just *how* you should be kneeling before me,” I said, grinding my hips into his back.

I finished up on his back, banishing the last of the bruising and even softening the scar, before I finally slid off of him. I picked up his hooded jumper from where it had fallen the night before, and slipped into it.

“Now,” I said sternly, trying to keep the smile from my voice, “I’m going to go hop in the tub, and when I get out I expect a breakfast befitting a princess.”

“Really?” he asked, just before I was hauled off my feet and thrown back onto the bed by an invisible force, “Because I don’t think you’re quite done here yet.”

I landed with a soft thump, and my breath caught in my throat as he pressed me down with one forearm. I waited with anticipation for the clothes to be torn from my body, for him to throw himself down on top of me, and for him to have his way with me. I didn’t quite get what I wanted, but it was enough to tide me over for the time being. He leaned down, and kissed me gently on the lips.

I honestly could not remember the last time that anyone had done that, the last time that I’d been able to *let* anyone kiss me, it had been years.

I found his gentleness sweet, but ultimately insufficient, and I wrapped my arms around his neck and drew him down into me. I so badly wanted him to kick off the silk trousers, so that I might wrap my legs around him as well, but he found the self-control somewhere to do no more than kiss me. At some point I managed to get atop him, straddling him again as I finally let all the stress and frustration of being alone all this time flow out of me in that kiss.

Finally I managed to pull myself away, and I rolled off of him. I caught my breath as I lay beside him, breathing hard, and so dizzy that I saw stars, but finally feeling genuinely good about myself for the first time in ages. I’d always had the magic, the skill, and the experience, but I’d always been envious of Halea and Thera, who could seemingly conjure handsome men out of thin air.

I got out bed finally, intent on getting that bath, when Quinn slapped my bottom, “Now you can go,” he said, and I turned with a fury to see him grinning at me from his place on the bed.

I leapt onto him, intent on beating some respect into him. I ended up trying to kiss some respect into him instead, and while it didn’t work, I certainly enjoyed the attempt.

-----

Quinn, to his credit, did make me breakfast. It was still just the two of us in the clubhouse, and it felt very special for Quinn to be cooking for me. Of course, he’d done that before, but then it had been for everyone in the club, not just me alone. Lili had said that the other girls had stayed with their families overnight, for fear that they’d be targeted as well. Of course, this was nonsense. Instead it was simply a case of their parents wanting to take advantage of the opportunity to keep their daughters within their control for a bit longer. They wanted to know exactly what their girls were up to at the University, the extra day would give them the chance to get more than the vague comments that they would have been able to squeeze out of their daughters in the scant hours before the ball. Brandy and Thera of course weren’t so unfortunate as to be facing such an interrogation, and instead were probably both sleeping off the effects of last night’s festivities.

With nothing to do today I resolved to spend the day with Quinn. Minki had always been the one that he’d shared most of his experiments and new inventions with, but I’d come to the decision that the best way to get to know Quinn, would be by accompanying him as he worked. Quinn had an odd sort of work ethic, and he seemed to alternate between working with an almost psychotic passion, and abject laziness, with seemingly no discernible pattern. It wasn’t just how hard he worked either, it was also a matter of what he worked on. One moment he’d be throwing himself into a problem, at the expense of sleep or regular meals, and in another he’d be casting it aside for something he found more interesting. Sometimes he’d come back to the problem after discarding it as uninteresting, as he had with his hands, but not always. I liked the idea of being the subject of such passion, but Quinn would get bored with everything eventually.

The current subject of Quinn’s passion was a small, cracked, slab of glass. He’d said that it was a phone. Unless it was an android, or a telephone, or a Samsung, or a smart phone. He was irritatingly inconsistent in his explanations, but whatever he called it, the device supposedly contained a significant amount of Earth knowledge. Unfortunately I wasn’t familiar with the notes he’d written, or the spells that he was planning to use, so I mostly just sat with his arm around me as I watched him work.

“Do you want me to fix that crack for you?” I asked him, once he’d gotten the thing working, “It’s shouldn’t be too hard.”

“Sure,” he said handing it to me, though he seemed a little distracted by something.

A simple casting of Repair later, and the piece of glass that Quinn called a ‘screen’ was no longer cracked.

“Here you are,” I said, as I handed it back to Quinn.

He said nothing in reply as he took it, and instead looked down at the floor, seeming to consider something.

“What is it Quinn,” I asked, as I ran one hand down his back.

He took a deep breath before asking, “You want to raise that curse still, right?”

“Yes,” I nodded, “Are you having second thoughts? It’s alright if you are Quinn, you already bought us a full year to find a different solution, and even after that we’ve still got reserves of cash that will last another year at least. You don’t need to rush off to try something so dangerous.”

“Well that’s the thing, I’m not having second thoughts. I think I’ve actually got a fairly clear idea of just how to do it, and not in a couple of years, but a couple of months,” he explained.

“What’s the problem then?”

“Doing it is probably going to involve breaking several of the University’s rules. I just thought that I should let you know.”

I shrugged, “Even going into the guild hall at all would technically be breaking the rules Quinn, but people do that all the time. It’s only when someone gets hurt that they really pay much attention to that rule. They’re not going to care if you had to bend the rules to lift the curse. They already look the other way most of the time anyways.”

“That’s the thing though, I’m not bending the rules, or doing something that they’re likely to overlook. To lift the curse I’m probably going to need to break into the restricted tower of the Library,” he said, before looking to me for… support? Unless he wanted someone to tell him not to go through with it, and that’s what he wanted to hear from me.

“Well, I suppose this is a case where might makes right Quinn. If you do break in, get whatever you need to lift the curse, and don’t get caught… Well, if you manage to lift the curse no one will care, even if they discover *how* you did it some time later. If you don’t lift the curse, or are caught before you can manage it, well then you’ll likely face expulsion,” I shook my head in exasperation, “Why tell me though Quinn? It seems foolish, what if I went off and told someone what you were planning? What if I thought it was far too risky, and decided to remove you from the club so that you didn’t bring down any of the rest of us. Telling me seems like the sort of thing that’s most likely to come back to bite you… Are you doing the ‘honesty’ thing again?”

He grinned, “Yeah, I figured you should know.”

I just shook my head, “Why?”

“I don’t want to lie to you.”

“Not telling me something you’re planning is not the same as lying. All you needed to do is say nothing, and you would have been fine. It wouldn’t technically be a lie, and you’d be able to get away with doing it while I was none the wiser.”

He waved his free arm dismissively, “Whatever, I don’t want to deceive you. You’d still be pissed if I did something like this behind your back, even if I didn’t technically lie to you.”

I cupped his face in one of my hands, “That is very sweet Quinn, even if it is a little naïve. Are you going to be so quick to warn someone like Andrew of any such deceptions?”

“Hell no,” he said, “Just you. Maybe some of the other club members depending on the situation, but not anyone else. It’s the smart thing to do.”

“Really?” I asked, a little amused.

“Yeah. It happens in stories all the time. So many potential problems could be solved by the characters just talking to each other. Instead they’ve all got convoluted reasons for not telling anyone else what they’re doing, and it almost always causes problems that wouldn’t be problems in the first place if they’d just damn well talk to each other.”

“And here I thought it was because communication is important in a healthy relationship,” I said, more than a little exasperated.

“That too,” he added quickly, “Though that was more important in the first case. I didn’t want you finding out about the reality of my heritage from someone else, especially if the two of us had already grown close by then.”

“So I was right the first time then,” I laughed, “Sweet, but a little naïve. Fine, you’ve told me, and I don’t hate the idea. How do you plan to get into the forbidden section anyway?”

“Well that’s the issue. I need a better idea of the defences in place. Do you know how I might find out more?” He asked, “Or do you know more yourself?”

“Some,” I hedged, “It’s broad strokes mostly, but I’ll tell you what I know for certain. The tower rises six stories from the roof of the Library itself, and it’s only those upper portions of the tower that are restricted. The lower six floors, the ones that are contiguous with the rest of the Library proper, are unrestricted. There are several layers of defences in place. The first is a layer of heavy enchantments between floors six and seven, between the unrestricted and restricted sections. Mostly it consists of magically locked and warded doors. You can create an anti-magic field around one of the doors that lead up to the next level, but that has a few problems. First, the door is still locked mechanically, and the locks are of the highest quality. I imagine that picking them or otherwise bypassing them would be extraordinarily difficult. Second, the doors, along with the whole rest of the Library, is constructed of Adamant.”

“Adamant?” Quinn asked.

“Adamant is to granite, as granite is to talc,” I explained.

“Damn, well I guess I’m not going through then. Though destructive entry wouldn’t be a good idea, even if it was possible.”

“There’s also the third issue with using anti-magic, which is that it sets off all manner of alarms, which means you’re quickly swamped by all manner of irritated administrators and teachers. There’s a similar issue with trying to alter or overpower the enchantments. It’s probably possible, but it sets off the alarm.”

“What about Teleporting in? I imagine that was the first thing on their list of stuff to protect against when they were building the place, but how do they prevent it?”

“The rest of the tower, everything beyond the heavily enchanted barrier, is inside of an anti-magic field. It also extends upwards by nearly half a mile, and out to the sides of the tower by something like one or two hundred metres. I don’t know the specific figures, but I know it’s far enough that there are a couple spots in the other towers that just peek inside of the field. It’s not much though, the pockets never extend more than a couple of feet inside the nearer towers.”

“Hmm,” he said, “Quite the puzzle.”

# Chapter 49

*Quinn*

-----

I was sitting with my arm around Victorina, considering the problem that the Library presented and flipping idly through my phone when the worst happened.

Well, maybe not the worst, but it was pretty awful all the same.

The door to the Library was flung open roughly, and Thera called, “Quinn, are you in here? Do you know where Vic-“ she stopped suddenly, putting a shocked hand to her mouth, “Oh.”

*Dammit.*

“Oh, oh my,” she giggled, before turning and running off, “Brandy! Brandy you’ve got to see this!”

I sighed as Thera’s rapid footsteps receded down the hall, and looked down at Victorina. She’d not bothered with any makeup, hadn’t done much more than drag a brush through her hair, and was wearing my oversized and rumpled hoodie. It was an odd look, or at least it was an odd look on her. It gave her a very girl-next-door vibe, when she normally looked every bit like the professional woman. Not just any sort of professional woman either, a professional Mage, and professional princess. She looked wholesome rather than lethal, and it felt special to see this side of her. I don’t know if she was entirely comfortable with me seeing that side of her though. Building this club and maintaining her position in the University probably hadn’t been easy, and she’d probably learned very quickly not to show weakness, and I guessed that the little princess-commoner routine was her way to make up for showing me the softer side of herself. I wasn’t quite sure how I felt about it, especially since it reminded me an awful lot of my treatment at the hands of Chypia, but at least it gave me the chance to reference The Princess Bride.

*That might be it worth it all by itself.*

“Is it a problem if the others know?” I asked, ”I’m pretty new to this whole being royalty thing.”

She raised her brows, “Well that’s putting it lightly isn’t it, but no, it’s not a problem. If you were seen as a commoner, then it would certainly cause difficulties for me, but as far as the University is concerned you are what you claim to be. No political ramifications, though I imagine that we’re going to endure a great deal of teasing from the others.”

“That might actually be worse,” I said flatly, as two pairs of footsteps came clomping back down the hall.

“Look at them, don’t they look so cute cuddling on the couch?” Thera said to Brandy, who was standing with her in the doorway.

“Oh my god, and she’s wearing his hoodie too!” Brandy squealed.

“I hate you so much right now,” I groaned.

“And he saved her life, which is just the most romantic thing in the world,” Thera said, with a big stupid grin on her face.

“Hey!” Victorina growled, “I saved him back.”

“That’s even *more* romanticer!” Brandy squeed.

“Romanticer is not a word,” I sighed.

“Go away,” Victorina commanded, in a tone that promised imminent violence.

“Oh you two are just so super precious that I could *die*,” Brandy cooed.

“That can be arranged,” Victorina promised, and I felt her grip tighten around my waist.

“You know Victorina, I always thought that this is exactly the sort of thing you needed. A chance to relax, let your hair down, and enjoy yourself,” Thera said, as she gleefully ignored Victorina’s demands, “Or, I guess, you’re not exactly enjoying *yourself-*”

Victorina hopped up off of the couch, and shouted a word, arm extended towards Thera. Thera slammed the door shut just as a large globe of water splashed against it, and I thought for a moment that they’d finally leave us alone.

Then Thera opened the door just a crack, “Don’t think you’ll get away with keeping all the *juicy* details to yourself Vicky, I’ll expect a full report,” she said quickly before slamming it again, just as Victorina launched another globe of water.

It was finally quiet in the Library again, though I could still hear the hush of rain against the windows outside, and the two of them giggling to eachother as they scurried off down the hall.

I watched Victorina as she cast a spell to clean up the mess she’d made, and while she’d clearly found the other two irritating, I could see that she was smiling a little to herself.

“Where were we?” She asked, once she’d returned to her place at my side.

“I was looking for a movie which would accurately portray what life on earth is like. Or at least, something that would give you an idea of what it’s like,” I said, as I unlocked my phone.

*Probably not Avengers or Star Wars…*

“Right, and you still haven’t explained what a movie is,” Victorina said, as she snatched one of my arms and draped it around herself.

“It’ll be self-explanatory, I just need to find… ah… well that’s just perfect isn’t it?” I said, finally seizing upon the perfect thing to show Victorina.

*This is going to blow her fucking mind.*

“What’s it called?”

“House of Cards.”

------

*Quinn*

------

“Hey,” Victorina said sleepily, as I tried and failed to rise without waking her.

“Hush, go back to sleep,” I said softly, as I slipped her fingers gently from my wrist.

She’d gone to bed the night before while wearing my hoodie, and looked awfully cute as she lay sprawled face down in my bed, with the hood mostly covering her face.

“The sun’s barely up, where are you going?” she mumbled.

“Class,” I explained, “and I want to get something to eat for breakfast.”

“Mrm,” she grumbled incoherently, “I already told you, we don’t need to go if we don’t want to.”

“I know Victorina,” I whispered, as I knelt down beside the bed, “But I’m not about to miss the first day of classes, not when I’ve spent most of a year working up to this.”

“I had plans for today,” Victorina said, as she rolled over and cast her irritated gaze at me, “Plans that involved not getting out of bed until noon.”

“Later,” I promised.

“Fine,” she said haughtily, “But I had better be somewhere on your to do list.”

“Oh, you are,” I smiled.

It wasn’t that I didn’t want to spend a day enjoying the very naked company of the most beautiful woman I’d ever met, it was actually one of the things I *most* wanted to do, but I didn’t want to ruin it, and I didn’t really feel the need to rush. When I’d first arrived in Elardia I’d been fairly starved for female attention, and it had probably showed most in how reluctant I’d been to give Sila a more firm refusal. The week with Thera, even if it might have been a touch foolish in hindsight, had done a lot to help me get over that. I’d gotten my fill of the physical attention I’d been missing, and there had maybe even been some genuine affection between the two of us. It hadn’t been much more than that though. It wasn’t love at first sight that had made Thera set her sights on me, it was physical desire combined with curiosity, and a little boredom. Now that didn’t mean that there was anything wrong with a purely physical relationship, and in fact if the week in Myra had been the only time I’d really been with anyone then I would’ve been happy to take Victorina up on her offer. It had been three or four months since Myra after all, and realistically speaking I’d wanted quite a bit more than just a single week of fun. I’d stepped onto that boat satisfied, but still wanting more. And holy fucking hell, I’d gotten more hadn’t I. And that was exactly the problem, which is to say, Chypia was the problem. That had been a very twisted month of my life, and I was only in looking back on it that I’d realized just how twisted it really was. Physically at least I’d gotten my fill, and more besides. It was coupled though, with the most fucked up emotional relationship I could conceive of, and it was that side of things that I’d really been lacking.

For Thera I’d been a curiosity, for Chypia a toy, and I didn’t want either of those to be the case with Victorina. Much like Brandy I did find the idea of the two of us saving each other’s lives very romantic, but that was only step one, and it didn’t take care of the other thousand steps afterwards. I wanted to make sure that this wasn’t a simple matter of infatuation, on her part or mine, before I got too serious about things. *Though we have started sleeping in the same bed, which does rather skew your plans, now doesn’t it Quinn?* I could see how the shared experience of nearly dying could end with the two of us in a short but very heated tryst, and maybe I was a little naïve, but I found myself wanting something more than that. I’d had my fill and then some of quick and dirty, and I wanted to hold out for something more.

-----

It was still raining as I stepped out onto the street in front of the clubhouse, not since it had started up during the ill-fated carriage ride. I’d initially thought it a little ominous, but it was apparently normal for this part of Nimre in the autumn. I found a café near the building where my first class would be held, and had a rather delicious breakfast, though I found myself wishing that there was a local Tim Horton’s.

*I’ve got to put ‘invent sandwiches’ on my to do list, along with chocolate and coffee.*

My first class of the day, to be held in the morning on Mondays and Tuesdays, was An Introduction To Battle Magic. The class itself was a little underwhelming, though that was probably do to with the fact that this was only the first week. It felt an awful lot like the first week of classes each semester at U of T, which meant that it mostly consisted of a brief orientation and some introductions. I didn’t recognize anyone in the class, though I was evidently recognized as ‘the tall human’. Word of what happened the night before last had apparently gotten around, and I got both irritated and impressed looks from the students in the small class.

Finally one of my more irritable class mates piped up, “Why are you even here, *your highness*?” he asked, though he managed to make it sound like an insult, “Maybe you just want the chance to show off your fancy thunder spell?”

I didn’t really mind the idea of being insulting towards royalty, in fact, I rather liked it. What I liked less was that sentiment being directed towards me.

“I know a handful of offensive spells, and only the two most basic defensive spells,” I explained, “If there had been a Mage in the party that attacked me then I would have had little hope of defeating him. There’s more to battle magic than being able to hit your opponent really hard. Maybe if you’d been paying attention then you’d know that those were some of the first words out of the professor’s mouth when he was explaining what this course is about.”

“Perhaps next time you’re unclear on something we’ve covered in class you might ask to see a friend’s notes, rather than challenging another student, hmm?” the professor said, cutting off the other student’s next remark, and bringing an end to the argument.

*That’s probably not won me many friends.*

-----

There were a few hours or so between this class and the next, and I took the opportunity to pick up the textbook that the professor had recommended. He’d mentioned that we should read the chapter on Mishaps in time for next week’s class, and very much unlike my normal self, I decided not to procrastinate on the homework.

After purchasing the book and sitting down to read the chapter I decided that Mishaps should actually be called Fumbles. Specifically, Critical Fumbles.

*Holy shit, this really seems like the sort of thing I should have been told about sooner.*

Granted, it was a relatively minor risk for me, but the consequences were rather severe. It reminded me of any number of Critical Spellcasting Failure tables, or of the Wild Magic options for AD&D. Much like those examples, such Fumbles could simply be irritating and amusing, but some were truly deadly. A healing spell Fumbled might make the person glow green for a few days, or it might cause a permanent and debilitating injury that was then immune to further magical healing. The chances seemed to scale with how well the Mage knew the spell, which meant that while I had relatively little to worry about, Wizards and Mages without much talent had a *great* deal to worry about. For me, even for a spell I’d only put the bare minimum of study time into, the chances of a Fumble were one in a couple thousand, and if they did happen they were almost certainly to be of the non-life threatening variety. For the less talented though, it was a significant risk, anywhere from one in fifty, to one in twenty. And when they did happen, they were much more likely to be of the life threatening sort.

Mishaps were part of what made it much more time intensive to learn spells as a less talented Mage. They already took longer to learn a spell in the first place, and once they did learn the spell, they’d still be casting it less skilfully that a highly talented Mage. It might take a Wizard months or years of study to understand a spell as well as I could after even a day of study, but that wasn’t their only disadvantage. They also had to contend with the fact that when they first ‘learned’ a spell, it was all but uncastable. Not only was it more likely to fall apart than actually work, but it was also possible that when it did fall apart, it would fall apart catastrophically. I’d originally wondered why Wizards and such don’t just deal with the problem by simply trying again, since it seemed perfectly viable unless it was a spell they’d need to use in combat. It certainly seemed better than spending a year of your life to learn freaking Apportation well enough to use it regularly, but this was the reason. Try enough times, and yeah, you’ll roll the success eventually, but you’ll also roll the critical fail eventually.

*On the topic of Apportation, I wonder how many times I’ve cast it… Damn, I need to get my hands working.*

# Chapter 50

*Quinn*

-----

My next class was on spell invention, and like Battle Magic it would be held on Mondays and Tuesdays, though in the afternoons rather than the mornings. This time I did recognize some of my classmates, and I was invited over by Diova. He had both Baron Bronippo and the green robed Tosa with him, as well as a woman I’d not seen before. She wore *very* simple robes, and while they’d been made well, I was pretty sure that they were made of undyed linen. She looked somehow like a combination of Victorina and Minki, both intense and shy, and it left her with a very ‘startled animal’ look. She didn’t have Victorina’s generous curves and sharply beautiful face, or Minki’s slim figure and softly cute features, and maybe it was cruel of me, but by ending up somewhere in the middle she just came out looking rather plain.

“Diova,” I nodded, “Who’s your friend?”

He waved a hand dismissively, “Mata, don’t mind her, how are you?” he asked, “You left quite the mess for the League to clean up, I’m surprised you’re here in fact.”

“Send me the bill,” I said wryly as I sat down, “And I’m fine. I only got shot a couple of times, and anything the robes didn’t stop, Victorina managed to heal.”

“Indeed, let no elf claim that you lack commitment. I take it that the spell in use was the one I’ve arranged to purchase?”

“Yeah, same one.”

“Well I saw the damage it did. A couple of the men, archers by their weapons, were found a not insignificant distance into the tree line, with wounds matching those done by your spell. Some of the projectiles had clearly passed through intervening trees to strike their targets, it’s impressive.”

“Not that impressive,” I said honestly, “Once I’d killed all those foolish enough to show themselves I was mostly casting it about into the darkness in the hopes of forcing the archers to keep their heads down, so that they’d not be given the chance to shoot back.”

“All the same, impressive. What do you call the spell anyway?”

*Uhh…. I still haven’t come up with a better name than MAC, which sounds dumb… Hold on, I was casting it at the darkness?*

“Magic Missile,” I said, *I CAST IT AT THE DARKNESS,* “I trust we’ll be making that exchange soon?”

He nodded, “I think it can be arranged so that there are minimal repercussions for either of us,” he said quietly, as the professor and most of the rest of the students finally arrived.

*I think that’s noble-speak for ‘I can make Andrew think that leaving is his own idea.’*

“Good,” I nodded, though I was a little distracted.

Nothus, the absolute giant of a man, had trailed in a bit behind the others. There were usually twelve people to a class like this, but Nothus looked to make thirteen. He looked even bigger up close, and while I didn’t get up to check, I was pretty sure that he was substantially taller than me. Maybe seven feet tall, and damn, he was jacked. He made The Rock look like a small man, and if I had to guess, I might have put his weight in the four hundred pound range, and none of that was fat. He had dull brown hair, and like many male elves he had it in a loose pony tail, though I was fairly certain that he wasn’t an elf. He did though have the same pointed ears as an elf.

*Now just hold on a minute… A human built like that would be a monster, but what if he’s got the same sort of strength as an elf? I’m nearly eighty pounds heavier than Thera, and she’s still just as strong as I am, maybe stronger. How strong is this guy gonna be? And he’s supposed to be the most talented Mage in the University, some things just are not fair at all.*

If anything let him down it was the robes he wore, everything else was impressive as hell. Even then, the robes looked like they might once have been very striking. They were red silk, though not crimson, and well cut, but very worn. They’d clearly seen a lot of use, and even with magic to patch any holes or mend any tears, they certainly looked like they were well past the point of needing to be replaced.

*Damn, I want to go talk to him, but I can’t really bail on Diova. I’ll try to catch him after.*

“A little excessive, don’t you think?” Diova commented quietly, as he noticed my gaze lingering on the monster of a man.

“That’s certainly one way to put it,” I whispered in reply, as the professor began his introductions.

-----

Like the previous class, not a whole lot of the actual subject matter was covered, and what the professor touched on briefly I’d already picked up when designing Magic Missile with Minki. Some things stuck out though, as being particularly interesting. Specifically the figures he gave on how long it usually took to modify a spell, or to invent an entirely new one. A simple modification supposedly would take an average of six weeks, while a brand new one could take six months, at least for Mages as talented as we all were. New enchantments were a little more involved, with it taking a year to modify an existing one to suit your needs, or two years if you’re trying to create one from whole cloth.

*It didn’t take me six weeks to come up with the initial build of Magic Missile, hmm…*

“Now as some of you are probably aware,” he continued, “Over the course of this semester you’ll be expected to do the design work for four spells. This does not mean that I want to see the lot of you all trying to come up with your own take on four different enchantments. You’re all adults, and of course you have some leeway, but generally it’s best to exercise some moderation. What I recommend, what the University recommends actually, is to begin by modifying an existing spell. Afterwards you’ll hopefully be experienced enough, and familiar enough with your partners, that you can go ahead and create two or three of your own spells. Some of you might want to try your hand at modifying an existing enchantment, and by all means, you can do that. But take it from me, someone who has seen the last minute panic in the eyes of many a student, make sure it’s an attainable goal, and wait to try it until after you’ve already gotten some practice with the normal sorts of spells.”

“Wouldn’t it be kinda hard to come up with three brand new spells?” a brown robed wood elf asked.

“Of course,” the professor nodded, “But this course is about process of spell creation, not the spells themselves. When I say that you need to ‘create’ a spell, I’m speaking of the process. Now, you might come up with an idea you’d like to explore, and that could very well be one of the spells you present to me. Alternatively, you could ‘create’ an existing spell, going through the same process that its original inventor would have followed. Fireball is a popular one, but you can choose any spell you’d like.”

“What size of group are we allowed?” Asked a smallish elf man in gold robes.

“Any size,” the professor replied, “Yes Nothus?”

“Does one count as any?” He asked, in a surprisingly young sounding voice.

I’d been expecting something low and rumbly, or loud and bombastic, but that was not what he sounded like at all. If he’d been human I would have guessed his age at fourteen to fifteen, based on the voice at least, and it was a little odd coming out of such a huge form.

“Yes Nothus,” the professor sighed, “It does.”

“Can I work alone too?” the small elf who’d spoken earlier asked.

The professor gave Nothus a brief, but long suffering look before answering, “Yes, though I would advise against it.”

“But why can Nothus do it and not me?” the elf asked, “I want to work alone because I can’t just go and share my ideas with whoever, but Nothus just wants to work alone because the freak knows that it’s not going to find any partners in the first place.”

“Alion,” the professor said shortly, “I would have thought that your tutors would have taught you something of tact. You will not speak to my students that way again. And I believe I did allow you such an option, though in your case I advise against it. We all have our limits, and must learn to work within them. I imagine that you have at least one other course this semester, possibly two, which means that you can’t possibly devote enough time to this course, while also keeping up with the others. Not if you’re going to try this alone.”

“But Nothus is-”

“Enough,” the professor cut him off, “I don’t care what colour those robes are young man, right now you’re my student. Nothus has the talent and work ethic to get this done alone in the time allotted, most of us do not. That means working in a group Alion, many hands make short work.”

*Suppose that makes sense, more talent and a willingness to work what an elf would consider double or triple shifts would get things done much more quickly. Hold on, does Nothus have human-scale endurance?*

“That’s enough for today,” the professor said, more than a little fed up, “Class is dismissed. Go form your groups, I’ll see you all tomorrow.”

Diova did not rise right away as the others hurried out, nobles couldn’t be seen to rush about after all, and instead turned to me.

“What of you Quinn? Are you going to go it alone?” he asked.

“Is that meant to be an invitation?” I asked wryly.

“You’re certainly talented, and I’d welcome any assistance that your presence might add, even if you don’t elect to share your Outsider knowledge.”

“The five of us then?” I asked, nodding towards the rest of his little posse.

“That is the idea,” he replied.

“Alright,” I agreed, “And I don’t think I’d be entirely against sharing what I know either.”

“Really?” Baron Bronippo asked, “What did you have in mind?”

“Well,” I smiled, “What do you think of using Light as the basis of a combat spell?”

-----

“Are you finally going to tell us what in the name of Mar you were talking about in class?” Tosa asked, as we finally took our seats at a nearby café

“Please, I gotta build suspense here,” I told him, “Actually, are there any Light based combat spells?”

“None come to mind,” Diova said, before giving Bronippo a questioning look.

Bronippo shook his head. Mata though seemed to have something to say, but she seemed almost frightened to speak up.

“What is it Mata?” I asked, looking to her expectantly.

“Umm,” she said, hunching her shoulders and glancing at Diova, “There’s one spell, it only really works against vampires or other monsters that fear the light though. It’s called Solaris.”

I shrugged, “Sounds like a good place to start.”

“How would the spell work anyway?” Diova asked, “I can see how conjured sunlight might be close enough to the real thing that a vampire would be burned by it, but how then would you use that against an elf or human?”

“Ah, I think I can show you,” I explained.

I fished around in a belt pouch for a moment, before drawing out one of the rejected lenses that I’d made when working on my replacement glasses.

*I’ve got to take a crack at making telescopes. Hawk Vision enchantments might exist, but they’re too unsteady for my needs if I want to start getting some idea of the local solarsystem.*

It still hadn’t stopped raining and we were sitting in doors, so I couldn’t use the lens to focus the light of the sun, but then I had magic after all.

I cast Light into an upended mug held with Apportation, putting a fair amount of power behind it. The Light wouldn’t follow the mug, but at least this way I could avoid blinding the other patrons.

I tossed a scrap of paper onto the table, and shone the light on it.

“See how bright it is now?” I asked, and the others nodded.

I put the lens in place, and shifted it around until I found the tightest focus I could, “See how much brighter it is now?”

“It’s even starting to smoke,” Diova noted, nodding at the paper which had indeed started to blacken.

I let the spell go a moment later, and gestured at the dark spot that had been left on the paper, “Of course, this is pretty unimpressive as examples go, but it proves the concept.”

“And you think that you could design the spell in such a way that the mana cost is not prohibitive for a combat spell?” Diova asked.

“Yes,” I nodded, “I’ve done some math, and some testing, and one mana seems about equivalent to fifty five Watts. A fifty Watt laser cutter, that’s what this would be, a laser, is already enough to do engraving and cutting. It would take a great deal of tweaking, but I think it’s certainly feasible. And even if it doesn’t work, it’s going to make Solaris a whole hell of a lot better at killing vampires.”

*Which are apparently a thing that exists?*

“A *laser*?” Tosa asked, “What, is that a fancy human word for focused light?”

I shook my head, “It’s more than that. Focused light alone might actually be able to do *something* to whatever you’re shooting at, but it’s probably going to end up being very inefficient when it comes to mana cost. Focused sunlight, well then that’s probably how you end up with a spell like Solaris in the first place. A laser is different, though it’s still focused onto a single point. I’m not sure how easy it is to create a temporary mirror using magic, but as long as we can make a couple of those it’ll mostly come down to dumping in enough power.”

“How big a mirror?” Diova asked.

I was interrupted briefly by one of the servers coming over to take our orders, and I took note of the fact that Mata requested only water.

“Right, mirrors?” I asked, once the serving girl had left, and Diova nodded, “Very small, an inch across at most.”

“Oh, that’s trivial then. I doubt that it would even impact the mana cost of the spell.”

“Perfect. We should be in good shape then.”

“Is the laser going to be as good as Magic Missile?” Bronippo asked.

“Well, it depends,” I hedged, “Even on Earth, laser weapons are mostly theoretical, and I’m not entirely sure what effect they’d have on a target. A laser might be fantastic against non-magical armour, much like Magic Missile, or it could be awful. It might pass right through even the toughest magical shields since other light will also pass right through them, or it could be that even the weakest magical shield could stop a Laser with a couple dozen mana behind it. It’ll come down to testing mostly.”

We spent a little more time at the café, theorizing and planning, before I finally went my own way. We’d all agreed to learn Solaris by this time next week, and hopefully one of us would be able to find a copy that could be removed from the Library. Of course, I could just scan the book with my phone, but that was less than ideal, and I didn’t really want anyone outside of the club handling such a valuable source of information.

-----

We’d gotten out of class pretty early, and even after spending a while at the café, I found that it wasn’t yet three o’ clock. I needed to learn Solaris anyway, so I decided to head for the Library. And aside from learning the spell, I also wanted another look at that tower. If all the defences were concentrated between the sixth and seventh floors, then it would make life way easier if I could just find a way out onto the roof of the Library from one of the other towers, and then walk across and climb through the seventh floor window.

It was hard to tell, as I peered through the midafternoon deluge, but from what I could see the windows on the Forbidden Tower were no different than the windows on any of the other towers.

*Well. I feel like it’s got to be harder than that.*

Learning Solaris was the priority for today, so I took care of that first. It actually wasn’t too hard to find a copy of the book, of which there were several. They were filed with some other vampire related material, rather than the other battle magic texts, which made sense considering Solaris’s rather niche use. I took a seat at the nearest table, and set to it with my phone.

I’d been unsure if the scanner app I had would be able to read the characters properly since the book, like every other book I’d found, was handwritten, but it managed to recognize the characters just fine. I gave mental thanks to both the programmer that wrote the app, and the scribe that copied the book out so plainly. I could have simply photographed every page, but reading that would have been a pain in the ass. I did still need to photograph the odd diagram, along with the symbols that taught the spell, but that was much more manageable.

*This’ll also give me a chance to learn whether the actual physical book has anything to do with learning the symbols. If I can work off of just a photo, then this is going to be much more manageable. It also means that I can photograph whatever I need from inside the Forbidden Tower, and not risk trying to take any of the books away.*

That did raise a question though. Were the forbidden books, like the regular books, enchanted with the same tracking and alarm spells as the rest of the collection? If they were, did that mean enchantments worked in an anti-magic field? And if that was the case, would it then be possible for enchanted items keep working back on Earth?

*Well, I guess I’ll find out at some point during in my enchantment class.*

The text on Solaris was not a very thick volume, and it didn’t take long to scan it into the phone. I checked the document over before putting the book away, and found everything to be in order. Now I’d be able to learn the spell at my leisure, without needing to be at the Library. That was not to say that I disliked the Library, quite the opposite. It was just that now I could make headway towards learning the spell whenever I liked, or if I was made to wait for something.

Once I’d shelved the book I headed over to one of the towers, the one closest to the Forbidden tower, and climbed the stairs to the seventh floor. This section of the building was clearly not very well traveled, and I could tell just by looking at the mess that was the shelves that this part of the Library had yet to be indexed and sorted.

*I could spend hours exploring in here.*

I found a window facing the right direction and peered out at the other tower through the old and warped glass and the rain. The fact that my glasses were still much less than perfect didn’t help, but I could make out the general details. The windows across the way were indeed of the same sort as the one I was now looking through, but they’d been barred. That wasn’t an insurmountable obstacle though, especially since the bars probably wouldn’t be iron or steel. I probably could go through that way if it came down to it, though that did raise a question. Were some bronze bars the only thing keeping curious students out of the Forbidden section? Probably not.

I considered the window in front of me, and pressed against it experimentally. It took some effort, but it gave eventually, and swung open. It had been old and warped in the frame, but the window had indeed been constructed to open. The smell of rain invaded the musky library, and the crash of rain on clay shingles sounded almost deafening when compared to the deathly quiet that had persisted throughout the tower initially. The thick cloud cover did make it rather dim, despite it only being a little past three, and I was suddenly struck by how easy it would be to walk across and take a look. It was not quite dim enough for my liking though. Elven eyes were good, and I didn’t want someone spotting the University’s only six and a half foot human sneaking across the roof of the Library to go peer through the windows of the Forbidden Tower.

No, I’d wait until it was dark, and I’d take the opportunity to try a couple different experiments at the same time. This did leave me with quite a bit of time to kill though, it was going to be a several hours before it was dark enough, what to do until then?

I shut the window gently.

*I’m going to spend hours exploring in here.*

-----

I lost myself in between the shelves, and while not every book was a goldmine, I did come across the occasional notable text. I didn’t waste time sitting down to read anything, and instead would scan anything that seemed interesting into my phone and then move on. I wanted to get the maximum amount of use out of every second I spent in here, and while I liked the idea of sitting down and reading through something interesting, it would be more efficient to save it to read later.

At least, that was the plan.

I don’t think I scanned more than two books before I got distracted by a text on various dangerous creatures. It was ‘Biduki’s Bestiary of Modern Monsters’, and damn but it was a massive book. I was barely a tenth of the way though it when I realized that I could barely see the page. I’d been reading by a window, and looked up to find that it was nearly pitch black outside. Even inside, it was very nearly too dark to see, and the only light came from one of the magical lights that occupied a wall sconce in the next aisle.

*Well, I guess I can go check out the other tower now.*

I didn’t quite hop up right away though, I wanted to finish this book after all, and wasn’t sure I’d be able to find it again if I came back later. So I spent another hour or so scanning it in with my phone, using the phone’s flashlight to keep the pages lit, rather than rely on Light.

*I’ll need to design my own version of Light. If one mana is fifty five Watts, then one mana ought to be a whole hell of a lot brighter than a candle.*

And it wouldn’t be just as bright as a fifty Watt bulb either, it should be a hell of a lot brighter. A fifty Watt bulb draws fifty Watts of power, but an incredible percentage of that is lost to waste heat. Jump from incandescent to LED and all of a suddenly that fifty Watt bulb draws only eight or nine Watts. So if you actually *did* put fifty Watts into an LED, then that would be damn bright. And magic had to be more efficient than even an LED. Even if an LED was 95% efficient at converting electricity to light, magic ought to be 100% efficient.

I considered this, as I walked back towards the window I’d loosened earlier, and pulled a chair to sit beside it. I removed my robes and folded them on the chair, replacing them with my non-enchanted but perfectly waterproof coat, which I’d drawn from my belt. The Portable Hole went onto the chair with the robes, as did my belt. I checked myself over, to make sure that my hawk vision amulet was the only enchanted thing on my person, and looked back over what I’d left on the chair.

One thing stuck out, and that was my multitool. It had a file on it, and with a couple strokes from it I’d have a pretty good idea of just how tough the metal of the bars was. There was one major problem though, and that was my hands. Once I stepped out onto the roof I’d be unable to use Apportation, and without that I had no way of holding the multitool, not if I wanted to try it on the bars at least.

*Right, add ‘Invent Duct Tape’ to the to do list.*

While I wasn’t able to just tape the thing to my forearm, I did have other options, and I went back through my belt and Portable Hole to find what I needed. I emerged eventually with some silk cord, which was expensive, but stronger than anything else I’d be able to get here in Elardia. I used it to tie the multitool to my hand, and while it wasn’t pretty, it would work.

I pushed the window open slowly, and climbed though, which is a hell of a lot harder than it sounds if your hands are useless.

I took my steps carefully as I walked across the rain slickened clay shingles. The roof wasn’t sharply slanted, but any fall would be a problem, since I’d have a very hard time catching myself.

It was only fifty or so metres from the one tower to the other, but they were fifty somewhat terrifying metres. I almost lost my footing more than once, and I was very glad for the flexible and grippy soles of my hiking shoes.

*Best shoes on the planet.*

I got to the other side eventually, and leaned against the wall to steady myself. To the eye at least, the bars looked no different than bronze, and the glass no different from any other sort of glass. Looking in through the window didn’t really reveal a whole lot, and it mostly just looked the same as the tower I’d just left, though it didn’t have any of the magical lights lit. It was dark, there were shelves with books, that was it. It wasn’t like I could use the light on my phone to look inside either. I couldn’t cast Apportation, and I didn’t really like the idea of walking across the roof while carrying a shining beacon. As it was, I settled for testing the materials of the tower.

I’d tied the multitool in place with the file extended, and I counted slowly to sixty as I drew the tool across the base of one of the bars. Once the minute was up, I checked the bar, only to find it almost entirely unmarked. I could barely pick out where I’d been trying to score it.

*Welp. Whatever it is, it’s harder than steel. Probably some relative of the material used to make the slave cuffs.*

I tried the stone next, working at the corner of the window, and again I ran the test for sixty seconds. And dammit, again, barely any mark was left on the stone. There was something there, the materials weren’t impervious, but it was barely noticeable. I wasn’t going through the walls, or the bars.

That left the glass, which turned out to be perfectly normal glass. It was fairly thick, but when I tried to score it with the tip of the file, I could clearly see the mark that was made. This was a small consolation though, considering there was no way in hell I was going to slip between the bars. I peered up through the falling rain to the upper floors of the tower, to see if they’d opted not to bar the windows higher up.

No such luck. Five floors of windows, and all were barred.

*Five? One, two… yeah, where’s the sixth floor?*

The darkness and the rain made it damned hard to see anything, but I only counted five sets of windows, including the one I was leaning against. I thumped a forearm against the hawk vision amulet to see if it would give me a closer look, only to find that it didn’t work.

*Right, so enchantments don’t work in antimagic fields.*

I gingerly made my way back to the other window, and slipped back inside. The raincoat came off and went back into the Portable Hole, and the robes went back on. I tried the hawk vision amulet again, as I peered back out the still open window, and thankfully it still worked.

*So an antimagic field supresses, but doesn’t destroy enchantments.*

The greater acuity offered by hawk vision let me figure out where the sixth floor of the tower was. It was where the sixth floor of a tower should be, above the fifth floor. From the ground I’d thought that it was simply part of the pointed roof, and from the base of the tower I hadn’t been able to distinguish it from the pitch black sky, but there was narrow balcony running around the tower at its very top.

*Stands to reason…*

I found the stairwell, using the flashlight on my phone to guide me, and ascended to the very top of the tower.

The very top floor of the tower felt much more like an attic, than a Library, and I could see the exposed rafters of the pointed roof above. There were also no interior walls here, and while it did feel much more open, without the shelves to break up the sight lines, I could see now that the towers were smaller than they felt. It was still fairly spacious though, and with the floor to ceiling windows, balcony, and generally open feeling of the room, I guessed that this would have been quarters for one of the University’s original administrators or professors. I walked across the floor of the empty room to the balcony doors, and pulled the hood of my robes up before pushing open the bronze framed glass door.

I activated the amulet again as I leaned against the balcony railing, and peered across to the doors on the opposite tower. It looked much the same, with floor to ceiling windows in bronze frames, and glass doors framed the same way. There were two differences though. The first was the thick chains that held shut the balcony doors, and the second was the lack of any railing on the balcony.

*Fifty metres. Is that far enough to be beyond the limits of elven endurance? I suppose not, not if they bothered to remove the railing. Either that, or someone did try to rope across, and the railing was too weak to support their weight.*

This thought made my heart jump in my throat, and I took several quick steps back, until I was up against the glass wall of the tower.

*I don’t see anywhere else to hook a grappling hook though. I don’t know that across is an option, not if the stone is too tough for some Batman like grapple gun to be able to pierce with a piton.*

I turned off the amulet, and did a quick circuit of the balcony. I knew what I’d see, but I looked all the same, I might have missed something after all. No such luck though. The Library, massive at twelve stories, was the tallest building in the whole city. A glider of some sort could still work if I used teleport to get the altitude, but I didn’t know how hard it would be to teleport that distance with such a large and cumbersome object.

*Well, it’s that or climb. Both are stupid, but at least with climbing I could tie off on those bars.*

It also reinforced my belief that the way in for me would need to be something that only a human could do, or only something that someone from Earth could think of. Over the course of a thousand plus years the elves would have tried most things, and most things that elves could do would have gotten security updates. That didn’t mean that the place was impregnable, no system was impregnable after all, and there probably was still some way for a clever elf to get in if he really tried. But it would be an uphill battle. No, not impregnable, but over a thousand years of security revisions would get them damn close. They weren’t making those revisions with modern humans in mind though, and that was why the way in had to be something that only a modern human could figure out.

Climbing, well that was probably it, and gliders as well to a lesser extent. It was not that climbing was some foreign art to elves, that was absurd, no, the problem was in their endurance. Climbing is one hell of a workout, and six stories straight up with minimal hand holds was probably more than any elf was capable of. Not only that, but they’d need to do it in the dark, and quickly enough that no one noticed them. They wouldn’t have time to stop and rest part way up, not when someone might still see them, even if they picked a night like tonight. Gliders, well that was more of a conceptual thing, but the earliest working gliders I knew of on Earth weren’t built until the mid-1800s. There were questionable accounts as much as eight hundred years earlier, but even then, 1000AD was not Bronze Age.

*Landing would still be a bitch, even if they had the glider. This balcony is only a few feet wide, and the one over there has no balcony for them to catch themselves on.*

Climb up, pry a window out of its frame, slip inside, find the books I’ll need, scan them, slip back out, reset the window, and rappel back down.

Easy, for a human, if their hands work.

*Oh. Actually, not easy. The hardest part of that whole plan might be finding the stupid book. If it’s as disorganized in there as it is in this tower, then I’ve got a serious problem. It could take days to find what I’m looking for.*

That was a problem for another day though, and I’d have plenty more time to think on it while I took the time to get my hands working. I stepped out of the rain, and back into the spacious room at the top of the tower. It was almost ten as I checked my watch, and I clomped down the twelve flights of stairs quickly in an attempt to get back to the clubhouse at a reasonable time. I’d need to get up for tomorrow’s classes around six or six thirty, and I wanted to get some sleep.

-----

I got back to the darkened clubhouse not too much later, everyone else having gone to bed already, and slipped into my room.

Victorina was slumped in a chair by the fireplace, the flames having burned down to coals, with a book on her lap. She was out cold, and didn’t stir as I shut the door quietly. I disrobed silently, slipping into the light silk trousers I’d started wearing to bed since Victorina had taken up residence in my room, and got washed up for bed. Then I went to see about Victorina. She was shivering a little, it was a little chilly in the room now that the fire was out, and was dressed in a light but modest silk shift. Well, it modest by modern western standards, I wasn’t sure about Elardians, but it probably counted as ‘provocative’.

I set her book aside quietly, and picked her up as gently as possible. I was less than successful, as I tried to scoop her onto my arms with Apportation, and she stirred a little as I lifted her.

“Mmm, Quinn,” she whispered sleepily, “You’d better be carrying me to *your* bed.”

“Nah,” I whispered back, “I was actually gonna go dump you in the hall.”

“I’d expect nothing less from a common dog,” she said, as I set her down in my bed, before slipping in beside her.

She shivered a little, and I felt her cold hands slide around my chest as she snuggled up to me.

“Why didn’t you just go to bed?” I asked, “Even in my bed.”

“I was waiting for you to get home Quinn,” she whispered, her voice further muffled as her face was buried in my chest, and the covers were drawn up to her ears.

*Someone waiting for me to come home… Just what the hell did I do to deserve that?*


# Chapter 51

*Quinn*

-----

My next day’s classes were on Enchantment and Healing, probably the two subjects that I was most excited for. Enchantment, hopefully, would be able to assist me in bringing modern technology to Elardia. Pretty much everything I wanted to introduce was complex enough that it wouldn’t be a simple matter of knocking out a prototype in the clubhouse’s workshop. Each ‘invention’ would require several prerequisite inventions, and even each of those might require a few prerequisites of their own to be developed first. I had the time, now that I was effectively immortal, to do things the long way, but hopefully enchantment could stand in for those prerequisites in some places.

Healing of course would be what I needed to fix my stupid hands, and if all went well, it would also help me lift the curse on the Ariros guild hall.

*I need to fix my hands, learn the stasis enchantment, some healing, maybe just a touch of necromancy, and I think I can do this.*

I didn’t find either Nothus, who I still wanted to get to know, or Diova and his crew in the classroom as I slipped in just as class was about to start, so I settled into the first empty chair I saw while the professor got started. I quite liked the way that the University arranged their classes, with only twelve or so students and furniture that wouldn’t have been out of place back in the clubhouse’s sitting room. I’d gotten my fill of thousand person lecture halls and plastic seats back at U of T, so this was a welcome change of pace.

I noticed something particular, as the professor was having each of us introduce ourselves, and that was the odd proportion of nobles to peasants. Of the eleven other students here, seven were noble. Of course, my sample size was awfully low, but I’d been noticing similarly skewed numbers elsewhere in the University as well. Even just looking down a crowded hall, I’d seen that there were far more Mages wearing colours allowed only to those of privilege than made sense demographically.

Even if the University was willing to accept rather tenuous connections as ‘close enough’ for acknowledgement of noble status, the nobles couldn’t be more than one percent of the total population on Elardia. In fact, they were almost certainly less than that, but you wouldn’t think that if you just looked at a crowd of Mages.

I’d need to do a more detailed survey, *hell, I could just use my phone to photograph a crowd and count the colours,* but I was pretty sure that nobles were at least ten percent of the University’s population. And they were even more overrepresented when you considered the more talented groups of Mages.

*Maybe it’s hard for peasant Mages to be discovered? Or it might be that the noble’s attempts to breed for magical talent really are working, at least a little bit.*

There were a lot more questions that needed answering, especially when it was possible for two Mages to have a child without any talent at all, but the skewed demographics had to have some sort of cause.

*I do know one thing though, once I lift that curse, I’m going to start testing every single one of my subjects. Or Victorina’s subjects. I might settle for deputy hierarch, actually running the guild sounds like a hell of a lot of work, especially if I’d need to talk to people regularly.*

The teacher ended the class with a few demonstrations of different common enchantments, and then invited us all to examine a few pieces that had been made by other students as part of class projects. The lot of us all gathered around a large desk, upon which lay a horde of magical treasures.

*Damn, half of the random magical treasure table is sitting here.*

There were magic swords, bows, bits of armour, rings, and amulets of all kinds. There were also a few pieces that I decided must be Minor Wondrous Items, since they didn’t seem to fall into any easy categories.

“What’s this?” I asked, as I picked up what looked like an attempt at a clock, “Does it work?”

“Oh, that was for one particular project where I asked each of my students to take an everyday object and try to enhance it by way of some sort of enchantment. It does work, though it needs a mana stone to run.”

“Wait, so if it did have a mana stone, the enchantment would be able to use the stored mana to run the clock?” I asked.

“Yes,” the professor replied.

“So you’re telling me, that there is an enchantment that can turn mana, into rotational energy?”

“Yes, ah, are you quite alright?” he asked, looking a little concerned, “Um, why are you laughing like that?”

-----

I ordered lunch, almost in a daze, as I considered just what I could do with an enchantment like the one that was built into that clock. Could it work backwards, could I provide rotational energy and have it give back mana, instead of using mana to provide the rotation? How far could it be scaled up, could I make a magical car? There were enchantments whose entire role was to provide mana to other enchantments, and from what I’d read there wasn’t a limit to how many times you could layer that enchantment on a single item. Could I stack that a couple hundred times and power a magical car with just ambient mana? How far could you go before you started to deplete ambient mana?

I lost track of time at some point, and it was only when I happened to glance at my watch that I realized that I was almost late for my class on Healing. I managed to get there on time though, and I was happy to see that Nothus was in attendance as well. There weren’t any empty seats near him though, so I found a comfy chair near the door to fall into.

This class, like Enchantment, also shared the uneven distribution of nobles to peasants, and I also noticed that Nothus and I were the only two men in the room. For noble women healing was probably considered one of the more ‘lady like’ pursuits, while battle magic was too much like fighting, and enchantment too much like the work a smith might do. For peasant women on the other hand, healing was probably the sort of magic that would be most helpful if they returned home, and so made quite a bit of practical sense.

The professor too was a woman, the first female professor I’d seen so far, other than Lili herself, and she looked every bit like someone’s favourite grandmother. Short, though not for an elf at five feet tall, with curly white hair. She didn’t have many wrinkles, though if she was a Mage then showing any age at all meant that she was not someone to be trifled with. She was also just a little plump, and wore pastel green robes that reminded me of a nurse’s scrubs.

She had us all introduce ourselves, and it was only then that I realized that Mata was sitting right beside me. I’d barely noticed her when she’d first walked in, she seemed just so... boring. Average height for an elf, average build, with a plain look to her, both in appearance and dress, when it was all put together it just made her fade into the background.

After introductions the first thing that Professor Nanna, *yeah, professor nanna, not kidding,* covered was Mishaps, and she made it very clear that healing magic was not to be trifled with. Even without a Mishap, or Fumble as I still thought of them, it was possible to do irreparable damage to someone if you weren’t careful. A Fumble then could be lethal, even in the case of Mages as talented as us, and she recommended that in most cases we should cast healing spells with the full set of gestures and incantations whenever it was possible. Doing so would apparently further reduce the chance of a Fumble to as near to zero as it was possible to get. More speedy castings of healing spells were to be reserved for cases where the increased risk was outweighed by the need for haste.

“I also want each of you to pick a partner, healing can be risky, and it’s best if each of you have someone to watch your back. Yes, even you Nothus,” she said, in a no nonsense tone, just as Nothus seemed to be getting ready to say something, “I’m sure you can find someone willing to work with you if you ask nicely.”

*Score!*

“Now come on, get up, talk to each other, I’m sure you all can manage that, it’s not so difficult. Take your time, and find someone you can work with.”

I drew attention immediately, and more than half the class tried to edge over to where I was sitting, I guess they all wanted to partner with the Outsider. Mata in particular was almost trampled by two women that looked so much like Halea, at least from the neck down, that I thought for a moment that they must be two of her sisters. It wasn’t just that they all had wide hips, a narrow waist, and generous breasts, after all, the same could be said for Victorina. No, these two and Halea had the *exact same* wide hips, narrow waist, and generous breasts. Clothes aside, from the neck down, the three of them could have been clones. It was only in the facial features that I could tell them apart, and it was there that I realized that despite the strange similarities in build, the three of them shared no relation.

I wasn’t quite swarmed, in fact most of the others didn’t actually approach me, but they looked like they might have if I hadn’t already been entertaining offers from some of their classmates.

“Excuse me,” I said, as I slipped around the two not-Haleas.

I got a pair of pouty looks from the two of them, which turned to disappointment when I seemed unfazed, and then irritation when they realized who I wanted for my partner.

“Hey,” I said flatly, as I threw myself down in a chair next to Nothus that had been vacated by one of the two not-Haleas.

He raised an eyebrow, but didn’t speak.

I rested one elbow on the arm of the chair as I leaned towards him, “Partners?”

“You barely know me,” he said, in his teenager’s voice.

I shrugged, “Well everyone else who knows you doesn’t seem to like you, maybe I’m exactly the sort of person you need.”

He rolled his eyes, “Fine, I’m Nothus,” he said, extending a hand.

“I’m Quinn,” I replied, “Though I don’t think I can do the whole handshake thing.”

“Right, I heard about that, do you mind if I take a look?” He asked.

“Sure?” I said, twisting so that my hands rested on the small table between our chairs.

He didn’t spend a whole lot of time prodding at them, and instead he started casting something, *an MRI spell?*

I found my eyes drawn to the two women again, and the more I ‘examined’ the two of them, the more sure I was of the similarities.

“Maybe you’d like a better looking partner?” Nothus asked, once he was done his spell.

“It’s not that,” I said, turning back to him, “They just look exactly like someone I know.”

He nodded, “They probably all used the same sort of shape changing magic.”

“What?” I asked, furrowing by brows.

“If you’ve got enough money, and you decide that you want to look a little different, there’s all sorts of ways to make the change happen. You can do it with spells, enchantments, or even some alchemical potions. They probably all used the same one, can’t remember exactly what it’s called, maybe Verri-something Reshaping. But if you want to come out looking like you belong in some Emperor’s harem, then it’s the one to get.”

*That’s probably how Chypia altered Pasa and Aris to match her house colours.*

“Interesting,” I said, frowning in though, “Find anything with that spell?”

“Yeah,” he said, before casting another spell, “Here, look.”

And there was suddenly an illusion floating between us, a perfect three dimensional image of the nerves in my hands and forearms.

“All these,” he hesitated, “Whatever they’re called, are all like one big scar.”

I nodded distractedly, “I had guessed that was the case,” I said, *well, now that I can see them clearly, I wonder if-*

“Easy fix though,” he said, before muttering a word.

It took me a moment to realize what he’d done. I looked down at my hands, confused at what felt like a sudden warm breeze blowing across them.

*Holy fuck.*

I moved my hands, clenching them and unclenching them.

*Holy fuck.*

There was no stiffness, and none of the clumsiness that I would have expected to come along with recovery from nerve damage. They were perfect, as good as new.

“Holy fuck.”

I looked up at Nothus, “Is this permanent?” I asked.

He nodded, “Yeah.”

“Well,” I stated, looking down at my hands, “You’re my new best friend.”

“Thanks?” he said uncertainly.

“Ah, a question though,” I said, “Why are you in the beginner healing class if you can do stuff like this?”

He shrugged, “I know plenty of healing magic, and I’ve got that spell to look inside of someone to see what’s wrong, but I don’t know much about the non-magical aspect of healing. There’s some things that people do without magic that are supposed to be able to help, and I want to see if I can come up with a way to do some of those things magically.”

“Hey, sounds good,” I said as I leaned back in my chair, “I’ve got some ideas along the same lines, mostly involving trying to apply some Earth knowledge by way of magic.”

“Earth?” he asked, “Is that where you’re from?”

I nodded, “What about you?”

“Um,” he grimaced, “Sorry, I just don’t want to talk about it. Sorry, I know it’s not really fair.”

I waved one hand absently, *I can wave my hands!* “It’s fine, I get it.”

*Not everyone who ends up here is going to be as happy as me to be torn away from their home and everything they know.*

“Alright everyone, settle down.” Professor Nanna said, “You two as well, it’s nice that you’ve made a friend Nothus, but quiet down now.”

There was some bookkeeping, and she went over some more of the basics of healing magic and assigned a few chapters of reading before finally letting us go early. We were even given the next day off, which I appreciated. As with enchantment, whose professor had also given us tomorrow off once I finally finished laughing manically, Professor Nanna wanted us to finish the assigned reading before going forwards. At first I was a little surprised at how narrow the section was, and how long we were being given to read them, but it made sense once I considered how much these people must read. Even if everyone here was literate, that didn’t mean the same thing here, as it did on Earth. On Earth, even if you weren’t like me and would read a couple novels a month, most people would read an incredible amount. Not road signs and such, they didn’t count, but pretty much everyone had a smart phone. Most time spent in front of a screen, unless it was playing a movie, involved reading to one degree or another. Elves on the other hand, not including the few that read for pleasure, probably read very little. One particularly thick Earth novel was probably more reading than any one elf would do in their life, even if they happened to be a noble.

I was in beginner classes which meant that most here were probably new to the University, so most of my classmates then would be reading more now than they’d ever been before, so I supposed that it made sense to give them time to get used to it.

For me it just meant that I had the rest of the week off, so I was perfectly happy with this arrangement.

“Want to go get something to eat?” I asked Nothus, as we were leaving.

“I don’t know,” he said uncertainly.

“It’ll be my treat. There’s a nice place not too far from here. I owe you anyway, for fixing these,” I said, as I wiggled my fingers.

“Alright,” he agreed.

-----

We went to the same café that I’d met Diova at, and I ordered a light afternoon snack. Nothus on the other hand, after asking me uncertainly if I minded, ordered a truly gargantuan amount of food. I was happy to pay for it though, and I asked him about his MRI spell as we ate.

“Well as long as you’re not in an antimagic field,” he explained, “then there’s ambient mana about us all the time. We pass through it even, so all my spell does is take a good look at the ambient mana inside of the body part I want to look inside of. Everything interacts with mana just a little differently, and that’s how I tell one thing apart from another.”

“Damn, that’s pretty clever,” I said honestly, “Would you have anything against sharing it?”

He shrugged his massive shoulders, “No, I can bring my notes to class next week, and I can teach it to you.”

“That’s perfect, though now that’s two I owe you.”

He shook his head, “Its fine. Besides, you’re the first person to pick me as a partner willingly. The professor usually ends up needing to instruct someone to be my partner if I can’t just work alone, and then they spend the whole semester hating that they’ve been forced to work with me. Thanks for not judging me too harshly.”

I shrugged, “its times like this that I’m only made more certain that laziness is a virtue.”

“Really? A virtue?”

“I’m too lazy to keep track of who I’m supposed to scorn or be bigoted against, so I treat everyone mostly the same, seems awfully virtuous to me,” I said airily, “Except for Andrew, fuck that guy.”

*And it probably helps that I’ve got no idea why people don’t like you. I always thought that everyone had a, sometimes literal, hard on for Outsiders.*

He frowned, “Why don’t you like Andrew? I thought he’s your cousin?”

“You’ve seen how he fights in the arena, haven’t you? And besides, he seemed eager for his father to cut me off from my bursary. And there’s some familial baggage there of course,” I explained, “Why do you care?”

“Well, Andrew is one of the only other people that treats me decently,” he said quietly, “Maybe you should be nicer to him.”

I spread my hands, “Probably, mostly I just stay away from him though. Easier that way.”

He didn’t say anything more on the subject, and we chatted a little more on the subject of healing spells before finally splitting up to head back to our respective clubhouses.

*I’ve got to find out which club he’s in, and see if Victorina would be okay with him joining our team.*

-----

The rest of the day, now that my hands worked, was spent shopping for climbing equipment. Though in this case ‘climbing equipment’ mostly meant a lot of rope. I already had pretty good footwear for this sort of thing, and it wasn’t like I was going to be able to knock pitons into the adamant walls of the tower, or use climbing axes to chop out hand and foot holds. No, I was going to end up doing the climb Assassin’s Creed style, though with the added safety of a tie-off at every floor.

The trouble, now that I had a chance to think beyond climbing the tower, was going to be twofold. First, I had to get inside. I was pretty sure that I could pop a window out of its frame, or failing that, I could file through the chain. That did require the chain to be normal bronze though, and not the same material as the window bars. The third option then, was to smash a window. That would definitely work, but I did not like the idea of leaving evidence of a break in, especially since I expected that I’d need to stay inside of the tower for at least a few of hours, or even a couple of days.

That led to problem two, which was the rope. If I used it to tie off at each floor, then I was going to have a hard time finding a way to pull the rope back up once I got to the balcony. And if I left it there, then it wouldn’t take a genius to realize what had happened.

It was a problem, but one I could solve at my leasuire.

I bought the rope regardless, and stuffed it into a belt pouch.

*Climbing down is going to be a bitch though if I’ve got no rope going down, and it’s not like I could tie it off at the top and repel down either. That would leave me with the same problem, since I wouldn’t be able to get it down afterwards.*

I did stop by The Mercers’ enchantment shop to speak with Amezzer, and found myself a possible contingency. There was apparently such a thing as a ‘Ring of Feather Fall’, and I bought two. One to go on my now working hands, *my hands work!* and one to go in the pouch next to the spare ring of water breathing.

It might allow a speedier decent, if I leapt from the side of the tower that was away from the greater structure of the Library. The first six floors were in the anti-magic field, but the last six weren’t. That should give the ring enough time to catch my fall, and then I wouldn’t need to bother with ropes at all.

-----

I got back to the clubhouse a bit before supper, and found myself reaching for the door with Apportation.

*It’s going to take me a while to get used to using my hands again.*

I let the spell go, and turned the doorknob by hand for the first time ever, feeling the cool metal against my palm. I did a quick check through the clubhouse to see who was all here, before heading up to the kitchen to make supper for everyone. I did find myself using Apportation for some tasks, but only because I found it helpful to have some extra sets of hands, and not because I had to.

I was slicing up some pepperoni, or what passed for pepperoni here in Elardia, for the pizza when Victorina poked her head in.

“What are you making Quinn? I’m star-“ she stopped suddenly, “Quinn! Your hands!”

“Yup,” I agreed, “They work.”

“That’s fantastic,” she said, as she stepped into the room and slipped her arms around me in a tight hug.

“Careful,” I laughed, “I’m holding a knife here.”

“How though? Today was only your first healing class, you can’t have figured out how to fix them that quickly.”

“Are you sure?” I grinned, “I’m pretty smart.”

She squinted at me, “Maybe, but I don’t think so. How did it happen?”

“Nothus fixed them,” I explained, “Used one spell to find out what was damaged, and another to fix it. Took almost no time at all.”

“Hmm,” she mused, “That was awfully nice.”

“What is it Victorina?” I asked, “You seem almost suspicious.”

“It just seems a little too easy Quinn,” she said, “I imagine that some sort of favour is going to be expected in return.”

I just shrugged, “Seems like a pretty fair trade to me. If Nothus does expect something of me, then I’ll make sure that it’s me repaying the favour, and not the club.”

She nodded, “I can accept that. The question now,” she said, taking one of my hands in both of hers, “Is just what to do with these now that they work.”

I raised an eyebrow, “Oh?”

“Oh yes, there’s a few things that I want you to do to me with these,” she said, in a suggestive tone, “I’m not going to let you put this off any longer.”

“I wouldn’t dream of it,” I smiled, “But give me back my damn hand before someone walks in. Besides, I’ve got dinner to make.”

“After dinner,” she promised, before finally retreating to the sitting room.

-----

I received congratulations from the rest of the club once they finally recognized that I was holding the pizza with my hands, and not with Apportation. It was a very nice feeling, to have people that cared as much as they did, and it strengthened my resolve to do right by them. If it came right down to it, I was going to climb that tower without any ropes at all, if that’s what it took to get up there undetected. They deserved better than living off savings, and their families would be a whole lot less likely to give them a hard time if they were each a deputy hierarch of the University’s newest guild.

*It’s not just power for power’s sake. Power is the freedom to act, and freedom is exactly what they need.*

Afterwards, Victorina insisted on some after dinner entertainment. I was instructed to dress for bed, and then join Victorina in her room.

My heart might have been beating a little quickly, as I gently pushed open the door to her room. I stepped through to find the room lit by dozens of tiny pink motes of light that floated about the room, and Victorina standing in the middle of the room, wearing a white silk robe that was tied very loosely at the front. The pink light played across her skin and reflected off of her metallic hair as each mote lazily circled the room, and she stared at me with an intense expression as I slowly shut the door. Her eyes were aflame, but the rest of her look promised violence if she didn’t get something to sate her appetite, and soon.

She pointed firmly at the floor in front of her, while pulling lightly at the belt that held shut her robes.

I raised an eyebrow, and cocked my head to one side.

“A commoner ought to kneel before his princess,” she said darkly, finally pulling the knot apart, “Kneel,” she commanded, before rolling her shoulders and letting the robe fall to the floor.

She was not wearing anything underneath, and damn. She was perfect. She looked every bit as hard, and every bit as beautiful, as a marble statue. Every curve, from the swell of her breasts to the dimples on her belly, looked like they might have been the product of days of careful attention by the most skilled artisans. There was no uncertainty in her stance, and she looked every bit as confident now, as she had when addressing royalty at the ball, or as she had when cutting down the men that had attacked us afterwards.

I stalked towards her, and I could see her face flush and hear her breath quicken as I approached.

“What if the commoner is feeling a little rebellious?” I asked, as I stopped with my bare chest just inches from her nose.

She met my gaze with a fierce look, “Quinn?” she asked.

“Yes?”

“Don’t be gentle,” she said huskily.

*Mmm, I’m glad these rooms are soundproof.*

I set one hand on her waist, feeling the softness of her skin and the firmness of the muscles as I slid my hand upwards. My hand cupped the swell of one substantial breast, and I teased at her already quite hard nipple with a thumb. I drew my hand up further, briefly circling her neck, before lifting her chin up with one finger, and drawing her into a kiss. She responded hungrily, and pressed herself against me as she lifted herself up onto tip toe. I buried my hand in her thick hair as I pulled her further into the kiss, and she let out an eager growl as I clenched those fingers into a fist, holding her by the very roots of her hair. I pulled her away after a moment, and she looked up at me with a flushed face and watering eyes that demanded more.

“Bed,” she gasped, as she hooked one finger in the waistband of my pants.

“Not just yet,” I said, my voice coming out hoarser than I’d intended.

With the firm grip on her hair I forced her to turn away from me, and I half pushed, half pulled her over to her desk. In my haste I practically threw her down onto it, holding her there with the grip I maintained on her hair. She clutched the far edge of the table in a while knuckled grip, and spread her legs apart as I kicked off my pants.

“You bastard,” she gasped, “Don’t you sarding dare tease-“

I drove myself hard into her, and she let out a sound somewhere between a high squeak and a low moan. My other hand found her waist and gripped it tightly as I threw myself against her, and she let out a primal and animalistic grunt with every thrust.

“Yes, yes, yes,” she said through clenched teeth, “Harder, please, harder.”

I pressed her down more firmly onto the hard wood of the table to try to stop her from squirming around, and let her have it. The animalistic grunts turned into gasping moans, and the lights flickered with every moan.

“Don’t stop, don’t stop, just like that,” she begged, forcing the words out through a strangled gasp, “Just like that.”

She curled one leg behind herself, seemingly in a vain attempt to draw me in closer, and I decided that I’d had enough of the squirming. I grabbed her ankles roughly with my manipulators and I pulled them apart. I used more of my magic to hold her in place, and I forced a gasp out of her as an immense weight pressed her down into the table.

“Please, yes, yes, don’t stop,” she demanded, with barely enough breath to speak, ”Just like thaaahh- Oh, yes, oh, please, unnggh“

Her whole body flushed and her toes curled as she let out several low and guttural groans as I finally satisfied myself. Both the lights and the force holding her down snapped off of their own accord once we got finished with each other, and I let go of her hair and stumbled back as she lay bent over the table, still panting hard. It was almost pitch black without the lights, but I still saw her shadowy outline as she tried and failed to push herself up to her feet. Instead her knees buckled, and she crumpled down to the ground in a heap.

“Quinn,” she pleaded, “Bed, please?”

I scooped her up off of the ground, and dumped her into the bed, before slipping in beside her, still breathing hard from the evening’s exertions.

“You dog,” she panted.

“Problem?” I asked breathily, “Unsatisfied?”

“No, that was perfectly satisfying,” she said, rolling over to press her face to my side, “But my stupid feet are clenched so hard they hurt.”

“Well,” I laughed, “That sounds like success to me.”

“Oh just you wait,” she promised, “Next time you’ll be the one who’s so cross-eyed that they can barely stand.”

# Chapter 52

*Victorina*

-----

Quinn was still sprawled across my bed and sleeping peacefully when I returned from the bathroom, and I slipped under the covers to snuggle up next to him while I considered just what to do with Quinn while he slept. Up until now I’d been using the extra couple of hours Quinn would spend sleeping to take a peek into his dreams. I wanted to try to get a better understanding of both Quinn and the world he’d come from, and so far it had been working well. I did sometimes have a hard time separating the realities of Earth from the disjointed and surreal images that came along with any dream, but I wasn’t likely to get a better understanding of Earth from anywhere else.

It had surprised me actually, the first time I’d cast Dream Viewing. Not the dream itself, I had been expecting something strange after all. No, it was how easy it was to cast the spell in the first place. I’d taken part in some of the practice skirmishes that Halea would run with Quinn, and I knew just how hard it was to actually affect Quinn with a spell that was cast directly on him. It wasn’t quite as difficult as casting on Neferoy, she had a true *Resistance* to magic after all, but it was close, which spoke to the strength of Quinn’s Will. But when I’d cast it that first time, I didn’t feel any resistance at all, which was very much the opposite of what I’d expected.

Most of the time it’s difficult to cast even a healing spell on someone who’s unconscious, since they’re not able to make the decision to let the spell through, whether they make that decision consciously or subconsciously. That meant one of two things for Quinn. The first possibility was that his substantial Will interacted with his magical talent strangely, and produced an incredible amount of natural resistance to incoming magic while conscious, but no natural resistance when unconscious. The other though… The other possibility was that Quinn trusted me to the point, where it was his subconscious response to let my magic through, and it was only when he made a conscious effort that he could resist it.

That was not an easy level of trust to achieve, and it did make me feel just a little bit guilty about my spying. For most elves, though Quinn made me question whether it was the case with humans, their minds were too wrapped up in the what-ifs to allow for such a degree of trust in another person, even if they’d spent decades with that person. Sure, most spells that their partner might cast would be beneficial, but, what if? What if the person they thought they cared for had changed, or wasn’t even the person that they thought they were in the first place? There were too many what-ifs in most people’s minds for that sort of unconditional trust. It wasn’t unheard of, but it was extremely rare.

*And am I going to take advantage of that whenever possible? Oh very much yes.*

I had Dream Viewing, and could try that one again, but I’d taken some time to learn a few of the others, and now felt like as good a time as any to try them out. There was one in particular, a modification of the standard version of Dream Sending, which would give the subject of the spell a particularly erotic experience. It was apparently a favourite of Halea’s, and she’d told me at length of a silk pillowcase that she’d enchanted to cast it on her when she slept.

*Mmm, I wouldn’t mind getting him a little worked up.*

I had something else in mind though, this spell too was a variation on Dream Sending, and it was called Send Nightmare. If Quinn really was unwilling or unable to resist me casting spells on him, then I wanted to know just how far that went. I decided not to pull my punches, and took up one of the rings I’d left on the nightstand before casting Send Nightmare. The ring held a rather large mana stone, and I drained the whole thing to cast the spell. The spell would find out what Quinn feared most in the world, and distil it into its purest form. That was the dream Quinn would experience.

*And then who will he look to for comfort? Well, I’m right here aren’t I?*

I cast the spell, and as I’d guessed, did not meet the wall of resistance that was normally found when trying to cast a spell on another sentient creature. I kept my eyes on Quinn’s face as I focused on keeping the spell together, but didn’t see any immediate signs of discomfort as Quinn slept on. It took some time, and I’d just been starting to think that I might have miscast the spell, when I finally saw the signs I’d been looking for. He’d broken out into a cold sweat, I could see that he’d become much more tense, and it seemed almost like he was trying to force himself awake as he twitched and shook. Finally he managed to snap himself out of it, and woke up, gasping for breath.

“Victorina? Victorina?” he gasped, as he looked around with wild eyes and groped around in the dark with his hands.

“I’m right here Quinn,” I said softly and sweetly, as I pressed my body against his and wrapped my arms around his neck, “What’s wrong? Did you have a Nightmare?” I asked, as I kissed him on the forehead.

“Yeah,” he said hoarsely, and he wrapped his arms around my waist, pulling me in close, “Yeah I did.”

He was shaking almost uncontrollably, and I did my best to comfort him, hugging his head to my chest and making soothing sounds.

“It’s alright Quinn, you’re with me now, you’re safe,” I told him quietly, as I nuzzled his short brown hair.

I crossed my legs around him and just held him gently, while he came down from whatever terror the dream had inflicted.

It was several more minutes before I finally spoke again, “Do you want to tell me about it?” I asked softly.

He turned his face in towards my chest, and let out a long breath, “It was a stupid dream,” he said, somehow almost upset with himself, “I dreamt that I was back on Earth, waking up in a hospital after months of being in a coma.”

*Your greatest fear is being taken away from all of this? From magic? From me?*

“You don’t want to go home?” I asked quietly.

“Fuck no,” he said firmly “Home was fine, my parents were wealthy, and I had a really good job lined up, but what would I have made of myself? What could I have done? Sure, if I worked hard I might have been making six figures by the time I was thirty, or even earlier, but then what? Life on Earth, if you’re lucky enough to be born into a western country, is easy, but boring. Elardia though? Elardia’s not boring, and I might even be able to make something of myself here, rather than being another kid from an upper middle class family, working some boring job for okay money, and spending most of his free time gaming.”

“Make something of yourself… is that why you’re so fixated on lifting the curse?” I asked, “It seems to me as if you’re getting ahead of yourself. It might be better to take things more slowly, try working on some of the other ideas you’ve told me about for example.”

“Maybe,” he hedged, “But much of what I want to do would only really be useful for people in positions of power. Sure, I bet I could knock out a couple of flint locks, which are a couple hundred years more adanced than Uncle Walsh’s match locks, in a couple of weeks. But what would I do with them? I’m a mage, I don’t need a gun. For me to get much use out of most of what I want to create, I’d need to do the work for one ruler or another. If I lift the curse though, well then the ruler I’m doing the work for is me.”

“Ah, and if you were to create these flint lock weapons sooner, then you’d end up sharing them with someone that might become a potential rival.”

“Exactly,” he confirmed, “I mean, maybe it wouldn’t be a big deal to share the weapons with someone like King Nezzabi, since I doubt that I’d end up fighting him, and I suppose that making the jump to metallic cartridges wouldn’t be that hard once I’ve got the guildhall.”

“Actually Quinn, if you do manage to lift the curse and secure the hall, the first person we’re likely to face opposition from will in fact be King Nezzabi.”

“Oh. That sounds bad, why though?” he asked.

“The lands that come along with the guild hall are rather substantial, it’s actually the guild with the most de jure land, and it has at least twice as many as the next largest guild. It has a fraction of the population though, since the half of its land that isn’t covered in thick and ancient forests, is actually most of a mountain range, but it does have exactly one notable city. At the very northern tip of the guild’s lands is a city that’s built across a river delta. The north side of the river is land owned by one of King Nezzabi’s vassals, and the south side is the de jure property of the guild. The delta too, is also the de jure property of the guild,” I explained.

“But the guild hasn’t existed for a thousand years,” he considered, “I’m guessing that Nezzabi, or his vassal, has claimed ownership of the city? And if I claim the guild, then he’s going to see that as a de facto claim on the city? Couldn’t he just trade me something in exchange for me dropping the claim on the city? Why does he even care about one city?”

“It’s a very special city, and a very special situation. Nezzabi’s vassal has laid a claim on the city, but the city has rejected it, on the grounds that it remains a vassal of the guild, and of the university. They have been forced into paying a rather substantial regular tribute, but otherwise have taken great advantage of their thousand years of relative autonomy. Their position helps as well, since nearly all of the trade that Karka does with the rest of Elardia passes through Azarburg, that’s the name of the city, in one way or another. Either their trade ships stop off at the city as they come down the coast, or they pass through the city, via the river Azar.”

“Ah, so I claim the guildhall, and by doing so, the rest of the guild’s lands as well. Azarburg sees this as a great time to stop paying tribute, and tells Nezzabi, or the vassal, to fuck off. This pisses off the vassal, or Nezzabi, and I end up in a big fight.”

“Exactly,” I nodded.

Quinn frowned, “Wouldn’t they need to go after the University as a whole? I mean, I’d be a vassal under the University, and Nezzabi’s vassal would be a vassal under, well, Nezzabi. Wouldn’t Nezzabi’s vassal need to have Nezzabi declare the, well I guess it would be a war, on his behalf? I would have thought that for two vassals to fight, that they’d need to be vassals under the same ruler. And then, if Nezzabi declares for the vassal, wouldn’t he need to declare against the University, since I’d be underneath the University?”

I unwrapped myself from Quinn, and shifted around to rest my head on his chest, “Normally, yes. But the University is a special case. It’s not a true liege lord, not like Nezzabi is. Nezzabi, for example, has lands held directly by himself. The University on the other hand, has no directly held lands. Guilds of the University act much more like direct vassals of the Emperor himself.”

“So the Emperor *could* bring his full weight against me then,” Quinn grimaced, “Damn. I’m gonna need a whole hell of a lot of blackpowder.”

I let out a very unladylike snort, “You’re not dissuaded at all, are you?”

“Nope,” he said, and I could hear the smile in his voice.

“Well, you need not prepare for something of that scale,” I reassured him, “It is as I said, the University is a special case, but that doesn’t mean that Nezzabi can bring his armies to bear against you, and expect that the rest of the University won’t rise to defend itself. No, your problem is that due to the University’s unique position, the aggrieved vassal would be permitted to declare against you, despite the fact that you don’t share the same liege.”

“Well,” he considered, “That does sound an awful lot more manageable. Though I’d expect that Nezzabi is going to lend as much aid as he could.”

“Yes, your uncle’s new weapons for example, and they’re nothing to scoff at Quinn,” I warned, “Nezzabi has been taking any chance he can find to use them, and I’ve heard the reports, and his boasts. They’re as deadly as any bow or crossbow, and while they can’t be made ready nearly as quickly, their wielders can continue to fight much longer.”

“Right, I hadn’t thought of that. A bow might be better than early firearms if the bowman is skilled, but without endurance like a human, they probably can’t keep it up for very long. How many of these guys has he got though? I mean, guns are easy to train on. I might be able to get similar numbers if I hand out flintlocks or even bolt actions to as many of the city’s garrison as I can manage.”

“Fifty perhaps?” I said, “No more than a hundred.”

“Fifty?” Quinn exclaimed, “Fifty? That’s it? Uncle Walsh has been here for how long? Fifty? Man. I am going to roll right over him.”

*Well, he doesn’t lack in confidence.*

“He’s been here for four years, or a little more. And yes, fifty. Why so surprised though?” I asked, “It can’t be simple to create such a weapon, and I know that your Uncle has had trouble producing the gun powder in large enough quantities. I have heard him complain of not having nearly enough saltpetre, I take it that it’s an important ingredient in blackpowder?”

“Yeah, you can mine the stuff, but if they haven’t found a large enough source then they’re probably doing it the hard way, and that’s going to bottleneck their blackpowder production a lot.”

“The hard way?” I asked, “And what else might he need for blackpowder, what if we have similar issues?”

“Uh, well. Given time you can get some saltpetre out of manure piles, but if you’re trying to produce it in quantity, then the process can take as much as a year. The other two ingredients are charcoal and sulphur. Charcoal we can get by burning wood, which is obviously not a difficulty. Sulphur and saltpetre we’d need to mine, which might be a difficulty.”

“Even if we found deposits of the material, getting the mines up and running might take some time,” I agreed.

“Yeah, wouldn’t we be able to buy the stuff though? I mean, that would put us in the same place as Nezzabi, since our deployment of the weapons would be limited by the amount of blackpowder we could produce, but I don’t think that would be too terrible.”

“Yes, we’d be able to purchase it from the same sources that Thera gets her other alchemy ingredients from. Aren’t you concerned that Nezzabi’s men will be better able to use their weapons though?”

“I guess?” he said, “Not that concerned though. One of the greatest advantages to firearms though, is how easy they are to use. On Earth at least, the bow was a better weapon for hundreds of years, but it’s a problem of training. Training an archer can take years, but training someone to use a gun takes only weeks, so most of the advantage comes from the quantity in which you can deploy the weapon. He’s not making nearly enough for them to matter. They’re new, they’re interesting, and they probably scare the hell out of whoever you shoot at, but ultimately, they’re not going to be that much better than a bow. They’ve got one strength, and that’s deployment in quantity, and it’s the one thing he can’t do.”

“Pardon me Quinn, but that doesn’t sound like the problem is solved. If the guns are only a curiosity, then it comes down to a matter of which army has the numbers or skill to overcome the other. The city’s defences will help a great deal, but it’s going to be a Duke and all that he can bring to bear, and all that Nezzabi can provide in assistance without raising notice, against a single city. We could certainly keep the city supplied throughout a siege, but all that does is force Nezzabi into an assault, and once that happens I don’t see us being able to turn that tide. If your own guns are also only curiosities, then I don’t see this as a fight we’d win.”

“You’re right of course, which is why I’ve got to introduce guns that aren’t just going to be a curiosity. I’m going to, or we’re going to, produce better powder, and *much* better guns."

“You have a better formula?” I asked.

“Sort of? It’s a hunch to some extent, but I’m pretty sure he’s making serpentine powder, rather than corned powder, which is what we’d want to make. His mix is probably off too, since he’d be recalling the recipe from memory, and he’s short on saltpetre. He might not even know that pressing and grinding the powder would yield any benefits.”

I smiled, “And you believe that your memory is better? Don’t you think he’s experimented with different formulations?”

“Of course my memory is better,“ Quinn scoffed, “And even if he has experimented a bit, even in four years of work, he might not have made much progress. It’s not going to be a simple thing to measure, so he’d basically be playing it by ear. The main thing though is the guns. That’s what’s going to really set us apart. His guns are interesting, but with only fifty, or even a hundred, he’s not going to make a difference in the siege of a city.”

“But your designs can?” I teased.

“Yup. People always get hung up on blackpowder, oh, how to make it, can you find the ingredients, and what’s the right mix? But the fact is, it’s not the thing that matters, not really,” Quinn grinned, “What really matters, the thing that sets muzzle loaders apart from cartridge firing guns, is Mercury Fulminate. With that, or Lead Azide, I’ll be able to skip a couple hundred years of firearms development and go right for bolt action rifles. Maybe I’ll need to settle for cap and ball weapons, and maybe I’ll need to provide the city with some revolving rifles, but I bet I could make proper self-contained cases, especially with magic to help things along.”

“Quinn, I’m not really sure what any of those things are, but I suppose it’s good that you’re excited.”

He laughed, “I’ll spare you the technical details, but what matters is rate of fire. If I’m right and the powder we produce is better than my Uncle’s, then we will see a not insignificant increase in power, but that’s not really what matters. He could always just cram in more powder and a larger projectile, and get the same output. No, what matters is how long it takes to load and fire the weapons.”

“Twenty seconds,” I supplied, “I counted, last time I met with Nezzabi.”

“Twenty seconds? Well, that’s not bad, not for a muzzle loader. But I can do better. With magazine fed bolt action rifles you’re looking at a shot every second until the magazine is empty, and then six or fewer seconds to reload. Given time to train, the rate of fire could be doubled, and the time to reload reduced even further. With weapons like that, especially from a defensible position, I bet it would make a difference.”

*With weapons like that…*

“Now I understand why you’d rather not share such a creation with others, it makes it almost too easy to kill. In some ways it reminds me of what you created with Magic Missile.”

“Exactly,” he said, “I designed Magic Missile to mimic such weapons, and if I don’t want to hand that spell out to everyone, then I don’t want to hand the guns out to everyone either.”

“It seems like you’ve thought this through,” I said wryly, “Maybe a little too much.”

“Yeah, and with my luck, it’ll be the same as my stupid hands,” he replied, “I’ll go to all this work, and then Nezzabi’ll turn around and say it’s all fine, and in a massive and anticlimactic finish, it will all be solved.”

“I suppose it was awfully nice of her,” I said, despite my own reservations, *but I swear to Verrin, if she tries to get her hooks into him, I’m going to tear her apart.*

“Huh? Her?” He asked, obviously quite confused.

“Nothus,” I repeated, as Quinn’s eyes got wider and wider, “She was the one to fix your hands, wasn’t she?”

“***She?***”

# Chapter 53

**Quinn**

-----

“***She?***”

“Yes, she,” Victorina replied, “You really had no idea, did you?”

“No-” I started, “Hold on, how is she a she? *What* is she?”

“She’s a nymph, and like humans, they’re Outsiders,” Victorina explained, “Though they’ve been present in Elardia long enough that most nymphs you’ll come across are naturally born, rather than true Outsiders.”

“You know,” I said wryly, “When I think ‘nymph’, I don’t imagine something like Nothus.”

“You imagine something like me?” Victorina asked innocently, as she pressed herself hard against me.

“Actually, yeah,” I replied, “Do all nymphs look like Nothus then?”

“Nymphs are shapeshifters,” she replied, and I raised an eyebrow, “It’s not a quick process for them to change shape, but given enough time they can assume almost any elfinoid shape.”

“Can they change their sex?” I asked.

*Maybe Nothus would prefer if I did refer to her as male, and oh holy fuck, that would explain why most people have such a hateon for… them? It’s hard enough on twenty first century earth, I can’t imagine what it would be like in a world like this.*

She seemed slightly unnerved at the idea, and shook her head, “No, as far as I know, all nymphs are women, and they can’t go changing it. Nothus has gotten pretty close, but I’m all but certain that the bits that matter are the same.”

*If all nymphs are female, and difference species can’t mix, how is it that* ***any*** *are born on Elardia?*

“You disapprove I’m guessing?”

Victorina let out a sigh, “I tried to get her to join the club once, back when she looked more like… herself. She used to look spectacular, almost unimaginably beautiful. I don’t have the words to describe it, and even trying to remember what she looked like is hard, some things are just beyond the mind’s ability to perceive. Brandy called her a ‘living Barbie doll’ I think, and she hadn’t seen her until after Nothus had already begun the process of ruining herself.”

“Why the change?” I asked, “Do you know?”

She shook her head, “I have no idea.”

“Would you be against the idea of her joining the club? I mean, you said that you’d tried it once before.”

“That was *before*,” she grimaced, “But yes, I would still like her to be a part of our team. No one matches Nothus in talent, and I suppose I could put up with the political backlash if it meant such an increase in the club’s collective power. I guess that means you’re going to continue spending time around her?”

“Don’t you worry, I’m not about to run off with Nothus,” I told her, as I went exploring under the covers with my hands, “But yeah, I’m not just going to bail on her because some people have a problem with her. Besides, she fixed these,” I said, as I found what I was looking for.

Victorina inhaled sharply, “J-just, be… careful!” she gasped out haltingly, “She-e-e’s an emp-p-path t-too.”

“I’ll be careful,” I promised, “I’m not about to let anyone go digging around in my head.”

-----

I made breakfast that morning for Victorina and a couple of the others who’d also risen a little late, before finally heading out for the Library. I had something like a real deadline for lifting the curse now and needed to prepare, and I also wanted to do some reading on nymphs.

I couldn’t say that I liked Victorina’s attitude towards Nothus, but I supposed that I did need to make allowances for the fact that she was a product of her time, or at least of this world. That was something I’d been noticing more and more as we both relaxed into the relationship a little. We’d passed the initial heated and possibly overly affectionate phase that came at the start of any relationship, especially one that had been preceded by a rather long dry spell, as had been the case for the both of us, and we were getting to grips with the realities of a longer term commitment. There were a lot of cultural differences between us, some of which I’d never imagined, and others which I’d given very little thought until now, and it took some getting used to.

Whether I liked the attitude though, she was right about being careful around Nothus, and I needed more information. For me the word ‘empath’ was loaded with baggage, borne of living in a world with an excessive amount of entertainment material to watch, read, and listen to, and I needed to know what ‘empath’ really meant on Elardia if I was going to be able to safely interact with Nothus.

And there was the guildhall, and the potential conflict with Nezzabi or one of his vassals. If he was going to make an issue of it, then he’d want to do it as quickly as possible, to minimize the amount of time I’d have to prepare for the defence of the city. He’d be limited though, because even with my Uncle’s matchlocks, he still had to deal with the realities of trying to prosecute a war in a late Bronze, early Iron age society. In a world like this the campaigning season was very short, four months at most, and more probably three. Even with magic, supplying an army in winter was still going to be nearly impossible, which discounted one entire season. Spring and Autumn too, were also out, as elves would be busy with either planting or harvesting the crops for the year.

*Which might even take longer than it did on Earth if elves can only work half as long.*

That left Summer. The crops would be planted, and the harvest would be months away. It would be warm, and the levies could be raised to march on the city. So I had until the start of Summer to break into the restricted section, find the spells I’d need, lift the curse, claim the hall, and prepare the defence.

*I might be rushing a little, but I think that this is doable.*

I could wait. I could take my time, break in at some point this year and get the spells, but wait until very late Summer next year to actually do the work of lifting the curse. That could work, but that plan had its flaws. As it was, we weren’t even a week into Autumn as it was, so I wouldn’t be buying myself more than a month or two of extra time to work. And while I might get a couple extra months to prepare by waiting a year, Uncle Walsh would be able to spend that year refining his designs and stockpiling gunpowder. For all I knew, that year would be all he needed to find a more substantial source of saltpetre.

*Assuming he is my Uncle, if he’s really been here for four years then there’s a whole mess there to be figured out.*

Haste then was the better option. A month or two of lost time was worth depriving my Uncle, *or a near copy*, of a year’s worth of firearms development.

-----

The information to be found on nymphs was unfortunately rather thin, though I did get some bullet point answers to some of the biggest questions. My question about how nymphs propagated themselves without any male nymphs around was answered pretty simply, nymphs were apparently the exception to the rule that species couldn’t interbreed. It was speculated that it was something to do with their shapeshifting, and apparently any child of a nymph regardless of the species of the other parent, was always a nymph. There was more on nymph reproduction to be found, in fact of all the nymph related topics it was the most well covered, but the strange sort of voyeuristic fascination that the sections seemed to be written with put me off, and I moved on.

Nymph empathy turned out to be pretty simple, and I was almost disappointed in how it seemed to be more or less as my cultural assumptions had led me to think it would be. Nymphs could sense emotions. That was it. They didn’t get thoughts, not of any kind, but they’d be able to pick up on the presence and intensity of any given emotion. They were apparently pretty flawless lie detectors, which made them prized companions of royalty who wanted an edge on anyone they were meeting with.

*On top of the obvious benefits of having mistress of unearthly beauty, with the ability to shapeshift into whichever form you most preferred.*

They could never be anything more than a mistress though, not a concubine, and certainly not a wife. This was because any offspring of a nymph was automatically illegitimate. Nobles and royalty wanted heirs for their dynasty, and what good was an heir that wasn’t even the same species as you?

It didn’t quite explain Nothus though, and whatever little Victorina knew she seemed uncomfortable sharing, which probably meant asking Nothus themself next time I saw them.

I dug a little more into the specifics of their shapeshifting abilities, but nymphs seemed to be pretty tight lipped when it came to this part of their abilities, and there wasn’t a whole lot of information to be found. This was somewhat disappointing, as I was hoping that it might be the clue that I needed to fix my eyes. It was only a guess, but I was pretty sure that Nothus was able to heal my hands because they had an innate understanding of just how the body worked. If they’d had only the MRI spell, all they would have known would have been that there was some sort of odd fibre running through my hands that had been damaged beyond repair. They wouldn’t have known what those fibres were, or how they related to the feeling in my hands, only that they were damaged. It was only due to their ability to shapeshift that they understood how to fix the damage.

*And it would explain more of the desire Nothus has to learn more about healing magic. They’ve got all the natural talent and intuition in the world, but are a little short on the academic theory.*

-----

I spent the morning and most of that afternoon in the Library, flipping through books on nymphs, Banestorms, Outsiders, and maps of the Ariros guild lands, and only left around three o’clock when I finally realized that I should probably eat lunch at some point.

Or at least, I tried to leave.

I saw, as I approached the entrance, that in the hours I’d spent in the Library, someone had taken the time set up several tables in the lobby, and all manner of books were laid out across them. There were several other Mages in the lobby already, either perusing the books, or listening to the small and thin elf giving something like a speech. It was the sort of masturbatory self-congratulatory nonsense that was the favourite of university administrators from any dimension, and he was patting himself on the back and explaining how it was such a spectacular achievement for this particular collection of books to finally be ‘rescued from the depths of obscurity’ and ‘brought into the light of a proper sorting system’.

They’d evidently added these books to the Library’s magical filing system, and I fully intended to look at them *later*, after I’d had something to eat, and after the annoying man had stopped talking. And then I glanced at one of the covers as I walked by one of the tables.

‘Aiumardu’s Advanced Astrology’, the title proclaimed.

I stopped dead in my tracks, and turned to stare at the cover of the book.

*No. I refuse.*

I glanced around, to check to see if the other Mages looking at the collection were handling the books, before flipping the cover open.

“This text is intended for the student already familiar with the basics of Divination magic, and the fundamentals of Astrology,” the book read, “It details how a Mage or Wizard might the divine events of the past or future by observation of the…”

*No god dammit, this is nonsense. I don’t care if magic is real, astrology doesn’t get to be real in* ***any*** *dimension.*

It wasn’t the only book on Astrology though, and it wasn’t just a collection of Astrology texts either. This was a small sample of the Library’s entire collection on Divination, and it was the sorting and filing of this collection that the elf talking was congratulating himself for. There would of course be more of the collection left unsorted, lost in the mess of the massive building, but he claimed that nine out of ten of the Library’s Divination collection had been found and filed.

I glanced at the first couple paged of the Astrology book, which seemed to describe something like what I’d seen printed in Earth newspapers, though the texts I saw seemed to take it all as fact.

*But then so do some Astrologists on Earth, doesn’t mean they’re right either. But thanks world, an existential crisis is exactly the sort of thing I need right now.*

Elardia played by different rules than Earth. For one, magic was real, and it could even be used to conjure matter from thin air, even if it was only for a short time. If the laws of physics were so flexible here that e=mc^2 could be interpreted a little liberally, then maybe Astrology or any other sort of Divination magic really did give accurate results. And if Divination really did give accurate results, then what did that say about free will?

*If I learn Astrology, and use it to divine the future, am I locked into that future? If I don’t use it, would I still find myself following that course of events? Is not knowing about a prophecy the same as not being bound by one? Is ignorance bliss? Well, maybe, but I doubt that ignorance is going to be the solution to any of my problems.*

I went back up the stairs, and tracked down the larger portion of the collection that was no so maligned by the presence of an administrator with an inflated sense of self-worth.

-----

The books here had the same look and feel of the books elsewhere in the Library, but the room itself felt much different. The divination collection had all been packed into a single room. The shelves had the look of fresh construction, and instead of the normal musty scent that the Library had, I was assaulted by the smell of recently sawn lumber and wood stain. The room itself had once been a quite large lecture hall, which meant that while it certainly didn’t feel cramped, it was a little disconcerting to be trying to explore a library that had been built on top of what was basically a very large staircase. I found myself being very careful as I picked books up off of shelves, for fear of knocking one at the top over, and having them all cascade like the world’s most expensive set of dominoes.

More than anything else the bit of information that led me to believe that this stuff might be for real, as I flipped through various texts, was that each book tended to contain at least one spell. In Astrology for example, it wasn’t enough to look up at the stars and make some sort of decision after having a deep think about it, you needed to use the proper spell or spells to get your answer.

I took several photos of each spell, along with brief notes on what sort of divination magic it was for, and just how that divination magic was supposed to work. And oh man, there were about a million different varieties.

There was Astrology, which could be used to look both forwards or backwards, though it was applied differently than it was on earth, despite my initial conclusions. You couldn’t just look up at the stars and determine how things would be now, or very shortly in the future. There were no daily horoscopes with lucky numbers or recommendations on how you should spend your day. Astrology was best used for events far in the future or far in the past, ‘far’ in this case meaning years, and supposedly gave only very general information. A prediction for events even a month out was supposed to be incredibly difficult to do accurately, and one year of lead time seemed to be the minimum for practical use.

*Practical use. Of Astrology. Fucking hell, do they know that the movement of stars and planets are fixed?*

A relative of Astrology was Meteorology, which had the Mage observing weather patterns, instead of the stars. Like Astrology it was used best when attempting longer term predictions, though longer term for Meteorology meant months instead of years in this case. The texts on one subject tended to reference the other, and it was supposedly possible to use the two together to get more accurate predictions.

*Note to self, figure out magical spaceflight and launch a weather satellite.*

There was Catoptromancy and Pyromancy, both of which involved seeing images of future events, or hearing voices that would speak the answer to your questions, the only difference between the two was whether you were starting into a mirror, or a fire. There was Xylomancy, Astragalomancy, and Pessomancy, which based their divination on the fall of sticks, bones, and stones respectively. There was tea leaf reading, and crystal gazing, Lecanomancy and Geomancy. I tried counting all the different methods of divination as I wandered through the collection, and stopped when I reached a hundred. There must have been four or five times that many, just in this collection, with each one having its own particular uses or specialties.

It would take me years, even as talented as I was, just to learn all the spells, let alone figure out how and when to use them. I could feel the obsessive part of brain trying to convince the rest that it would be a good idea to sit down and start trying to do just that, but after photographing what must have been the fiftieth divination spell, I decided that it would be best to pick just one.

*At least for now.*

I needed to pick one that I could examine scientifically, but then there was the question, how? How could I examine any sort of fortune telling in a scientific manner, when fortune telling on its own was unscientific?

*I don’t suppose the next Banestorm could drop off James Randi?*

Maybe I could pick a method that’s easy to do frequently, and keep track of how often it got it right? With a large enough sample size I’d be able to get an idea of just how often my divinations turned out to be correct. Anything more than a few percentage points above 55% would indicate that *something* was going on. The problem with that though was twofold. First was the sample size, I’d need to do a hell of a lot of divinations to get enough data. The second was adjudicating whether an outcome was ‘true’ or not, and with something as slippery as fortune telling who could tell what was an actual success, and what was simply a statement interpreted broadly enough to be interpreted as true. I didn’t want to put myself in the position of essentially cold reading myself.

I was browsing idly, considering the possibility of doing some sort of statistical analysis on Astragalomancy and browsing the titles of the books along one shelf, when I came to one particular book that had its title written in two different languages. It was written once in English, *assuming that I’m still speaking English and that the Banestorm didn’t rewire the language centre of my brain,* and once in some sort of runic language.

‘Symbol Drawing and Symbol Casting for the Journeyman Spellcaster’ the title read, and I pulled it off the shelf. The title was repeated on the front cover, both in probably-English and in the runic alphabet, and set behind the title was a rune which was embossed across the cover. At least, I was pretty sure it was meant to be a rune, but it might just have been a fancy X.

Symbol Drawing turned out to be very similar to Cartomancy, in that they both involved the interpretation of whichever cards or symbols were drawn, but there were some important differences. Symbol drawing could be done much more quickly than Cartomancy for one, since Cartomancy essentially required the caster to sit down and play a magical game of solitaire in order to cast the spell. Symbol drawing could take just as much time, if you wanted to divine something further into the future, but that wasn’t a necessity. Of all the divination methods I’d scanned through so far, symbol drawing seemed to be both the fastest, and the one that was most useful for very short term predictions. How fast, and how short term? Well, I could cast the spell for Symbol Drawing as quickly as I could cast Apportation, and the ritual that accompanied the spell was as simple as reaching into a bag that contained a rune for every symbol, and drawing one or more out. Supposedly then, that could be the answer or warning I needed for a question as simple as ‘which path do I take.’ Like Cartomancy there was still some interpretation involved in reading the symbols that were drawn, but it was much less situational, and the meanings didn’t change depending on the person or thing that was being asked about. ᛪ was the symbol for Spirit, and would always be the symbol for Spirit, and there was no nonsense about trying to figure out what the hell the Tower card is supposed to mean in this particular situation.

The speed also lent itself to practical use, and it meant that it would be easier to get a large enough sample size. Actually studying the sample size would also be easier, since I wouldn’t need to worry about whether the divination came true or not. I’d just track the frequency by which each symbol appeared, and if I was deviating significantly enough from the mean, then I’d know that something was up.

*Great, one more thing on my already massive to do list.*

I photographed the hell out of that book, since my scanner app couldn’t parse the odd symbols, before finally managing to escape the Library for the day, and I went off to find something to eat to stave off starvation.

-----

I spent the rest of that week going through the information that the Library kept on the guildhall, its lands, and on Duke Suila. Duke Suila being the guy who I’d eventually be coming into conflict with. Assuming I could break into the tower without getting caught or falling to my death, lift the curse without getting eaten by the wraith or killing myself in the casting of some very questionable spells, and claim the guildhall without anyone crying foul.

*And also assuming that Azarburg even wants my help, for all I know they might not want my help against Duke Sulia, or they’ll be happy with actually becoming a proper vassal of Sulia if it would avert a war.*

In the afternoon each day I’d also go for a run, though the forests north of the city that I hoped would eventually be my personal property. I was still in great shape, despite not having done any proper exercise in the past few months, but I needed to be ready for a six story climb up what was basically a sheer cliff with minimal hand holds. I’d done a bit of climbing while back on Earth, but never very much, and it was always on an indoor climbing wall. Climbing the tower would be a different matter entirely. Even on the more difficult climbing walls, the handholds were *designed* to be handholds, it was well lit, there was usually a person or machine belaying you, and there was a great deal of safety equipment. I’d have none of that, and I’d need to do it at night.

*This can only go well.*

So I climbed trees. It did make me feel slightly juvenile, and it wasn’t quite the same as the tower, but it worked the right muscles. I also needed to get used to using my hands again. They gotten pretty soft after a couple of months of not using them, and while Victorina seemed to appreciate it, that wasn’t going to do me any good while I was trying to scale the tower.

------

The following week was the first with proper classes, and I found that I quite enjoyed them. Battlemagic was interesting, though not terribly taxing mentally. This was an introductory class after all, which meant that some of the people present hadn’t ever been in a fight, whether that fight had been in the arena or not. There was some stuff about defensive magic that I found interesting, but largely it was a matter of waiting for the other students to catch up.

*What else is new?*

In invention the work on the modified version of Solaris progressed somewhat slowly, and I spent most of the two 4 hour sessions going over the theory behind what it is I had planned. Diova and his little clique were a surprisingly attentive group, though I imagine that had something to do with the fact that I was dispensing as yet unknown knowledge to them. I still didn’t have Mata quite figured out, and she mostly seemed to exist to take notes for Diova.

*Are they sleeping together? Maybe I’m just an asshole, but if I was going to put the royal arm lock on someone to coerce them into sleeping with me then I’d probably pick someone a little less… bland.*

I got thrown not one but two reality redefining curveballs in my enchantment class that week, and the professor eventually had to institute a rule against anyone laughing manically in class. The first curveball was that it was possible to cast an enchantment that did nothing other than turn mana into heat, and while I should have guessed that from the existence of Fireball, it was a different matter entirely to have it confirmed. The other was that it was possible to shrink objects or **people** with both enchantments and spells. Why would anyone want to do such a thing? Because fuck thermodynamics, that’s why.

Finally though, it came time for my Healing class, and my next chance to speak to Nothus.

------

I didn’t ask any personal questions or broach any touchy subjects during the class, but judging from their glances, Nothus must have noticed that something was up. The teacher assigned some minor homework though, which gave us an excuse to stick together after class.

“What is it Quinn?” Nothus asked wryly as we left the classroom.

It was odd, being the shorter one, I wasn’t used to that.

“Why does there need to be anything?” I replied playfully.

“Really?” they replied, “Because it was pretty quiet in there last time, but today in class it was like a tree full of chattering squirrels.”

“There referring to my head?” I asked.

“Yes,” they replied, and they must have picked up on something because they missed a step as we were walking and glanced at me sharply, “Oh… you didn’t know, did you?”

“That you were a nymph? No, not until after that first class.”

“Is it a problem?”

I shrugged, “Should it be? I’m not too bothered by the empath thing if that’s what you mean.”

“What about the other thing?” they asked.

“The being a giant thing? Not really bothered by it,” I replied honestly, “Though it’s a strange feeling to need to look up to anyone.”

They seemed satisfied by this, which I suppose made sense, since they’d know if I was sincere or not.

“You’re curious though,” they said wryly, “Of all the stuff that’s going on in there, that’s the only thing that’s at full volume.”

“Yeah I’m curious,” I grinned, “Let’s find somewhere to eat and do this stupid homework so you can tell me about it.”

-----

We found somewhere quiet and out of the way, Nothus having expressed a desire to be around as few people as possible, something that I wholeheartedly agreed with.

“Alright, you may begin the interrogation,” they said in an amused tone, once we’d collected our food and taken a seat.

*Where to start?*

“You’ve alluded to the fact that it’s quiet in here?” I asked, tapping a temple with one finger, “What do you mean? Is that also the case for other humans?”

“Like Andrew?” they asked, “No, it’s just you so far. I don’t really know how to describe it though. Maybe you’ve read this somewhere already, but I can tell what someone is feeling, along with how strongly they’re feeling it. With you though, it’s like everything is under a thick blanket. Even in class, while I guess you were thinking of everything you wanted to quiz me about, it was still all very muted. There were even points where I couldn’t pick up anything, though that was only when you were listening to the lecture or working on something.”

“Is that odd?” I asked.

They nodded, “I always get *something* Quinn, or at least I thought that was the case. You seem to be a pretty big exception to that rule,” they explained, “I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to unsettle you.”

I shrugged, “I don’t suppose it’s unexpected. But having someone confirm it for me is just a little strange.”

“Well, I appreciate it,” they said, “It’s almost unbearably loud in the classroom, and even being around one or two other people is usually a burden, like someone talking endless nonsense in a voice that’s just a bit too loud, right beside your ear.”

“Well I suppose that’s some consolation,” I smiled, “What about the giant routine then?”

Their expression grew a little grim, and a little cool, “Freedom, it’s as simple as that.”

“Oh?”

 “I’m the most talented Mage in the University, Quinn. That’s not a boast, that’s a fact, but even that can be taken away. An Adympian slave collar, or an antimagic field, and it’s all worthless,” Nothus balled up one massive fist, “This though, this can’t be taken away. I am *strong*, stronger than any elf, human, dwarf, or orc. The way I’ve designed this form, I’m probably stronger even than most giants. I used to focus on making myself more beautiful, more desirable. I wanted to be able to push a man beyond the point of reason with nothing more than a glance and bring him to his knees with a twitch of a finger, and I could, and I did. It was an uncanny power, and power is freedom. As long as I said the right things, and looked and acted the right way, I could make people do what I wanted. I could make them help me, or give me what I needed, but it wasn’t the power I thought it was. I was acting and looking as others wanted me to look and act, and I was saying the things that other people wanted me to say. I was still constrained. And worse still, that sort of power is only power as long as someone else isn’t willing to use their own power against you. All the beauty in the world doesn’t help if someone is strong enough, and cruel enough, to take it for himself. It all comes down to strength in the end,” they said coldly, “Which is why I stopped wasting my time. Now I can look how I like, act how I like, and say as I like, and my power doesn’t diminish one bit. I don’t care if it’s meant that I’ve been ostracised, because now if someone doesn’t like me, I don’t need to waste my time to try to change that. If it comes down to it, I can do it on my own, whatever it might be. I’m the strongest, magically and physically, and if someone wants to hurt me, or take something away from me, then good damn luck trying it.”

*Dayum.*

“Well,” I said, leaning back a little, “You’re on the list.”

“List of what?” Nothus asked, the confusion detracting a little from the head of steam they’d built up.

“The list of people not to fuck with,” I replied.

“You’re impressed,” they stated, “Wait, you’re impressed?” they asked.

“Was that not the reaction you were expecting?”

“Well I don’t rightly know what I was expecting,” they replied, “I’ve been working on that whole speech for ages now, but that was the first opportunity I’ve had to actually get it all out.”

I smiled, “It certainly gets the point across. I have just one other question then.”

“Go ahead,” they nodded.

“So you’re not doing all of this because you’d prefer to be male?” I asked hesitantly.

“What?” she exclaimed, “No!”

**Quinn’s Notes**

-----

Monday/Louday

* Battle Magic from 0700 to 1100, Spell invention from 1300 to 1700
* Usually get out early though, really only need to stick around for first hour of spell invention, then we can go wherever to work on the Solaris upgrade
* Elves call it Louday, named for Loupismus, who’s their god of the moon or whatever
* Moon looks normal sized I guess? Crater patterns are different, but a moon is a moon. It’s cold, dead, and probably not made of cheese

Tuesday/Tupiday

* Same class schedule as Monday/Louday
* Locals call it Tupiday, the god it’s named for is drawn like one of the Inevitables from the MM
* Elves also name planets after gods, (gotta build telescope or buy better hawk amulet)
* Tupi-whatever’s planet is pretty visible on most nights, (Closer to sun?), and shines whitish, looks awfuly bright, even moreso than Venus does on Earth
* Supposed to be really big and close to the sun, though I don’t know how much I trust the local Astronomers if they’re too busy trying to predict the future
* Didn’t newton invent calculus so he could describe the movement of planets? Yet another way I can do world dominationy things with math
* (From roman numerals, to calculus, I am amazing)

Wednesday/Weiday

* Enchantment 7-11, Healing 13-17
* Locals call it Weiday, named for Weisse, god of wizards
* Not the god of mages too?
* Depicted like a tall old woman
* Weisse’s planet shines blue (!!!!!!!!!)
* Associated with some sort of doomsday shit?
* Planet supposedly comes super close and messes with tides, massive tsunamis, etc (wtf?)
* Could mean any number of things, gonna need to do some of my own orbital observations because the texts I’ve found say that Weisse’s orbit is even more strange then the rest.
* “Strange” probably because they don’t know about Heliocentrism, but doesn’t explain why Weisse is any more strange than the others (Elliptical orbit?)

Thursday/Theriday

* Same schedule as Wenesday/Weiday
* Locals call it Theriday, named for Therioceph
* He’s drawn a whole bunch of different ways, always a humanoid with the head of an animal
* God of the wilds / god of the hunt
* His planet is super weird, and supposedly changes colour regularly (wtf?)
* Pretty shiny I guess? Just looks whiteish right now though (Get better hawk vision, or make telescope)

Friday/Fextday

* No class, spend the time working on curse plan, maybe see about making some guns?
* Could chuck them into a portable hole to have them ready when I lift this stupid thing
* Locals call it Fextday, named for Fext
* Fext is a vampire except not
* Also lower case fexts exist? And they’re also vampires except not?
* Not afraid of sunlight or garlic, etc (Which is just great)
* God of death (Obviously)
* Planet is supposedly dim, couldn’t find it even with hawk vision, sounds like a large outer solar system gas giant though

Saturday/Satyrday

* Also no class, work on plans for world domination, etc, etc (Also trains)
* Called Satyrday, named for Satyrus, who is an ape lady
* Walks upright, god of life
* Almost like a proto-human, (proto-elf I guess)
* Do elves believe in/know about evolution? (Which would take forevers if a generation is hundreds of years long)
* Planet sounds similar to Fext, also probably an outer solar system gas giant

Sunday/Feastday

* Still no class, continue work on Bad Ideas
* Just called Feastday by the locals
* Seems like an awful lot of feasting if they’re doing it every week
* No sun worship?

**Quinn**

-----

It didn’t take long for Nothus to teach me her MRI spell, and once she did, oh man… We both still had a great deal to learn about the theory around healing magic, but when it came to the practical use, we probably advanced the state of healing magic by decades in a matter of days. Between her MRI spell and innate knowledge, and the general sort of knowledge I’d been able to pick up just by living in a world with proper medical technology we’d been able to solve most of the problems that healing magic had up till this point. Previously healing magic had been limited to bones, muscles, and flesh, and even then it could be tricky to heal an injury without leaving some sort of permanent damage, even if it was only a scar. Now though, and this was still just theory to some extent, we were pretty sure that we’d be able to heal something even as complex as the brain or the heart, without leaving any sign of previous damage.

Honestly, Nothus had already done most of the work by the time I'd met her. She was already able to heal most things completely, and only had any real trouble with internal organs. So we ran a complete scan of each of us with her MRI spell, and I pointed out each organ and explained what it was, and what it did. A medical student probably would have been a better pick for this sort of thing than a comp sci major, but I had a pretty good memory, and there wasn’t anything that she pointed out that I couldn’t explain in at least some detail.

The next thing to do then, was to share it. If it had been any other sort of magic I think that the two of us would have tried to sell the knowledge to whomever was willing to pay the most. With healing magic though, it just felt wrong. Being Canadian I was already used to the idea that people shouldn’t be expected to pay huge sums just so that they might be able to survive, and Nothus didn’t need much convincing either.

But dammit, they just didn’t get it. We tried our best, hell, we started with Professor Nanna, but it just wouldn’t click with anyone else. Some of the blame had to lie with us I suppose, since we were both trying to explain something that we only really had an intuitive understanding of, which always made teaching difficult, but it was still rather frustrating to be unable to get the point across. The knowledge we had could have done so much good, but when that knowledge was limited to only two people, it may as well have been useless. At least Professor Nanna took us seriously, which was some sort of consolation. Most of our classmates seemed to think that we were making it all up.

“So what now Quinn?” Nothus asked me, as we left class on Theriday, having utterly failed in explaining our theories to anyone, “I was expecting it to take a lot longer to revolutionize how healing spells are applied.”

“You’re wondering what to do with the rest of the year?” I laughed, “Well there is still class to go to you know.”

“Class is boring,” she replied, “It takes ages for the professor to get to anything I don’t already know, and when she does, it’s barely a footnote.”

“We could see about getting put into a more difficult class I suppose,” I mused, “It’s just too bad that there aren’t really any dedicated theory classes.”

“I wish we could just find a teacher willing to tutor us separately,” she said, as she ducked under the doorway as we stepped out onto the street.

“Wait, why can’t we do that?” I asked, “That sounds kinda like the only option here.”

“Well maybe you could find a teacher like that, but I’m not going to be able to.”

*Right.*

“I’ll see if Lili might be willing, and even if Professor Nanna is too busy to do it, you might check to see how much your own club mentor knows about healing magic.”

Nothus glanced down at me, and the look she was wearing did not seem particularly positive, “I’m not in a club.”

*Oh.*

“Uh, well would you like to be in one?” I asked.

“I…” she grimaced, “I think I’ll stay on my own for now.”

“Alright, well I guess I understand.”

“Thanks Quinn,” she said, “But that still leaves the question of what to do with the rest of the semester.”

“You’re hoping I’ve got some more Outsider knowledge that we can apply to magic?” I asked wryly.

“Maybe,” she smirked.

“Well, how about I tell you a little bit about something called a vaccine.”

-----

“Quinn!” Neferoy called from the dining room, “Have you learned how to enchant manastones or what?”

I went to the doorway, using my manipulators to continue prepping supper while I answered her question, “No, hasn’t come up in class yet.”

“I thought you were working ahead?” Kennocha asked.

“I was,” I answered, “I am, just got side tracked. First I was trying to turn that rotational energy enchantment around, and when that didn’t work I started experimenting with the shrinking spells.”

“Mmm, think you’re a bit *too* big?” Halea asked.

I rolled my eyes, “I’m not casting the spell on myself. I wanted to see what happened when something that had been shrunk ended up in an antimagic field.”

“It returns to full size, unless the effect was enchanted to be wholly permanent,” Neferoy said, “Why did you need to bother testing that? I’m pretty sure that’s in the first paragraph on the damn spell.”

“Well-“ I started, “Ah, hold on,” I said, as the pasta started to boil over, “Just let me dish supper.”

-----

It took me a couple of minutes to get supper on the table, but finally I managed to continue my explanation.

“What I want is some sort of backup plan,” I explained, “If I step into an antimagic field, I don’t want to be rendered defenceless.”

“I can certainly understand that Quinn,” Halea said, “But where does the shrinking come in?”

“When you shrink something, its mass gets reduced,” I said, *because the laws of thermodynamics are optional now I guess,* “We all know that. And this could potentially let you carry around a carriage or whatever in your pocket.”

“Or a kitchen?” Victorina asked, eyebrow raised.

“You’re referring to my Portable Hole?” I asked, “Well yeah, most of the time an Extradimensional Space enchantment is going to be better for storing stuff. It’s more energy efficient, and you store whatever you want, instead of casting the shrinking spell on each individual object. But the moment you step into an antimagic field, anything inside is inaccessible.”

“Ah, so you wanted to see if you could carry something like a sword,” Halea said, “And have it grow back to full size the moment you step into a field.”

“Exactly,” I nodded, “Though I was thinking more of a crossbow, but yes. My only concern was just *how* something grows back to full size. I don’t want the thing hurting me as it suddenly expands back to full size.”

“Does the trick work?” Neferoy asked.

“Mostly?” I hedged, “For whatever reason, the spell will shrink the crossbow, or the bolt, but not both. Even if the crossbow is loaded, the bolt stays at full size as the crossbow shrinks down.”

“I was wondering why you were throwing away so many ruined crossbows,” Victorina teased.

“It doesn’t make any sense to me,” I sighed, “The crossbow is just a collection of otherwise separate parts, and I can shrink a bundle of bolts just fine, and each of them is clearly a distinct object. But I can’t get both the crossbow and the ammo to shrink at once.”

“You could just enchant the items separately,” Neferoy said, before pausing to take a sip of her wine, “Or tweak the enchantment so that it works the way you think it should.”

“That’s what I’m working on now,” I agreed.

“Well, stopit,” Neferoy chastised, though there was humour in her voice, “Victorina told me about how much enervation you’ve got to throw around. Learn the damn Manastone enchantment so we can see about making a bunch.”

“Alright, alright,” I conceded, “Aren’t there any other enchantments we could work on in the meantime though? Ones where it won’t increase the risk of a Fumble too much if I don’t actually know the spell?”

“Fumble?” Kennocha asked, with furrowed brows.

“Mishap, whatever,” I said, “An armouring enchantment or something?”

“Even that needs to be done in layers,” Neferoy said, with a shake of her head, “And with enough layers, the chances that at least one of the castings will be a failure adds up.”

“What about something simpler than that?” Victorina asked, turning to Neferoy, “An enchantment that isn’t cast in layers.”

“There’s plenty, but it’s all just simple stuff. And you were the one that told me we needed to work on something that would bring in some proper money,” Neferoy replied, “It’s just not worth the time it would take.”

“Its fine, it won’t take me that long to get a proper grasp of the spell. I’ll start on it after dinner,” I promised, “My Antman impersonation can wait.”

“Antman?” I was asked, by about everyone at once.

“You know what, Manastone after, movie night first.”

-----

Most of the others didn’t really understand much of what was going on, but it seemed at least like everyone had a fun time. I’d been wanting to have a movie night since I figured out how to magnify my phone’s screen with an illusion, and this had been a good opportunity. Brandy especially seemed to enjoy it, and she seemed noticeably more… relaxed I guess? After having had watched it.

“Hey Quinn?” she asked, once the others had packed up for the night, “Thanks. It was like, super great and everything.”

“You’re welcome,” I smiled, “That is the one thing I miss about Earth, no more Marvel movies, and no more video games.”

“Really? Just movies and games?” she asked, and while her long hair hid her face as she looked down at the floor, I could see that tell that she was pretty serious about this.

“Pretty much, yeah,” I responded, “I’m not really a people person Brandy. I guess I miss my family, but it doesn’t really bother me. I’m not like most people though Brandy, I don’t think I’m a very good person to judge yourself by.”

She nodded slowly, before speaking “So if someone offered you the chance to go home, would you take it?”

“Fuck no,” I said firmly, “I go back to Earth and I’m just a boring computer nerd lost in a sea of other boring computer nerds. Here on Elardia, I can actually make a difference.”

“You’re lucky,” she said, not quite holding back tears, “At least you know stuff. I don’t know anything useful. The only thing I could have done was tell Vicky all about the number stuff, and I didn’t even know that was important until after you explained it all, way better than I ever could,” she sighed a heavy sigh, and it threatened to become a sob, “I just hate everything and want to go home. I’m never going to see anyone I ever cared about ever again. My boyfriend, my mom, my dad, my sisters, and all my friends, it’s like the Banestorm just came through and just fucking killed them all,” then she did start to cry.

It wasn’t a lot, no moaning sobs, no wailing, but I could see some gentle tears streaming down her cheeks, “This is all bullshit, it’s not fair. Doesn’t it make you sad Quinn? How can you just keep on going like nothing’s happened?” she demanded.

“I don’t know,” I said honestly.

I didn’t really even know what to say to her, she was sad, sure, but it was not as if life had been hard on her. She’d lived a privileged life before, more so than most westerners, and more so even than me, and I knew that I’d had it pretty good back on Earth. And it wasn’t like her life now was any less privileged. Not only had she been picked up within hours of landing here, while I’d risked my freedom and my life to get here, she also had power and money dropped into her lap. The number of people at the University with more magical talent than her could be counted on two fifths of one hand, and with that magical talent had come a hell of a lot of money. She had the power to remake reality, and was paid in a month, what the average elf wouldn’t earn in a decade.

*And she’s bitching about needing to find a new boyfriend?*

“Don’t you care?” she asked, and I wasn’t sure if she was asking about her own losses, or mine.

At a loss for words, I just shrugged.

“What is *wrong* with you?” she asked angrily, before standing up from the couch, and storming out of the room.

“I don’t know.”


# Chapter 55

**Victorina**

-----

So Quinn managed to spend a whole week hurting himself.

It started innocently enough of course, though Quinn’s attitude to the whole situation should have served to warn me that he was a little more reckless than the humans I was used to.

*At least Thera only tried to burn the clubhouse down just the once.*

It was late in the evening and I’d just finished going over some of the club’s books with Ken. We were relaxing in the sitting room, and Halea and Brandy had joined us as we enjoyed a quiet glass of wine. It was something of an oddity actually, as Brandy was usually very chatty, but she’d seemed much more pensive since watching Quinn’s movie about the thief with the magic suit. I found myself enjoying the relative silence, and while I didn’t dislike Brandy, I did find her constant chittering a little grating on the ears.

Our quiet revelry was interrupted though, by a dull thump from above, a muffled cry, and a loud crack from the balcony outside, and then another dull thump.

Halea glanced up at the window, and then to me, “Is it just me, or did anyone else hear someone fall off the roof just then?”

“Who would be stupid enough to be climbing around on the roof in the middle of the night?” I wondered aloud, as I set aside my goblet and walked to the balcony doors.

I heard a groan as I pushed the doors open, and peered out over the railing to see someone laying in a heap on the ground below.

“Quinn?” I exclaimed.

“Hi,” he groaned.

“What in the name of,” I muttered, “Hold on, I’ll be right down.”

“What the fext was he doing up there?” Halea asked, as I stepped back inside.

“How should I know,” I shrugged, “Come on, I think he’s hurt himself.”

“I’ll say,” she replied, as the two of us hurried out of the sitting room and down the stairs.

I cast Light as I stepped out into the grassy yard behind the clubhouse, an in the steady blue-white glow I saw Quinn still lying there, with one arm and one leg clearly very broken.

*Oh Quinn.*

“What in Weisse’s name were you thinking?” I asked softly, as I knelt down to better examine his injuries.

“Well that’s the thing,” he gasped, “It was Weisse that I wanted to get a better look at.”

“And you though the best way to do that was to throw yourself off the roof?” Halea half shouted at him.

“What? No! I wasn’t trying to kill myself,” he said through gritted teeth, “The planet, I wanted to get a better look at the planet.”

“Just hold still,” I told him, “And you, stop aggravating him and help me heal this.”

Halea grumbled something about being able to look at the “stupid planet” from the balcony, but helped me get Quinn put back together regardless.

“Are you alright?” I asked, as he got unsteadily to his feet.

“Yeah,” he groaned, flexing the hand of his previously broken arm.

“Are you going to explain just what it was you were doing now?” Halea asked.

“Yeah, just give me a second, I need to get my-“ he started.

I heard metal scraping on stone, and then something fell from the roof, to land with the sound of screeching metal and broken glass on the lawn beside us.

“-telescope,” he finished with a sigh, “Well, Neferoy won’t be happy.”

“And what is that meant to be?” I asked wryly, nodding towards the heap of twisted metal.

“That’s the telescope,” he replied, “Give me a moment to clean this up, and then I can explain what I was doing.”

------

Quinn joined us back upstairs a short time later, and I shifted over on the couch to make room for him. He took a seat beside me, and with no preamble, began his explanation.

“I’ve been doing a bit of reading-“ he started.

“You? No way,” Brandy teased.

“Hush, I’m talking smart people words right now,” Quinn chastised, “The point is, I read some about Weisse, as in the planet, and wanted to know more about it. The astronomy books I managed to find seemed more bothered about how watching the planets might predict the future, than about actually describing reality, so I decided to do some observations of my own.”

“And you think your observations will be any better than what elven astronomers have done over the course of hundreds of years?” I asked sceptically, “I don’t mean to insult you Quinn, I know you’re fiercely intelligent, but what are you going to know that they don’t?”

“Heliocentrism? It wasn’t until the fourteen or fifteen hundreds that Copernicus figured it out on earth,” Quinn said, “Elven astronomers seem to assume that some mystical force is behind the movement of the planets, since they can’t make sense of the way that they move. Which makes sense, because no one’s invented calculus, and no one’s figured out that the planet revolves around the sun, and not the other way around.”

“Wait. What?”

“Exactly. Throw that piece of information in there, and suddenly the movement of any given planet makes much more sense,” he said, as if that was supposed to make sense.

“That doesn’t make *any* sense at all Quinn, what are you on about?” Halea demanded.

“Quinn,” I started gently, “Now I know that you’re eyes aren’t the best, however…”

“It’s not a matter of whether my eyes are awful or not,” he said, starting to sound a bit irritated, “It’s a matter of fact. Give me a minute, I’ve got something on my phone for this…”

I looked up at Brandy as Quinn dug through the pocket library, “Do you know what he’s talking about?”

“Yeah, like, obviously,” she said, “The Earth goes around the Sun, its totes true.”

“Totes?” I asked.

“Totally,” she explained, “Like, super totally.”

“Here we go,” Quinn said, cutting off my next question for Brandy, “Take a look at this.”

I leaned in close to look at the window into the small tablet, and Halea leaned over the back of the sofa to peer at the images as well.

“This is Earth’s solar system,” he explained, “In the middle is the Sun. Its basically a big giant nuclear explosion that’s been going on for billions of years, and these are all the planets. This one here is Earth,” he indicated with one long and slender finger.

“That’s tiny,” I challenged, “And Solaris is barely larger than the moon. Maybe this is how it is on Earth, though I’m sceptical of even that, but it can’t be how it is here.”

“I promise you it’s true,” he said, “I should even be able to prove it mathematically once I’ve made enough observations.”

“And supposedly you’ll be able to better predict where the planets will be once you have?” Halea asked.

He nodded, “Yeah, should be easy.”

“Easy?” I asked, “Really? How far into the future could you make these predictions?”

“Into eternity. It wouldn’t matter how far in the future the prediction was, I’ll be able to do a year, as easily as a thousand years. And!” he said, seeing my incredulous expression, “I’ll be able to teach you how to do it.”

“Really,” I said flatly.

“Really,” he nodded.

“How?” Halea asked, “Because I feel like whatever you do might revolutionize Astrology. I can barely conceive of what the world would look like if you were able to so easily predict the future of someone’s life.”

“Well that’s the thing,” he said, “I’m pretty sure that Astrology, as a form of divination, is crap. That, or the spell is getting its answers from some second source, not directly from astronomic observations. Or maybe this world is driven entirely by fate, in which case I probably want to leave as soon as possible.”

I felt a slight pang in my chest at these words, “Leave? You find Fate that distasteful?” I asked.

“Freedom Victorina,” he said, “If my life is entirely predetermined, then I’ve got none at all.”

Halea shook her head, “Fate and Luck are powerful forces Quinn, but no one of the two wholly rules us all.”

“Well that’s some consolation I suppose,” he allowed.

“Are you going to explain the method you use to make your predictions then?” I asked.

“Calculus? Sure,” he nodded, “The confusion with Weisse aside, I should be able to show you how the observations in any given Astrology book would be transformed from the strange sort of figure-eight, to an ellipse.”

It took some time, and I don’t think any of us had managed to fully grasp what Quinn was explaining, but he did at least demonstrate how the ‘formula’ was used to make sense of the observations he’d collected from various texts.

“This is amazing,” Ken said, “I thought algebra was interesting, but this is something else entirely. It’s almost an entirely different way of doing arithmetic.”

Brandy, who had been sitting quietly on her own and sipping her wine, perked up at this. It was an odd sort of expression she wore, something between disgust and confusion.

“And your phone can do this in an instant?” I asked, “I can see how calculus alone would be a powerful tool when used with magic, spell design would be so much easier, but with the phone…”

Brandy rose, confusion and disgust turning to irritation and outrage.

“Yeah, calculus is amazing!” Halea agreed excitedly.

“No!” Brandy interrupted loudly, “No! This is wrong, this is all wrong!”

She pointed at Quinn angrily, who was clearly very confused, “You can’t just- It’s not- Arghh! Calculus- Calculus is *not* cool! You don’t get to have super hot girls pay attention to you because you know calculus, it’s *wrong,* that’s not how it *works,*” she said, with a stamp of her foot.

Quinn was grinning like an idiot by the end of her tirade, and he stretched contentedly as he leaned back, one of his arms falling to drape across my shoulders.

“Problem?” he asked.

“Ohmygod. I just hate everything, and this is so not fair,” she grumbled, before sitting on the floor infront of the table where the bottle of wine sat, to pour herself another rather full glass, “This whole place is upside down.”

“What about Weisse then?” Ken asked, dismissing Brandy’s complaints, “How does your fancy formula work there?”

“Well that’s the thing,” Quinn mused, “I can’t make sense of it. I’ve already run through the figures on all the planets, it’s how I know that Tupilaq is a gas giant for example, but Weisse is the only one that doesn’t make any sense. I have no idea how I’m supposed to plot its orbit. And what about the stuff I’ve read about Weisse causing tsunamis and other apocalyptic nonsense, is that true?”

Halea shrugged, “I suppose the tides are a little stronger than usual when Weisse draws near, especially when it’s eclipsed by the moon, but usually the major concern that most people have is the coming winter. That’s only possible every other cycle though.”

“Uh, what?” Quinn asked, blinking rapidly, “You’re telling me it’s not all some apocalyptic prophecy nonsense?”

“No, of course not,” Halea said, confused, like I was, by Quinn’s lack of knowledge, “Weisse draws near every two and a half years, the seasons change, and Weisse draws away.”

“You seem very confused,” I observed.

“I am very confused,” Quinn exclaimed, “What do you mean the seasons change?”

“Isn’t it like this on Earth?” Halea asked, frowning.

“Nope,” Quinn said, “I think I would have noticed, this doesn’t even make sense.”

“You were perfectly willing to drop all this heliocentrism business in our laps, but this is where you draw the line?” I asked flatly.

“Well…“ he sighed, “Just explain it to me, what is ‘the seasons change’ supposed to mean?”

“Weisse draws near on a two and a half year cycle. One cycle is warm, and the other cold. We’re nearing the end of the cold cycle. Weisse’s approach will signal the shift into the warm cycle.”

“That,” he paused, “That’s very unique. Just how much warmer will it get?”

“Spring and Autumn will be as Summer,” I explained, “Winter will be as Autumn, and the Summer will be even warmer.”

“And then two and a half years later, it all switches back to normal?” he asked distractedly, as he was busy scribbling notes on a sheaf of paper he’d pulled from his belt.

“Normal?” Ken piped up, “You think that Winter is normal?”

This gave Quinn pause, “Huh, well I guess elves wouldn’t see it that way. A whole lot of stuff is starting to make a whole lot more sense, elves’ issues with the cold for one.”

“What of Earth?” I asked, “It lacks any such cycle?”

“Nope, it’s seasons are pretty much always like this,” he said, waving vaguely out the window, “Winter, Spring, Summer, and Autumn.”

“And you two have no problem with that?” Ken asked, looking between Quinn and Brandy, who was still sitting on the floor.

“I’m from California,” Brandy replied in a slightly slurred voice, as if that had been answer enough.

“And I’m Canadian,” Quinn answered, as if that was also some sort of explanation, “I still have no idea how this cycle would be possible though. If Weisse was on a highly eccentric orbit, it might account for some sort of regular disruption, but if it’s been doing that since the formation of the solar system, then this planet would have been flung off into space, or thrown into the sun billions of years ago.”

“You know Quinn,” Halea said, her tone amused, “It is possible that your Outsider knowledge isn’t the answer to every problem. Maybe this is something that only the gods can know.”

“Yeah Quinn!” Brandy piped up, a little more loudly than was strictly necessary, and a little more slurred than before, “Maybe your calculist doesn’t work hu-year”

“Hmm,” Quinn considered, before discarding it as a possibility, “Nah, I’ll figure it out.”

---------

The next incident wasn’t quite as injurious as the mishap with the roof, but it did demonstrate Quinn’s general disregard for self-preservation.

I was just passing the clubhouse’s small laboratory, after retrieving something from my rooms, when I heard a thump like a body hitting the floor, and the clattering of furniture being knocked over.

I leapt through the door to the small room, a Fireball springing into each hand. I expected to see Quinn standing over a vanquished enemy, and assassin or kidnapper that had snuck into the clubhouse to do harm to myself or the others, and I was ready for a fight if the adversary had not come alone.

I need not have worried.

I did not burst through to see Quinn standing over an opponent, Quinn wasn’t standing at all. He lay sprawled on the floor, glasses askew, with a lump already forming on his forehead. A small crystal lay near his outstretched hand, and next to the table lay the tall stool he’d knocked over in his fall.

*Really, again?*

 I felt gingerly at his face and neck, making sure that he wasn’t hurt too badly, before picking up the crystal. It was a Manastone, with a single point of mana, and very freshly made.

*Well, I suppose that explains this mess.*

I sat down beside Quinn, and pulled him up into my lap while I waited for him to regain his strength. I cast a quick healing spell to banish the livid red lump he’d acquired in the fall, and brushed a few strands of hair away from his face.

That was the one oddity about Quinn, *well okay, maybe not the ‘one’ oddity,* he wore his hair much differently than any elf. He refused to let it grow out, and instead he regularly cut it short like a dwarf or gnome might. The beard though, that was not in the style of gnomes or dwarves at all. I knew that humans grew facial hair, but unlike those other races that could, he never let it show. Even Andrew and the other male humans wore some sort of goatee or beard, but Quinn shaved every day. Aside from everything else about him, it was a unique look, not quite elven, not quite human.

Eventually his eyes fluttered open, interrupting the contemplation of his features.

“Hi,” he groaned.

“You said that last time,” I told him lightly.

“At least this time I didn’t break anything,” he replied.

“And what have you learned?” I asked, adopting a lecturing tone.

“That even if I technically have just enough enervation for something, that doesn’t mean I should try to do it,” he recited tiredly.

“You know, you could have asked for help,” I told him softly, “You didn’t need to do it on your own.”

“Yeah,” he said quietly, “Still getting used to that I think. Thank you by the way.”

“Thank you?” I asked, raising an eyebrow.

“For all this,” he said, spreading his hands to either side, “If you hadn’t picked me up, I still would have found a club, but it wouldn’t have been like this. I’ve got friends now, because you gave me a chance. I’ve got more friends now than I ever had back on Earth. The help that all of you have given me, and the willingness you’ve got to listen to my inane ramblings… Well, I owe you a lot Victorina. Whatever happens between us, wherever this goes, I’m not ever going to forget that. Thank you.”

I looked down at him, laying there with his head resting in my lap. At the time I had considered it a favour to him, but only a minor one, I had after all gained nearly as much out of the deal as he had. But judging from his tone, and the intense look in his small green eyes, he didn’t see it that way. All this time it had meant something special to him, and I hadn’t even realized it.

“You’re welcome,” I replied simply.

“Well,” he said, closing his eyes, “I think I’ll just rest here for a bit, I’ve got an awfully comfy pillow. After all, you seem to object to me hurting myself,” he finished with a smile.

“Oh, you’re tired are you?” I asked in an amused tone.

“Exhausted,” he replied, “Using up all your enervation in one go really takes it out of a Mage.”

“So you’d like it if I gave you the chance to rest?” I asked innocently.

He opened one eye, and looked up at my wolfish smile, “So that’s where this is going?” he asked.

“Mmm hmm,” I nodded, slipping out from underneath him, and gently lowering his head to the stone floor, “Now you don’t go anywhere,” I told him, as I rose to my feet.

I went to the door, and poked my head out into the hallway for a quick check around. *The others should still be in class for a little while more.* Then I shut the door, and turned back to Quinn.

“Right here then?” he asked wryly.

“Yes,” I whispered hoarsely, as I unclasped my robes, and shrugged out of them.

They fell to the floor, and what little else I'd been wearing followed shortly afterwards.

Up till now I’d usually let Quinn do as he pleased when we were alone, and together. Sometimes it took a little prompting, or a little taunting, to get him to be as rough with me as I liked, but eventually he always let me have it. It was the one moment of weakness I allowed myself. It had been one of the first days we were properly ‘together’, when I got the wakeup call I’d needed. We’d both been wrapped up in the infatuation of a new relationship, and I hadn’t been thinking. We’d been sitting in the library, and I’d been watching him work, when Thera and Brandy interrupted us. What must they have thought? I’d been curled up in his hoodie, in his *clothes*, and practically wrapped around him. In the moments before they’d arrived, it had been bliss, cuddling with Quinn. Once they saw me though, I realized that it had been a mistake. Not the relationship with Quinn, certainly not, but they’d seen me, more vulnerable then than I’d ever been before. I couldn’t have that, and that had been the last time I’d been foolish enough to put myself in a position where I might be seen to be drawing on Quinn for strength or comfort. No more cuddling on the couch, and I was certainly not going to be seen wearing his clothes any more. If we showed any mutual affection when the others were present, it was a mutual display of strength. I certainly did not advertise my weaknesses.

But in bed? Well, then we couldn’t be observed could we? That was when I let it all out, and gods, it was satisfying. It was a dark and hungry sort of satisfaction, but it just felt so *good*. And even then, no matter what I goaded Quinn into doing to me, I knew that I was ultimately still in control, still safe.

Thera though had been a firm advocate, when she and I had found time for some girl talk, of the benefits of being on top, and now seemed like a perfect chance to explore her suggestions.

I pounced on Quinn, and tore at his clothes until his was naked on the cold stone floor below me.

“A little thirsty are we?” he taunted.

“Hush,” I rasped, before lifting myself up, and pressing myself back down onto him.

I arched my back as a shiver ran down my spine, and I felt his hands find my waist, though I could tell that he was still exhausted, there was barely any strength in those long fingers. I took things slowly at first, taking the time to savour the experience, and already I could tell that Thera had been right.

*Oh Verrin, is this what men get to feel? Suddenly I understand why men are such dogs, and why Halea is such a harlot.*

I leaned down to rested my elbows on his chest, and knotted my fingers in his hair, though he was big enough that I almost couldn’t reach. I planted a kiss in the middle of his chest, inhaling the smell of his body and licking at the sweat that was starting to bead on his chest. I found myself letting out small moans as I rocked back and forth on his hips and sucked at his chest.

“Like I said,” he said through a contented groan, “Thirsty.”

I would have drawn him into a kiss to silence his teasing, but with the difference in size, that wasn’t going to happen without some serious contortions. Instead I tried a different tack to silence him, and pressed myself the rest of the way down, grinding my hips against his. He let out a gasp, and a groan, and while that was a great deal quieter than I was being, I considered it an accomplishment. Quinn was a very quiet lover, and I’d found early on that any sort of vocalization meant that I was doing something *very* right.

And then someone opened the sarding front sarding door, and I froze.

“We’re back!” I heard Brandy call from the entryway.

Quinn, the bastard, did not freeze at the sound of potential visitors, and instead started rocking his hips underneath me.

“Quinn? Victorina?” she called, “We brought food home.”

“Quinn’s probably stomping around on the roof again,” Halea said, while Quinn continued to get me closer to what would be a rather noisy conclusion.

“Ww-hh-at if they c-come in h-here?” I hissed, as I tried my best to keep myself from letting out a whimpering moan, “And this r-room is not s-sound proof.”

“Come in here?” he asked, “Well I guess we better finish before that happens, unless you’re satisfied already.”

“That doesn’t seem terribly safe, someone really ought to talk to him,” came the sound of Ken’s voice.

“No,” I said, thumping one hand onto his chest, and clamping the other over my mouth to muffle the ensuing groan of pleasure.

I set my hands on Quinn’s chest, lifting myself up and letting myself down as quietly as possible. It was torture, trying to go quickly enough to reach a speedy conclusion, without going so fast that I started making embarrassing noises that might be overheard by our clubmates who were still bare yards away.

Quinn of course, seemed to be taking a sick sort of satisfaction in the whole situation. I was initially confused though, as he reached one exploratory hand between us. I was much less confused, once I realized what he was looking for, and he started teasing gently at it. I clamped one hand back over my mouth, and I felt my eyes start to water as I pounded on fist on Quinn’s chest repeatedly.

*Oh gods, they’re going to hear me.*

“What?” he whispered, as he continued the delicate finger work, “Is that not enough? You want more? Well, if you insist.”

I stopped pounding on Quinn’s chest, needing both hands to contain the sounds that I was making. My eyes were streaming with tears, and I kicked my feet against the ground as my back arched.

“You know Victorina,” Quinn said, though his voice was growing awfully husky, “You should get ready to cast Teleport, I’m pretty sure they’re going to hear you.”

I pulled my hands away from my mouth to snap out a retort, and it was precisely then that Quinn slipped a rather girthy manipulator into a very novel place. It was more than enough to make me lose control, and the beginning of a moan escaped my lips before I managed to clamp down on any further noise.

“Hey,” I heard Halea say, “I think one of them is working in the lab. Probably Quinn, you know what he’s like when he’s in the middle of something. He gets so deep into it that he barely notices anything that goes on around him. Minki, why don’t you go pull him out of whatever he’s pounding away at, the man needs to eat sometime.”

*Oh gods no.*

“Okay,” came Minki’s voice, quiet already, and muffled further by the hopefully thick enough door.

“Cast it,” Quinn said calmly, as I came down from the peak, still quivering uncontrollably, “Unless you want Minki to see this.”

“I am g-going to k-kill you Quinn,” I stammered out, as I fumbled through the gestures to the spell.

I had to retry them a second, and then a third time, before I finally managed to finish, and we were finally whisked away.

We landed in a heap on my bedroom floor, and I let myself drop bonelessly across his chest, as I tried my best to keep my lunch down.

“Well, that was close,” he said, “And, bonus, you didn’t throw up this time.”

“You are an awful and cruel man,” I said, as I rolled off of him, and lay to his side, “That could have gone terribly. What if they’d seen us there, in the- the middle of *that?*”

“Well, considering your robes and underwear are still strewn across the lab, they’ve probably figured it out already,” he said, and my blood ran cold.

“No!” I moaned, “Oh gods no!”

“Ah, I’m just fucking with you,” he said lightly, “I grabbed all of our stuff with my manipulators. That was actually right before I had the idea to see if the manipulator would fit in-"

I rolled over, and started drumming my fists on his chest until he finally shut up.

-----

It wasn’t until the third, *and the fourth,* incidents, that Quinn actually tried to burn down and knock over the clubhouse. Now those were a particularly interesting couple of days.


# Chapter 56

**Victorina**

-----

It was only after the third incident, that I really started to worry. I was aware that there were some differences between humans and elves, but it was only after my experiences with Quinn that I started to worry that humans might be a little more… relaxed, about self-preservation than elves. Leaping from the roof of a three story building had seemed at the time like the most that any one man could do to himself, but then Quinn was always full of surprises.

I was just casting my umbrella spell as I was getting ready to leave, when Halea leaned out from the balcony over the entranceway, “Hey Vic, where are you off too?” she called.

“The Library, why?” I responded.

I’d been planning to look into the politics of the former Ariros guild lands, I needed to know who our future vassals might be after all, and wasn’t really sure that I wanted anyone else along for such a trip. I trusted my clubmates as much as I trusted anyone, but I still hadn’t told any of them what Quinn had planned. Aside from it just being good practice, I didn’t want to get anyone’s hopes up.

She leaned back and glanced down the hall, before hurrying quietly to the stairs, and down the steps.

“I was thinking that we should take a look at what maps and charts there are of the land north of the city,” she said quietly.

*Dammit Quinn, have you told _everyone_ what you’re planning?*

“Why exactly?” I asked, dreading the answer.

“Well Quinn can help enchant manastones now, I figured that we ought to get some proper base stones to enchant,” she said, still keeping her voice low.

*Crisis averted, if briefly. However…*

“Then why do you want to go poking around in the Library for maps?” I asked with furrowed brows, “If you want to pick up the stones then get Ken to write you a letter of credit from the club and take it down to a jeweller. And why are you whispering?”

“The jeweller is too expensive,” she said dismissively, “Any gemstone good enough to make a properly large manastone is going to be really expensive. So that leaves two options, and one of them is going to be way more fun than the other.”

“Oh? And I’m guessing that your *fun* alternative is something that Ken would object strenuously too?”

“Exactly,” she whispered back, “We could try to find someone that’s still got some high quality crystals that would work, *or…*”

“We do something horrifically dangerous to steal some?” I asked wryly, “If you’re so worried about cost, just wait until you can buy the crystals like everyone else does.”

“Hey, find, not steal. It’s not stealing if no one owns it,” she insisted, “And I don’t want to wait around like everyone else does, exactly because it is what everyone else does. Good crystals cost nearly as much as the gemstones do, and they all get snatched up within hours of being brought into the city.”

“Alright, fine,” I acquiesced, “What’s the alternative?”

“Well Quinn had been badgering me about the cursed guildhall, you know how curious he can get,” she explained, *yes, yes I do,* “And between that and your story about Quinn’s first attempt at manastone, I was reminded of something that I’d come across in passing, oh, it must have been a year ago.”

“I’m listening,” I prompted.

“Well supposedly, and this was before everything went tits up at the guild, the Ariros Mages were starting to look into what resources might be found under those mountains. Well one of the things they found was…” she prompted.

“Crystal?” I guessed.

“Crystal,” she nodded, “A lot of it, a whole lot of it.”

“Halea…” I said gently, “That was-“

“A thousand years ago,” she agreed, “I know, but I think it can still work. I know that pretty much any idiot thrill seeker will have picked the guildhall itself clean, but I think the mine should be fine. Its days and days north of here, in the foothills of the mountains, and probably not many other people know of it any more. And everyone’s heard all about how everything north of the city is a monster infested deathtrap. Almost no one that knows of or knew of the mine is going to go take that risk, not when they’d be traipsing about the foothills looking for something that they’re not even sure is there. And no one that didn’t already know is going to bother going that far just to look for some loot.”

“The more you tell me about this idea, the worse it sounds,” I told her.

“Well, it’s only a terrible idea if we don’t know where the mine is,” she said confidently, “And I know exactly where it is.”

“Really?” I asked, quite surprised.

“Sort of?” she hedged, “I managed to find someone else’s notes, I don’t know whose, but they detail the Mage’s exploration of the Library. One of the things that he came across was some of the old, old records for each of the guilds.”

“So you know where to find records that may or may not exist, that may or may not include maps and charts, that may or may not show where the mine is.”

“Yes.”

“And this is all also assuming that the mine hasn’t since caved in, flooded, or that it was even dug in the first place.”

“Yes.”

I sighed, “Fine, come on.”

-----

It was some sort of miracle, but we found those damn maps. They were exactly where Halea’s little notebook had said they would be.

“Well, what now?” Halea asked, as we looked down at the thick vellum map that when rolled out, covered the entirety of the massive table before us.

“Why are you asking me? You were the one who insisted we come looking for this.”

“Why am I asking you? You’re the leader of the club!” she insisted, and in fairness, she was right, “So what’s the plan?”

“Do you really want to rush off north on thousand year old information?” I asked sceptically.

“It does sound rather foolish when you put it that way, but who else would have been there to loot the place? And even if it has caved in or flooded a bit, I bet that wouldn’t be too much of a problem,” she said earnestly.

“I suppose,” I allowed, “With some earth moving spells, and some way of dealing with any flooding… That does still leave the issue of whatever creatures inhabit the forest though.”

“So we bring along Neferoy and Quinn. Neferoy’ll jump at the chance for cheap manastones, and I don’t think anyone needs to tell *you* how good Quinn is in a fight. We don’t even need to walk or ride most of the way. It’s not like the whole of the guild’s lands are deserted, there’s still some villages near the borders with the neighbouring guilds.”

“So we’d just teleport as far north as we could manage, and then cut in east to head for the mine?” I asked, nodding towards the mark on the map.

“Exactly, we’d get more than half way there before we even needed to worry about what we might run into in the forest.”

“Well then,” I said, “Let’s go back and ask Quinn. We’ll also want him to take an image of this map with his little Outsider contraption as well, I’d rather not need to take the time to copy all this.”

*And I imagine he’ll be interested in what else there is here.*

------

One of the windows to the clubhouse was broken when we returned, and thick white smoke was billowing out of it.

“Is that the lab?” Halea asked.

“Yes,” I said through gritted teeth.

“Huh, I wonder what Quinn’s been up to?”

“You seem very relaxed about the clubhouse being on fire,” I said, as I quickened my pace.

“Oh, it just looks like a small fire, I’m sure Quinn’s fine.”

“We’ll see what I can do about that.”

----

I stepped out of the entryway, around the corner into the hall, to see Quinn sitting in the middle of the hall in front of the door. He looked exhausted, his face was covered in soot, and I was sure that he’d had two eyebrows last time I’d seen him.

“Quinn!” I growled, pointing an angry finger at him.

“Oh, hey Victorina,” he said, turning and giving me a big stupid grin, the stark whiteness of his teeth contrasting strongly with his soot blackened face, “Don’t worry, the fire’s out, and I’m fine. Just waiting for the smoke to clear.”

“What in the name of all that is sacred were you doing?” I demanded, “And how did whatever you were doing break and window and light the lab on fire?”

“Oh, I was experimenting with different black powder mixes. I’m pretty sure I managed to figure out the best mix too,” he explained, seemingly oblivious of my displeasure, “As for the window and the fire, well maybe I didn’t think things through all the way.”

“You?” Halea said, “Nooo, I can’t believe that.”

“Quiet you,” he said, waving dismissively, “There was some probably some particulate matter left in the air, and I forgot that not all of the clubhouse’s lights are magical. It must have caught on one of the candles on the wall by the door. Well that set of the powder on the bench in front of me, and that blew out the window and lit some stuff on fire. Nothing important though,” he added hurriedly, “And I’ll pay for the window.”

I turned to Halea, “Do we still…”

“Yes,” Halea insisted, “See, if this proves anything, it’s that Quinn is courageous enough that he’s willing to take risks when he thinks it’s necessary.”

“Courageous?” I asked, “I don’t think that’s the word that first comes to mind.”

“What are we talking about here?” Quinn asked, from his place on the floor.

I sighed, “Go ahead and tell him.”

------

Quinn had loved the idea of course, and promised to have something useful to show of his experimentation with black powder for the trip. I was a little hesitant to encourage his fascination with pyrotechnics, but I didn’t think that he was about to stop what he was doing any time soon. Instead I banished Quinn’s future experiments with pyrotechnics to the back garden, and gathered the rest of our adventuring party in the library to plan our trip.

Thera came by just a little later, poking her head in to say hello, though I saw that she was carrying a rather sizeable package along with her.

“Hey, has anyone seen Quinn?” I’ve got the stuff he wanted me to make,” she said, hefting the package.

“He’s out back,” I replied absently, and had intended to get back to working with the others, when I had a terrible thought.

*Oh dear Weisse, is that package full of more of that black powder?*

“Hold on!” I called, just before she closed the door.

She pushed it back open a bit, “Yes?” she asked expectantly.

“Just what is it you’ve made for him?

“This?” she asked, adjusting her grip, “It’s something Quinn called mercury fulminate. He said it was really important, and that I had to make absolutely sure that no one else heard of it, and especially that they didn’t find out how it was made.”

“Not black powder then?”

She shook her head, “What’s that?”

“Quinn’s new way of destroying the clubhouse,” I said wryly, “He can explain it better, he’s out back working on the stuff.”

“Well,” she said with a smile as she shut the door, “Maybe he needs a hand.”

“Oh don’t worry,” Neferoy said, having noticed my expression as Thera left, “Quinn’s clever enough to avoid any *big* mistakes, and the most he’ll end up doing out in the garden is scorching a few trees.”

“Yeah Victorina,” Halea said with a grin, “What’s the worst that could happen?”

-----


# Chapter 57

**Quinn**

-----

The back yard of the clubhouse wasn’t terribly huge, but being in the middle of the city meant that space was at a premium, and so I guessed that something like this would still be considered quite the luxury. With a short stone wall ringing the yard, and the large pine trees planted along the wall, the yard was rather well screened from the sights and sounds of the city beyond. Which suited me just fine, I didn’t want any prying eyes to see just what it was I was doing.

What was I doing? Well I was revolutionizing warfare in Elardia, that’s what I was doing. There was really only one piece missing, and that was…

“Hey Quinn,” Thera called, as if on cue, ”I’ve got your stuff for you.”

I turned away from my work, to see her shouldering her way through the clubhouse’s back door, carrying a rather bulky package in both hands.

“Thanks, and it even looks like you’ve still got all of your fingers, I’m impressed.”

“Were you expecting me to lose some fingers along the way?” she asked, raising an eyebrow.

“Wasn’t sure, mostly it was going to come down to how closely you followed my instructions,” I replied.

“Well you’ll be glad to know that I followed them to the letter, your demonstration of just what this stuff could do was pretty eye opening,” she said, as she set down the package on the table and took a seat, “Is this what wars are fought with on Earth?”

“This specifically? Well not exactly. There’s more advanced primers in use now, and even back when this stuff was used, it wasn’t the main focus. No, that was black powder.”

“Right, isn’t that what you used to blow up the lab?” she asked sweetly.

“That,” I said, raising one finger sternly, “Was an accident.”

“If you say so,” she teased, “What are these things?” she asked, pointing to the future of warfare on Elardia.

“That’s the future of warfare on Elardia,” I replied.

She sighed, and gave me an irritated look.

“They’re rifles,” I explained, “This one here on the left is a matchlock, maybe you’ve heard about the weapons my Uncle is making for Nezzabi?” I asked, and she nodded, “Well that’s what this is. Same design, except better made, since I can cast Reshape, and have a few specialized tools enchanted with the spell. That’s how I did the rifling for example.”

“Rifling?”

“See here?” I asked, casting Light to shine down the barrel, “Grooves cut into the metal of the barrel, it makes the projectile spin. It doesn’t work the same as fletching on an arrow, but it serves the same purpose.”

“So your Uncles weapons are the… rifle? Equivalent of a bow that shoots arrows without any fletching?”

“Exactly,” I smiled, “Which means already my weapons are better than his.”

She rolled her eyes, “Continue, what about the other ones?”

“This one is a wheel lock, and this one is a flint lock. They both work on more or less the same principle,” I explained, “Which is that instead of having a bit of slow match burning to carry the flame, they use a piece of flint striking against a bit of metal.”

“They don’t look much different than the match lock,” she noted.

“And they’re not, really the only difference is the lock system. They all use loose powder, take ages to reload, and aside from the wheel lock won’t always fire reliably,” I explained, “And even then, the wheel lock is the most delicate of the three, and the most complicated to make. If I hadn’t had a lighter to pull apart, it would have taken much longer to make this, even without Reshape.”

“How is the mercury fulminate supposed to work with these ones then?” she asked.

“Well that’s the thing, it doesn’t. It’s only once you get to the next stage in firearms development that it has a use,” I said, picking up another one of my rifles, “This is where it starts to matter. You’ll notice that there’s no flint on the end of this rifle’s hammer.”

“I’m guessing that the hammer is supposed to whack a bit of the fulminate, and that sets off the powder?”

“You’ve got it,” I nodded, “But the thing is, once you’ve got the tech for mercury fulminate and cap and ball revolvers, you’re pretty much all the way to fixed ammo.”

“Fixed ammo?”

“Like this,” I explained, picking up one of the few brass cartridges I’d been able to make, “It’s a little more complex than just using loose powder, but it’s much much faster. Even with this rifle here,” I said, indicating the cap and ball rifle, “You’re pretty much assembling your ammo from scratch, every time you need to fire the gun. With this though,” I waggled the brass cartridge, “It’s all one piece. The fulminate is here at the back, the brass is full of powder, and the projectile goes at the end.”

“And just how powerful would this be then?” she asked, “Is it any better than a bow?”

“That is a very good question,” I said, setting the weapon aside, “Even with the cap and ball rifle, that’s the one there by the way, you could make the argument that a bow is better. It’s faster, you don’t need to worry about the powder getting wet, and it’s just generally far less complicated. Especially since if it came down to it, a soldier could make their own arrows, but not their own powder. But once you start talking about fixed ammo, the bow is unquestionably inferior.”

“Why though,” she challenged, “Even with the ‘fixed ammo’ as you call it, how is that going to be any faster than a bow? You’ve still got to put the bullet in each time you want to fire, and it still has all those other troubles that you just mentioned.”

“If I was going to settle for single shot rifles, maybe,” I allowed, “And it would be a *big* maybe. One thing to consider is how difficult it is to train someone on a bow, compared to what it takes for a gun. A bow takes years of training to be able to do properly. A gun though, you can train someone sufficiently on a gun in a couple of weeks if you’re really strapped for time. It’s not ideal, especially since elves live longer and aren’t quite as plentiful as humans, but being able to turn every able bodied person into an effective soldier on a couple weeks’ notice is pretty useful.”

“I think that the lords and nobles try to do that anyway,” she said, “Even if it just ends with a lot of people dying most of the time.”

“Well, I doubt that any of these weapons is going to cut down on the number of people dying,” I grimaced, “But it's certainly going to make a big difference in just who’s dying. Especially when you consider this last rifle on the table.”

I hefted the rifle, and drew back the bolt.

“I might have skipped a few designs in between cap and ball, and bolt action rifles, but once I got the proper Reshape tooling, this wasn’t very hard at all to build.”

“Why is this so special?” she asked, peering into the action of the gun.

I pulled the tab on the back of the magazine, and pulled it free, “See this?”

She looked confused, but nodded.

“It holds ten cartridges, takes three or four seconds to switch out, and as long as the magazine has got more rounds in it, you can fire the rifle as fast as you can work the action,” I explained.

“Oh,” she said, “*Oh.* That… Well I imagine that changes things quite a bit.”

“Just a little,” I agreed, “I still need to test them, since I haven’t had any fulminate of my own to work with, but I suppose that issue’s dealt with now.”

“Is this going to be enough to test with?” Thera asked, “I didn’t make very much.”

“Well let’s get this unwrapped and take a look, but you’d be surprised at how little I’ll need.”

The package was mostly a big bundle of cotton padding, with some small pouches of the powdered fulminate spread throughout. It wasn’t a lot, maybe a hundred grams in total, but that was plenty for my needs.

“Yeah Thera, this is perfect. I’ve got enough here for fifty or a hundred rounds of ammunition.”

“Are you going to be doing that much testing?” Thera asked, “That seems like a lot.”

I shrugged, “Maybe. I’ll want to proof all of these guns, and figure out the point of aim for the bolt action rifle, which might mean I go through all of the fulminate you’ve made.”

“Well now that I’ve got it all figured out, it wouldn’t be too hard for me to make more, Quinn. What are you going to do with all this once you’ve tested it though?” she asked, “Are you planning on sharing what you’ve made?”

*Hell no.*

“I’ve got some plans, but I’m not going to go looking for a patron just yet. Besides, all of these are made with brass receivers and brass barrels. I’d like to be using steel barrels, and I’ve still got some more improvements to make, so they’re not quite as ready as I’d like them to be yet.”

“Steel?” Thera asked, eyebrow raised.

“Like iron, except better,” I explained, “Of course, it’s more complicated than that, but it gives the general idea.”

“Well what about these brass guns then?” she asked, looking back to the table, “Are they any good?”

“More or less, I mean even the matchlock is better than anything my Uncle’s made, but it’s all a bit heavier than I’d like. And it’s not going to be strong enough to stand up to smokeless powder, whenever I get that made. Right now though, each individual shot will be a little weaker than a low powered Magic Missle, which isn’t too bad for something that requires no enchantment at all.”

“Smokeless powder? You can make it burn without any smoke?”

“Not quite, just a lot less smoke. It’s actually something I wanted to ask you about, since I’m going to need a couple different acids to make it work. If I’ve got those acids though, I won’t need you to procure smelly sulphur and saltpetre for me.”

“Just flesh melting acid.”

“Exactly,” I said cheerily.

“Can’t you just cast Acid Jet or whatever else you Mages use to maim each other?” she asked, "Then you wouldn’t need to bother purchasing it at all."

“I’d thought that would work, and that was actually the first thing I tried. The trouble is that the acid disappears after a minute or so, and if I was just trying to melt something, then that wouldn’t be any problem at all. The trouble is, the acid reacts with the other reagents, forming a compound of the different ingredients. So when the acid dissipates a minute or so later, most of the rest of the compound goes along with it.”

“Well then, if I get you the acid you’ll be able to make this…”

“White powder,” I supplied.

“White powder then,” she nodded, “Why didn’t you start with this stuff anyway, instead of messing around with the black powder? I’m going to have a much easier time getting the acid, than the other materials, especially since you’re adamant that I be all secretive about it. No one’s going to bat an eye if I go procuring batches of acid for a Mage’s club, not like they would have if they found out about the other materials.”

“My phone wasn’t working at first, and I hadn’t had time to dig through all my old text books. I had some vague idea of how guncotton is made, but it’s terribly unstable. One of my Military History textbooks though went over the transition period between black and smokeless powders, and actually includes the formula for the early French efforts in the area.”

“Whatever,” she shrugged, “Am I going to borrow one of your belt pouches again, or can I just order this normally and have them drop it off at the clubhouse?”

“Actually,” I said, reaching into one of my entirely mundane pockets, “I’ve got a present for you.”

“It’s a purse,” she noted.

“A *magic* purse,” I insisted, “See here, it’s got the same enchantment as my belt.”

“Quinn that’s…” she started, “This must have been *really* expensive. Um, isn’t…”

“Isn’t what?” I asked.

“Isn’t Victorina going to be a little miffed that you’re showering some other woman in gifts?”

“It’s not a shower,” I said defensively, “It’s one gift. And besides, it’s barely even a gift. Think of it more as a bribe.”

“A bribe?” she asked wryly.

“Exactly, a bribe. Can’t have you going off and telling everyone about my secret plans.”

“Secret plans? Am I going to have an important place in your new administration?”

“I dunno, I’ll have to ask Victorina how she feels about me taking concubines.”

“Concubines?” she laughed, “You do have big plans for the future.”

“Very big,” I nodded, and she rolled her eyes.

“Just how are things between the two of you then?”

“Pretty good?”

“You say that like you’re not sure,” she observed.

“I just don’t really have a good point of comparison,” I said honestly, “This has lasted longer than any other relationship I’ve been in.”

“Hold on a minute,” she said, turning her head to one side, “What about that week with me in Myra?”

“What about it?” I asked, trying to keep my face from flushing.

“Oh my gods,” she said, eyes widening, “Was that the first time you were ever with a w-“

“Alright! Enough already,” I interrupted, “No it wasn’t the first time.”

“Are you sure?” she asked with a grin, “You’re turning pretty pink.”

“It might have been the first time that lasted more than a minute,” I grumbled quietly.

“Oh Quinn,” she howled, “You are just so precious!”

“Go away,” I said petulantly, “Or you’ll not get any more bribes from me.”

“You know,” she said, putting a finger to her lips, “This explains so much about you.”

“I hate you so much right now.”

Thera’s comments, even if they were rather embarrassing, did give me something to think about once she’d finally left. It had been just about a month since the incident after the ball, and I hadn’t been exaggerating when I’d told Thera that was the longest any relationship had lasted. As far as I could tell though, it was going pretty well. There were some hiccups of course, and the cultural differences between elves and humans had started to show themselves a little, but the two of us were happy with each other’s company. There had been a minor shift, after those first couple days, when she’d given me back my hoodie. Up till then she’d barely taken the thing off, even sleeping in it once or twice. Somehow, despite Victorina being a literal princess, it had given her a sort of girl next door quality. With her silver hair all bunched up in the hood, and the huge blue-grey eyes, she’d looked… Not normal exactly, the eyes threw that off, but she seemed softer and less lethal.

That wasn’t to say that I wanted someone who was small and vulnerable or that I was looking for someone to protect, but as it was now, I did find myself feeling like I needed to be ‘on’ all the time. It wasn’t quite as extreme as when we’d gone to the ball, or when I was in class, but I found that I couldn’t relax quite as much around lethal Victorina as I could with hoodie Victorina. Now that was not to say that I was about to jump ship, because good god damn, Victorina is amazing both in body and mind. I did miss the softer and more approachable Victorina of the first couple days, but having a girlfriend that was also a total badass had benefits of its own.

*Who knows? Maybe this is exactly what I need to get over some of my awkwardness.*

-----

I managed to get a set of runic symbols made that same afternoon, a little after my talk with Thera. In anticipation of Thera delivering the mercury fulminate, I’d been experimenting with the magical creation of steel for use in the construction of my new guns. It was harder than I initially thought it would be, since it was a bit more complex than just adding more heat. I managed to figure it out eventually though, and the process consisted mainly of forming a furnace with Apportation to contain the heat and only then casting the Heat spell itself. I didn’t get a whole lot of steel, and it wasn’t a very high grade of steel since I hadn’t added oxygen and carbon quite properly, but it had been enough for me to create several small tablets to inscribe the runic symbols.

The book I was teaching myself from had explained how to go about creating your own set of symbols, and had said that while you could have someone else make a set for you, it was almost always better to do it yourself. It was entirely possible to have a master goldsmith create a set from precious metals, and that would grant some benefit to the symbol caster, but even then it was only a marginal increase in effectiveness over an amateur crafting the symbols for themselves.

It was that night, sitting on the edge of the bed, that I tried symbol divination for the first time.

*So, just how is it going to work out between Victorina and I then?*

I cast the spell, my question firmly in mind, and reached into the pouch where I kept my symbols.

---
**ᛋᛠᚠ**
---

*Hmm.*

“What’s this then?” Victorina asked, rolling over to lay on her belly next to me, sideways across the bed.

“I’ve wanted to experiment with divination for a while now. I want to see if I can get a good idea of just how accurate it really is,” I explained, “No idea what this is supposed to mean though.”

“Does it say ‘put away your toys, and sard the beautiful woman lying next to you?’” she asked.

“No actually.”

“Well it’s what I’m saying,” she said, as she rolled over and stretched languidly.

“Well if I must,” I sighed.

**Quinn**

----

My dreams that night were *quite* interesting, and featured not one, but four Victorina’s. Each of which seemed particularly interested in maximizing my personal enjoyment, and I was slightly disappointed when I woke up and there was just the one gorgeous and naked woman in bed with me.

And there was another thing that gave me hope for the future, or at least for a future that included Victorina and I together. I found that I slept better when she was around. I’d only had two bad dreams when she was present, one of which she’d even personally interceded in.

*That’s something I’ll need to explore, I wonder what else you could do with dream magic. Could I use it to study while asleep? Now there’s an idea…*

The rest of the time it was much like what I’d just experienced. I didn’t always remember my dreams, but they were always pleasant and those I did remember tended to feature Victorina in some capacity, even when my dreams weren’t specifically sexual in nature. Sometimes it was something absolutely mundane, like the two of us taking a walk, going to the store, or eating together.

*Could be my subconscious is trying to tell me something. Maybe I should try to pick up some oneiromancy next time I’ve got the chance.*

It was only on those occasions that we slept separately, that I found it hard to sleep through the night. I found myself waking up after having strange and disjointed dreams, usually involving water, and missing the solid warmth of Victorina’s body curled up against me.

“Sleep well?” Victorina asked through a yawn, as she pulled herself up to rest her chin on my chest.

“Yeah,” I replied sleepily, “Any plans for this morning?” I asked, as I let one hand drift down her side.

“Unfortunately, I’ve got quite a bit of club business to take care of today,” she said, as she brushed my hand away, just as it was getting to the interesting bits, “But if you can wash up and get dressed quickly we can go to breakfast together before I’ve got to rush off.”

“I suppose that will have to do for now,” I said reluctantly.

“Be quick about it then,” she replied, before casting a spell and teleporting herself across the hall to her own room.

It didn’t take long at all to shave, wash, and dress, and I found myself waiting for several minutes for Victorina to get herself ready. It was raining again, which seemed to be the norm for Nimre in the Autumn, not that I minded. I liked the sound the rain made on the shingles of the clay roof, and on the glass of the windows. I liked the musty earthy smell of rain, but most of all, I appreciated how the rain would bring with it a wave of cool air. I’d take a massive thunderstorm that ripped branches loose with only the force of the wind, or that blasted trees to charred splinters, if it just meant that it wasn’t going to be hot today.

*Man, this eternal summer stuff is going to suck. Could Weisse do me a favour and just stay the hell away?*

“Ready to go Quinn?” Victorina called, as she stepped into the front hall.

“Yeah, can you do that umbrella thing? It’s pouring rain out there.”

She nodded, as she ran through the hand gestures for her spell,

“Anywhere in particular you’d like to go?” she asked.

I shook my head, “Anywhere is fine, I figured you’d want to find somewhere close to your errand for this morning.”

“That’s probably for the best, come on, I know a nice place.”

I followed her out the door, and into the din of the crashing rain, doing my best to stay close to her to shelter under the field she’d created to keep off the rain.

“Quinn,” she started, once we’d walked for a bit, “Do you think you can get some camping supplies together in time for Louday? I was thinking that if the weather is going to keep this up,” she said, waving vaguely at the sky, “I’d rather go earlier into the autumn, rather than later. Besides, I imagine you might find the manastones useful for whatever it is you’re planning to do?”

“Louday? Yeah, do we want to leave right at the start of next week though? I can probably get away with it, I’m ahead in my classes, but what about the rest of you?”

“I can manage, and Neferoy and Halea assure me they’ll be fine. We’d end up cutting into a couple days of classes anyways, and I’d rather arrange it so that we return when we’ve got a day off so we’ve got a chance to rest before going back to classes. You might have finagled things so that you’ve got three days off each week, but the rest of us only get the one.”

I shrugged, “Works for me, anything in particular we’ll need?”

“Um, well just use your judgement I suppose.”

I raised an eyebrow and looked down at her, “Use my judgement?”

“I’m a sarding princess, how often do you think I go camping? You’re the expert, make Ken write you a letter of credit, and go get whatever we’ll need.”

“As you wish,” I said wryly.

“Now that’s better,” she said haughtily, “Now here’s the place, do your best to look respectable and not like a giant, wilds dwelling, barbarian.”

----

I didn’t actually need to do a whole lot of shopping to get ready for the camping trip, since I already had enough camping supplies tucked away in my Portable Hole for two people, and enough food for several times that. So my shopping trip mainly consisted of restocking what food I’d already gone through, and purchasing the raw materials I’d need to make several more hammocks. I was originally only going to bother making another two, but if I was going to buy the materials and get all my tools out, it wouldn’t be that much more work to make a bunch more. So I made eleven, which on top of the two I already had, meant that I had one for each member of the club, plus a spare. It was probably overkill, especially since I also now had thirteen thick blankets tucked away in there, but it would mean that if worst came to worst, we could bug out on a moment’s notice and already be completely prepared.

*I have no idea what sort of monumental shit storm it would take to cause the entire club to need to flee, but I’m ready if it happens.*

I also made sure that my new bolt action rifle was in working order, and stowed that along with two full mags in a separate belt pouch entirely. Twenty rounds wasn’t a lot, but it was what I had enough fulminate for after all my testing, and it was probably a lot more than anyone else would have. It wasn’t ideal, since an antimagic field would still cut off my access to it, as it was in an extra dimensional space, but it would do for now. In the long term, hopefully once I got smokeless powder figured out, I’d make a couple of revolvers or a short barrelled shotgun and use the Shrink enchantment to carry it around. That would need to wait though, until I’d done a little more testing with the enchantment, or modified it to suit my needs.  

There was a light knock on the door, which drew me forcibly out of my work, and just after came a little mousey voice, “Quinn?”

I turned to see Minki clutching the door frame, almost hiding behind it. Her shoulder length dark grey hair had been straightened a month or so ago, when she’d been forced by her parents to attend the ball, but I could see that it was starting to return to the tangled mess that was its ground state. I only saw one big grey eye and a bit of her face, but the bit that I did see had turned a little pink, embarrassed at needing to intrude like this.

“Yeah Minki?” I asked.

“Were you maybe thinking about making dinner for tonight?” she asked quietly, “I-It’s getting late, but Kennocha hasn’t gone and ordered any food yet.”

“Sure,” I said with a smile, “Was there anything in particular you had in mind?”

She shook her head, causing her grey hair to fly everywhere, “Whatever works best for you,” she said in a small voice, “But… I would really like it if there was cheese.”

“Cheese?”

She nodded vigorously, and there was more flying hair, “I really like cheese. Pizza is really the best thing ever, and the burgers too, when you put cheese on them, and ham and cheese sandwiches, and there was that time you made the rice with the cheese sauce. I really liked that.”

“Cheese,” I mused, “Hmm, I think I can work with that. It’s not going to be terribly fancy though, not what I have in mind.”

“What do you have in mind?” she asked, and finally she poked her head out the rest of the way, embarrassment giving way to curiosity.

“Grilled cheese,” I proclaimed, and Minki’s eyes lit up.

“W-well if Victorina doesn’t think it’s princessly enough for her, then she can take it up with m-me,” she said confidently, though the intermittent stutter might have detracted a bit from the firm tone.

“If that’s the case then,” I said, standing up and lunging towards her, “Then you can be my little helper as I get dinner ready,” she tried to dodge away, letting out a shriek of laughter, but I caught her. I scooped her up and tossed her over my shoulder, carrying her down the hall and up the stairs to the kitchen, Minki wriggling and giggling the whole way.

----

I set her down on the kitchen counter, and she brushed at her hair, which had fallen to cover her eyes in our trek from the lab.

“So what am I supposed to be doing?” she asked, as I pulled what I’d need out of the cupboards.

“It’s really simple,” I explained, “I’ll show you how to make it, so next time you want a cheesy snack and I’m not around you’ll be able to put something together.”

She pulled a little notebook out of her robes, and set to writing down each of my instructions. It being grilled cheese, it wasn’t terribly complicated, and we found ourselves waiting for the sandwiches to finish grilling.

“Minki,” I asked, “You’re probably the best one to ask about this, but do we have any books on dream magic in the library here?”

“I think so,” she started, before turning absolutely beet red, “Um! I t-think that Halea has a whole bunch of really, um, special, sorts of dream magic books. But if you want the normal stuff, I think Victorina knows better than I do. She’s been really studying a whole lot of dream magic stuff recently.”

“Oh yeah?”

*Oh fuck.*

“Yeah, though I’m pretty sure borrowed Halea’s, um, special books, on the subject too. I’ve seen her reading in the Library, or in the sitting room. Why?”

“Oh, I was just wondering if it would be possible to use dream magic to train or study.”

She nodded, and I managed to avoid going any further down the rabbit hole that was this conversation, only by distracting her with the now cooked sandwiches. It was a big hit actually, and even the rather regal Victorina appreciated the ‘human food’. Minki in particular loved the sandwiches, and somehow, despite being all of four and a half feet tall, managed to wolf down four of the things.

I had quite a bit to think about afterwards, as I was carrying Minki’s tiny form off to bed, the little elf already deep into a food coma.

*If Victorina was able to come into that first dream… then what the hell about the others? Would she do that? Wouldn’t I be able to resist it? I’m supposed to have a greater Will than even other humans, but I have no idea if that would work while I was asleep. I feel like I should be able to sense when someone is casting spells on me, even when asleep, but maybe that’s why the bedrooms of the clubhouse are so heavily enchanted? Would she do that though? What would there really be to gain? Fuck. I know what there is to gain. If dream magic can do what I think it can, you could mess with someone on a subconscious level. You’d be able to train them like you could train a fucking dog, but the rewards and punishments would come on a subconscious level. The subject wouldn’t even know that they were being rewarded or punished, but that positive or negative reinforcement wouldn’t be any less effective than if it was being done on a conscious level. Hell, it was probably more effective to do it this way.*

There was a big question then, and that was what I was supposed to do about it. I cared a whole hell of a lot for Victorina, and I hoped that she did too, but what if she didn’t? What if the whole nympho girlfriend routine was an attempt to control what she saw only as an asset? She was a princess, and one from Adympia no less, maybe I trusted her too much.

*Is that all it takes to stop me from thinking clearly? For someone to wave a pretty woman in front of my face? Fuck, I’m no better now than I was when I first arrived here in Elardia. Sila, Chypia, Thera, and Victorina. It’s entirely possible that I’m terrible at this. For fuck’s sake, Thera’s the most innocent of all of them, if that word can even be used to describe her. Yes, I was a means to an ends for her, but I’m pretty sure we both knew what that end was going to be when we first started. For Sila I was a way out of a bad situation, for Chypia I was a trophy with knowledge of advanced weapons, and for Victorina… Dammit, for all I know, she views me the same way that Chypia did. Worse still, I had to go and blab about my plan to lift the curse.*

And Chypia… when I’d first arrived in Essens I’d made note of the fact that elves seemed rather more trusting than I would have expected comparable humans to be, and I’d carried that forwards to my experiences with Chypia. She had after all given me leave to explore the city after only a week or two in her hands, and I’d chalked that up to the naïve sort of trust that elves seemed to display. But that need not be the case, in fact, it probably wasn’t the case. If anyone here was naïve and overly trusting, it sure as hell didn’t seem to be the elves. So what if I’d violated Chypia’s trust? As far as she’d known, the city was a prison of its own, one that I’d still been trapped inside. It was only because the harbour defences accounted only for elven level endurance that I was even able to escape in the first place. From her perspective, the ‘trust’ had cost her nothing, but had hopefully gained her the trust of the slaves she was working to gain control of.

*The illusion of freedom, without the actual possibility of it, late night swimming adventures aside.*

That readjusted my perspectives a little.

*Just a little.*

Had I seen Diova acting particularly trusting? Had I seen that from anyone in the club? From Lili? From any of my teachers or class mates? I’d dropped into an idyllic peasant village, and assumed that it had been the same there, as everywhere, but that made no sense. Was a nobleman going to show the same naiveté as some ill-educated farmer? Was the royal daughter of an emperor going to be quite as naive as the peasant daughter of an innkeeper?

*No, of course not Quinn, you colossal fucking idiot.*

----

Needless to say, I did not sleep in Victorina’s room that night. I tried to pay careful attention to my dreams, hoping to notice if there was any tampering, but I couldn’t remember any of what I’d experienced come morning. I didn’t sleep very well, but that went without saying. For all I knew, I was a day or two from discovering a heart wrenching betrayal. I didn’t want to confront her though, not now, and not on non-existent evidence. It hurt like hell just to think about it, because dammit, I really cared for her. But I had to know more before I went and put myself out on a limb again.

I spent the whole of that day in the University Library, reading what there was to read on dreaming magic, and on how spells would work on sleeping subjects. I found essentially what I’d expected to find. Firstly, I found that dream magic was a wide enough field of study that anything I’d experienced in the past month had been entirely within her capabilities, assuming she bothered to learn the right spells. And secondly, a sleeping or otherwise unconscious subject would automatically resist any spell cast against them, this was one of the many reasons that for it being so difficult to heal someone that was grievously wounded. If they passed out from their injuries, you’d be trying to push through their natural defences. Of course unless the subject was a Mage, Wizard, or specially trained, those defences were non-existent, but it could still cause difficulties with something as delicate as healing magic. The only exception was when the subject trusted the caster unconditionally, in which case their spells could get through. But that was the trouble, because it was binary. Either you didn’t trust completely, and didn’t let their spells through, or you did trust completely, and did let their spells through. There was no discrimination between the types of spells. Once you let them in, you let in *whatever* they might decide to cast.

*Do I trust Victorina that much? Am I foolish enough to do that? Yes and yes.*

The test then was simple. I was pretty sure that I now no longer trusted her unconditionally. That meant that all I needed to do, was hop back into bed with her. Either she wouldn’t cast the spell, and all would be almost as it was, though something small but important had been lost, or she would cast the spell, and in resisting it, I would wake immediately.

*I really hope I’m wrong.*

# Chapter 58

**Quinn**

-----

We rose before dawn the following morning, and despite the events of the evening prior, I found that I was well rested. I slipped out of Victorina’s room soon after waking, as I wanted to avoid getting caught by a Victorina that might still be feeling some effects of the potion she’d taken the night before.

*Still don’t know how I feel about that, can’t any of my relationships just be normal?*

My preparations for the trip didn’t take very long since most of what I needed was already tucked away in various extra dimensional spaces, so after doing a brief check to make sure that all was still in order I made my way to the kitchen to prepare a proper breakfast. It didn’t take long for the smell of bacon, eggs, and pancakes wafting through the clubhouse to draw in the others, and soon we were all seated around the island in the kitchen.

It was quite the interesting collection of travelling companions, and not exactly what I imagined when I thought of an adventuring party. There was Neferoy, and like Minki she was about four and a half feet tall, though the dwarf was significantly stockier. Her robes were grey silk with black trim, though she had a thick travelling cloak thrown over them to keep off the rain that was still hammering against the windows. Compared to the others her brown hair was short, falling only to her ears in several thick braids. Dwarves, like elves, had oddly huge eyes, and Neferoy’s were the sort of yellow-orange colour that reminded me of an owl. Her skin was pale, though in a slightly unhealthy and sun-deprived way, very unlike the milky white perfection that Halea and Victorina had cultivated. She had squarish features and a prominent nose, which would not have been an attractive combination for a human, but as a dwarf it gave her a dignified presence. Of all of us, Neferoy actually looked like the one that would be most at home on some sort of treasure seeking adventure. The rest of us? Not so much.

Halea, for one, looked like a supermodel. She’d also added a thick wool traveling cloak to her gold robes, but rather than detract from her attractiveness, it just looked absurd. She was slightly above average height, which for an elf woman meant that she was about five feet tall. To say she was slim would be to do her a disservice, because while she didn’t have an ounce of excess fat, the word ‘slim’ might give one the idea that she was somehow narrow in hips and bust. This was very much not the case. Narrow in the waist, very much yes, but her flared hips and very generous bust strained the limits of what was possible. Which did make a lot of sense, now that I knew that Halea’s body from the neck down had been the work of an expensive enchantment. I wasn’t quite sure how much of her face had been the work of similar reconstructive magic, but it lacked the excessive form that the rest of her form seemed to have, so I guessed that it was at least mostly her original face. Like all elves she was sharply featured, with cheekbones you could cut yourself on, and a fine jaw that came to a delicate point. She had night black hair that fell in ringlets to her shoulders, and her huge eyes were a deep violet. Taken together with her skill at battle magic, I was reminded of Yennefer from the Witcher video games.

Victorina shared Halea’s general supermodel like qualities, but where Halea was excessive, Victorina was reserved and elegant. She also wore her normal mage robes under a traveling cloak, and while they were purple which would mark her as someone of rank wherever we went, between the falling rain and the cloak it would be hard to pick out the particular colour once we were out of doors. We were of course still clearly a bunch of Mages up to no good, but at least the purple of Victorina’s robes wouldn’t catch the light like Halea’s gold robes would. She was taller than Halea by several inches, which at about five foot four, meant that she was as tall as even the tallest male elves. Victorina too, had an amazing figure, but it was not quite as extreme as Halea’s. I guessed that it was still the product of some magical modifications, but it somehow seemed more carefully done. Victorina looked unique, while Halea looked more like one of a matched set from the neck down, and if Halea was a little beyond the limit of what seemed naturally possible, then Victorina was a little under. She had similar features to Halea, but seemed somehow more severe, and if Halea’s eyes usually had an amused or smouldering quality to them, then Victorina’s looked more like she was carefully considering how best to kill whatever she was looking at. Her hair was long, falling a little ways past her shoulders, and could be mistaken for a bundle of fine steel wire. When matched with her faintly blue-grey eyes, it added a great deal to her air of general lethality.

And then there was me. Six and a half feet tall, pasty rather than pale, and with what I hoped looked more like a wiry strength rather than an overly skinny frailty. Green eyes, tiny when compared to the elves, and short brown hair, very short compared to most elf men. I had a strong jaw, kept cleanly shaven, and what for a human would have been prominent and sharp cheekbones. I looked like some strange hybrid of races, with a wood elf’s colouring, a dwarf’s facial features, and a giant’s stature. Hopefully that looked better than it sounded. I hadn’t bothered with robes or cloaks, not for this, and had instead worn my Earth clothes. It would be hard to beat them for general traveling wear, and they’d seen me across most of a continent already with little wear and tear. After repairing what damage they had accrued and following that up with an armouring enchantment, they just might be in a state to last forever. I had my dark blue waterproof windbreaker, with my hoodie worn underneath to keep me warm, and it too was dark blue. I had my jeans, which after my adventure in the woods with Victorina had been armoured, and they too were dark blue. The only thing I wore that was not dark and blue, were my Gore-Tex hiking shoes. Those were tan.
*Yeah, no way we’re passing unnoticed.*

“And as far as Ken knows we’re all spending the week in Azarburg?” I asked.

“Yeah,” Halea nodded, “Finding suppliers for more of the reagents and materials you need to destroy the clubhouse.”

“That was *one* time,” I insisted, “And barely any of what caught fire was important.”

“Who’s teleporting us first?” Neferoy asked, considering the map.

The traveling plan was simple, at least for the first phase of the journey. There were three of us in the group that could cast Teleport, *four if you count me*, and the distance between individual villages was just about what a Mage could do with only a map for reference and no teleport beacon at the other end. We’d do three, *or four*, Teleports in quick succession, each one cast by a different one of us, before resting up for a couple hours in whichever town we landed in.

“What about you Quinn?” Halea asked, “You’re supposed to be the one with enervation to spare, you ought to be able to cast it at least twice before you’ve got to rest.”

I shrugged, “Well technically I can cast Teleport,” I explained, “I just don’t know that it’s a great idea. I’ve not done that much work on the spell, I don’t yet have a full grasp of it. If we really need another person casting Teleport then I’ll do it, but I’m wary of Mishaps.”

Mishaps with Teleport were of the sort that were much more frequently fatal, and when they weren’t fatal, they usually left the caster thousands of kilometres from either their destination or their departure point. Aside from death or the possibility of landing in the middle of Adympia, I also harboured the fear that as an Outsider a Mishap with Teleport might even drop me on a different world entirely. And aside from the risk that I would be deprived of magic in such an event, I also didn’t want to be taken from the only group of real friends that I’d ever known.

“That’s true,” Neferoy said, “And I doubt it would matter anyway, Halea, we’ve only got six villages to jump through. Whether we’re Teleporting three, four, or five times before a rest, we’d still end up taking two rest periods before heading off into the forest.”

“It’s,” I glanced at my watch, “Nearly five o’ clock now, so we’d be rested up and starting towards the mine around ten or eleven or so?”

Victorina nodded, “Counting today, we’ll arrive at the mine in the evening of the fifth day out, assuming that the roads marked on Neferoy’s map are grown over and ruined. We’ll make better time if they’re still there for at least part of the way, but we’re still assuming that this trip is going to take a full week. We’ll have all of days six and seven to explore the mine and carry off whatever we can find, though I’d prefer to finish matters by evening of the sixth day.”

“I can agree with that,” Halea said, agreeing with that, “I’d like the chance to spend the last day resting up after this escapade, rather than going to class the morning after we get back.”

“You and Neferoy managed to get that Teleport beacon enchanted then?” I asked Victorina.

She shook her head, “We just went ahead and bought one, it would have taken far too long to enchant ourselves. I’ve got it tucked away in an Extradimensional Handkerchief, and we can drop the thing at the mine entrance once we arrive. If the mine doesn’t pan out we can always come back and pick it up later.”

“Ha, pan out,” I noted.

Victorina raised an eyebrow, “Pardon me?”

“Pan out,” I repeated, “Because it’s a mine? Get it? Pan out?”

She reached out and patted my cheek gently, “I’m sure it was very funny Quinn.”

It was only then that Neferoy and Halea started giggling like a couple of idiots.

----

Our trek north was rather unremarkable, at least from our perspective. For those few villagers that were out in the pouring rain, or that happened to be looking out their windows, I imagine it was a rather odd sight indeed. We left from the front hall of the clubhouse, where an existing beacon lay, and from there teleported to the nearest of the villages. Upon arriving in the middle of the town, suddenly struck by the driving rain, we spent about fifteen minutes standing about as the next of the women prepared their own casting of the same spell. We were never approached by villagers put off by the sudden intrusion into their small towns, but I did notice people observing from windows or from down the street on more than one occasion. If we’d been on foot it would have taken a day of walking to reach the first of the villages, but with the group casting Teleport in turns, we’d made it to the third village in under an hour.

“Well,” Neferoy asked, as we stood in what must have passed for a town square, “What now? I’d say get breakfast, but we’ve done that already.”

“Might as well head to the inn regardless,” I said, “It’s that or stand around in the rain and the mud for the next hour or two.”

There were some general nods of assent, and the four of us stomped through the puddles towards the rough stone and timber structure that was the town’s most prominent building. Like the club it was built three stories high, with a ground floor made wholly of stone, and two upper floors of raw wood. The upper floors actually overhung the first by a significant margin, giving the building a vaguely mushroom like appearance. The floor of the first story, if you could call it that, had probably once been hard packed dirt, but the autumn’s constant rains had long ago turned it to thick mud.

We had a rather immediate effect, upon pushing open the door that led out into the second floor common room. Two super models, one of which was nobility, the other royalty, a dwarf, and an Outsider. We immediately drew the eye of every elf in the room, which with my general social phobia would have been bad enough if there had been only a couple of villagers gathered in the large building. There was more than a couple people here though, a lot more. It seemed as if every elf in the, admittedly tiny, village was gathered here for breakfast.

There were not many children, and not many elderly folk, but for a building with fifty odd wood elves of varying ages packed inside, it was awfully quiet.

Halea- of course it was Halea –decided that now would be a great time to cast a spell, cleaning off all the mud and drying out all of our clothes.

*Because how else might we further draw attention to ourselves?*

The rather gruff looking man at the bar received an elbow in the ribs and a muttered word from the woman standing slightly behind him, prompting him to action.

“Uh, good morn yer highnesses,” said the man, a little uneasily, “Might I find a table fer yerselves?”

“That would be splendid,” Victorina said.

The man, who I guessed was the innkeeper, shot a meaningful glance towards one of the nearer tables, and in an instant it was clear of people.

The others seemed much more comfortable with the attention as they went to sit at the table, and I followed quietly behind. Even Neferoy was from a prominent merchant family, which meant that all of the others weren’t just used to such treatment, they expected it from folks like these. For me though, even with my claim of imperial lineage, it just felt wrong. I was just another man, a very tall, spectacularly handsome, and incredibly intelligent man, that also had magical powers, but still just a man.

*And yet, that’s not going to stop you from claiming all this for yourself, now is it?*

In an attempt to distract myself, I latched on to that thought. If I was going to become lord of all those I surveyed, I figured that I ought to make some notes. So while the others were busy ordering some drinks and making nice with the innkeeper, who was trying his best to adequately serve the actual princess that had graced them with her presence, I took stock.

From the looks of things the town seemed to consist mainly of four or five extended families, which made sense considering the technological and social level of Nimre in general, and this village in particular. There were a few small windows, though they lacked glass, and had only wooden shutters. Those shutters of course had been drawn in against the rain, and they rattled in their frames as the wind and rain beat against them. It wasn’t until I took a good look at the wood of the floorboards and the wall that I figured out the reason for the odd stone-wood construction of the building. The timber, all of the timber, was untreated. It was aged a little, but may as well have been nailed in place a few minutes after the log it had come from was split into boards. Such raw wood, if left at ground level, would probably have started to rot before too long. It was a similar case for most of the other buildings I’d seen in the towns we’d passed through so far, and I guessed that it would be the same for anyone else that couldn’t afford to construct their homes and shops entirely of stone.

*Note to self, invent pressure treated lumber. However that’s made.*

It wasn’t too bad, once I forced myself to relax. It helped that Victorina and Halea were the focus of most of the attention, and “without wanting to be a bother,” there was almost always one villager or another by our table asking if “there was anything they could do to make their stay in Idur any better,” or just generally looking for interesting tales and gossip. Victorina didn’t do much more than exchange niceties, but Halea was happy to relate all manner of interesting gossip.

It was only once we went to leave, that I was forced to undergo the incredible hardship of interacting with another live person. Victorina drew out her silver broach from under her traveling cloak, the one used by the University to handle the transfer of funds, intending like she always did to use it to settle the bill.

It was not, of course, going to work. We were already nearly a hundred and fifty kilometers from Nimre itself, and at least half that from the nearest proper city. Even if the innkeeper had thought to account for the possibility of Mages wanting to pay as they usually did, I doubt that it would have even been possible.

The innkeeper just looked at it blankly for a moment, before realizing just what the broach was meant to do. Victorina glanced at the others, and received a series of helpless gestures.

“Ah, it’s no trouble yer highnesses,” the innkeeper, whose name I still had not learned, said, “It was enough to have you here, think nothing of it.”

Victorina seemed about to agree, but I found that I wasn’t comfortable with the idea of taking the man’s hospitality and walking away without paying. I had also prepared for the likely possibility that the University
credit card wouldn’t work in mind, and had bothered to bring some proper physical drachm along.

“Nonsense,” I said as I stood, “Here you are. And I’ll brook no argument,” I added, when it seemed as if he were about to decline.

“Well thank you your Outsidership, and we’d be glad to have you again.”

-----

“Thank you Quinn,” Victorina said, once we’d left the inn, and were walking a little ways north of the village to start on the next batch of Teleports, “I should have known that the broach wouldn’t work in a place like this.”

“No problem,” I replied.

“Why bother though?” Halea asked, “He didn’t seem to care that much about the money.”

“Maybe,” I allowed, “But he was probably just being polite. In a place like that a little money goes a long way, and it could mean a lot to the innkeeper and his family. And what does it cost me? A fraction of one day’s worth of my bursary. Besides, I’d rather they have a good impression of Mages in general, and that’s a hard impression to perpetuate if every Mage that comes through skimps out on paying when they’re unimaginably wealthy compared to the people in that village.”

“I’d almost forgotten that you lived in a place like that for months before you finally arrived on my front step,” Victorina mused, “Were you working at an inn like that before you discovered your magic?”

“Well I actually found out about the magic by the second week or so, it was just that I didn’t really know any good spells. But I worked as an apprentice blacksmith, not at an inn.”

“A blacksmith?” Halea exclaimed, “What was that like, were you any good? You know Quinn, I was thinking of getting a horse for trips like this, maybe you could shoe it for me?”

I elbowed her playfully, and she dodged away through the rain, “It was like anything else I’ve tried. I picked it up quickly, I did it very well, and I hated every minute of it. Blacksmithing is hard work, and I hate hard work. Not only that, but a forge is really hot, and I can’t stand the heat. Give me winter any day, I’m probably going to melt once Weisse returns and turns this whole place into an oven.”

“You hate hard work?” Halea asked sceptically, “Are you the same Quinn that was around the first couple of months? You were training or studying every waking moment when you first joined us. I remember our training sessions Quinn, I was so tired I could barely stand by the end of it, but then you’d go run off and spend another six hours working with someone else. You know, I’m pretty sure you’re the only member of our club that Victorina has ever needed to pester to work *less*.”

“Magic doesn’t count, magic isn’t work,” I insisted, “And I actually enjoy studying magic. I’m trying to do my best to apply the Batman principle.”

“Batman principle?” Halea asked, giving me an amused look.

“Batman is a superhero, like Antman. But where Antman can do the whole shrinking thing, Batman’s superpower is that he’s rich.”

“Rich?” Victorina asked.

“As in he has a lot of money,” I explained.

“I know what rich means Quinn.”

“And that doesn’t sound very much like a superpower,” Neferoy noted.

“It’s the best superpower!” I exclaimed, “Except maybe for magic. The point is that Batman, given enough time to prepare and enough money to buy what he needs, can solve any problem. Well I don’t have unlimited money, but substitute in magic for the money, and the principle stands.”

“That doesn’t make very much sense Quinn,” Victorina said flatly.

“Well it’s a good thing then that I’ve come prepared. Six nights in the wilderness with nothing else to do, and I’ve got a couple hundred gigabytes of mindless entertainment on my phone. I’m sure I can find some awesome Batman cartoons.”

“Gigabytes?”

“Cartoons?”

# Chapter 59

**Quinn**

-----

Thankfully the inn at our final rest stop wasn’t quite as crowded as the first, and the lot of us managed to get in and out without too much fuss.

And then we got to walk through the woods. A lot.

“Quinn,” Halea proclaimed, “This is the worst! How did you get all the way here from Rhona without dying of boredom? I almost want someone to attack us, at least that would be interesting.”

The four of us were stomping along a narrow game trail, just wide enough for us to walk two by two, with Halea and Neferoy in front, and Victorina and I taking up the rear. We’d been walking for a couple of hours, and would still be walking for a couple more before we made camp for the night. Our pace was a little less than ideal, and between the relatively slow gait of the short elves, their reduced endurance, and the poor terrain, we weren’t going to make it very far each day. I’d suggested having them wait behind at the inn while I walk the teleport beacon out to the mine, but Victorina shot that down on the grounds that they’d prefer not to teleport in at the prearranged time, only to find the beacon sitting in the middle of the forest next to my dismembered body. I of course had a rather higher opinion of my skill at battle magic, but she had a point. And even having them ride along inside the Portable Hole had its issues, since that couldn’t be opened from the inside. An ambush might kill me, and trap the rest of them in a pocket dimension for weeks before someone thought to look for us.

“Well I covered most of the distance by sea, and the distance that was covered on foot was mostly spent in a blind sprint for the border, so boredom wasn’t really the thing foremost on my mind.”

“Right,” Halea said, wincing, “Sorry Quinn.”

I shrugged lightly, “It’s fine Halea.”

Victorina reached up and slipped her arm through mine, and while our differing heights made it a little awkward, I did take comfort in her presence.

“What have you been thinking about then, Quinn?” Victorina asked, shifting the subject away from the less than pleasant memories, “You’ve been pretty quiet this whole time.”

She was right, I had been quiet. The others had been passing the time by talking and sharing University gossip, but I didn’t have much to add, and had remained quiet except when addressed directly. I’d enjoyed being included in their little chat, even if it was only as an observer, but I’d been lost in thought, as was usual.

“Spells,” I said simply, “I’ve been working with Diova and some of his clubmates in my spell invention class, and I’m trying to come up with some ideas that I’d be able to work on with them once we’re done with Solaris.”

“You, short of ideas?” Halea asked incredulously.

“Ideas I can share with Diova,” I clarified, “Not ideas in general. I’ve got plenty of awesome ideas, I just don’t want to share most of them with anyone outside the club.”

“That makes rather more sense,” Victorina said.

“What I’m thinking of right now,” I said, “Given our current situation, is some sort of long distance travel spell.”

“You mean Teleport?” Neferoy asked.

I shook my head, “Probably not. It’s no good if you haven’t been somewhere before, or if you don’t have a map that’s accurate enough.”

“Which is why we’re not using it now,” Halea commiserated.

“Exactly. There are the other options, like your leapy jumpy spell, but they’re energy inefficient. Over a journey of kilometres they’re not going to make a noticeable difference in how far or how quickly you can travel.”

“Some Mages use Summon Horse, basically just a modified Summon Animal,” Neferoy provided, “But that only works if you know the spell incredibly well, enough to run it entirely off of ambient mana.”

“How much does it cost to keep it going?” I asked, “Assuming you’re not getting any cost discounts?”

“Three mana, or energy I suppose, every minute.”

“Damn, even using a huge manastone would be mostly pointless then.”

“Yeah,” Neferoy confirmed, “And then you’d need to wait weeks or months for the stone to recharge. You could use a pocketful of two or three point stones I suppose, but then you’d need some awfully deep pockets.”

“What about flight?” I asked, “There’s got to be a Fly spell out there.”

“There is,” Victorina replied, “But it’s like you said, most spells like that are ‘inefficient’ if you want to travel longer distances..”

“Besides,” Halea added, “Landing is *really* hard. You can cast Feather Fall  along side it, or wear an item with a Feather Fall enchantment, but then the two spells end up fighting each other and you don't go much of anywhere.”

“Something else then,” I mused.

If summoned horses cost so much, then it was unlikely for something like a Tenser’s Floating Disk to be much cheaper. It was something to look into at least, and even if it wasn’t any cheaper I’d prefer that to a horse. An inert floating disk is going to be a much better ride than some smelly horse.

*Assuming that the summoned horse is a normal horse. Could I summon a robotic horse? Or a car? Note to self, learn Summon Car. Failing that, learn how to ride a horse.*

Flight had been my other bright idea, and it was the one that I thought showed the most promise, now that I knew my floating disk idea was unlikely to pan out. I’d need to look at the spell, but I could see how trying to throw a person through the air in some semblance of flight would cost a tremendous amount of energy. Humans, elves, and what have you aren’t terribly aerodynamic, and without any lifting surfaces you’d need to apply at least 1g of force constantly to a mass of thirty to eighty kilograms, depending on the race and size of the caster. For me that meant an energy expenditure of forty mana every three minutes, just to get me airborne.

But that was awful aircraft design. There was a reason that most planes had wings, and not just an array of massive engines to keep the thing in the air. If I could create lifting surfaces out of Apportation style manipulators, and use some sort of modified Fire Jet for propulsion... Well, now there was an idea.

*But not one I’d want to share with Diova. Might need to try the floating disk thing with him after all.*

“Forget about it Halea, he’s gone again,” Victorina laughed, finally drawing me away from my thoughts, “Ask him later.”

“Ask me what later?” I asked distractedly.

“Solaris,” Halea said, exasperation clear in her voice, “How is that coming along? I’d heard that you were trying to design a version that could even hurt elves.”

“Kinda?” I answered, “That was the original plan, but it’s not really feasible. It’ll burn a person, ignite paper, even wood if enough pulses strike the same spot, but pretty much any other spell would be better if you actually want to do damage. It’ll blind the target immediately if you get them in the eyes, but then that’s not so special, since I wouldn’t want to catch an Acid Ball or Magic Missile in the face either. What the new Solaris will do though, is royally fuck up vampires.”

“Oh?”

“Yeah. The old Solaris was mostly just a Firebolt that only worked on Vampires and was a little more powerful given the same amount of mana. The new Solaris though? It’ll punch fist sized holes in anything with a vulnerability to sunlight.”

“Damn,” Halea breathed.

“Well depending on what we find in the mine, you might get the opportunity to test it,” Victorina said.

“You think there might be Vampires in the mines?” I asked, furrowing my brow.

Victorina shook her head, “Ghouls. They’re not quite as susceptible to sunlight as vampires, but I imagine that your new spell will still have a significant effect on them.”

“Assuming there’s any ghouls at all,” Neferoy said.

“Ken is going to be *so* mad once we tell her where we’ve been,” Halea laughed.

------

We stopped that evening, just as the sun was touching the horizon, and made camp next to the game trail we’d been following. The others were confused initially, when I drew a hammock and not a tent from my belt, but pleased once I explained how they’d keep us up off the soaked and muddy ground. It hadn’t stopped raining, not since we’d left that morning, and it didn’t look like it was about to any time soon. I set up a tarp first, stringing it between several trees so that it covered the whole of the campsite, while Neferoy got a fire going. Then I strung a hammock for each of us, along with a cover for each. The cover would keep off any rain blown sideways by the wind, keep out any bugs, and provide some modicum of privacy. Essentially it was a tent, it just happened to be suspended off the ground.

“Quinn!” Halea demanded, once the campsite was set up, “I believe I was promised mindless entertainment?”

“Relax, and give me a couple minutes,” I told her, “I still need to prepare dinner.”

“Yes! I would kill for something to eat right now,” Victorina groaned.

“Well not to worry, the killing bit’s been handled, I just need to cook it. I’ll be back in a bit,” I said, as I climbed down into the Portable Hole.

------

After such a long journey the steak sandwiches I made were a big hit. I might have made something a little more refined if I’d had the inclination, but after walking for hours I didn’t really feel like trying to drag the dining table out of the Portable Hole. Of course, Victorina did find it rather amusing when I mentioned the dining table, but providing her with something delicious to eat quickly shut her up.

“If we’re going to eat this well every night,” Halea said, relaxing in her hammock with her legs hanging over the side, “Then maybe this trip won’t be so bad.”

“You’re welcome,” I smiled, relaxing in my own hammock.

It was a strange feeling, relaxing around the campfire with my friends and listening to the rain. It wasn’t easy to pin down or define, which probably had something to do with it not being terribly familiar, but I decided then that I’d need an awful lot more of whatever this was in the future.

-----

To say that the days passed quickly would be a blatant lie, and even if the food and the company was great, the constant rain and constant walking had gotten old about three hours into the five day trip. I was managing it fairly well, but I was also the best prepared for travel of this sort. I had proper shoes, and a good coat, both of which were made of breathable yet waterproof synthetics. Even my clothing was better than anything you’d be able to find on Elardia, my socks in particular were antibacterial and would help with the damp. The weather grew old eventually, but I had the clothing to stand up to it, and the endurance to put up with the constant walking.

The others, well, they were pretty much screwed from the start. Wool, leather, oilskin, they can all keep the water out to some degree, but natural materials can only handle so much abuse. Eventually they get soaked through, and then all you’re left with is a big sodden weight on your shoulders. Victorina of course could cast her little umbrella spell, but it was taxing to maintain. She might have paid for the spell with only mana and nothing more, but keeping up her concentration on the spell as each individual raindrop struck it was an effort. Granted, it was a wholly mental effort, but it still took its toll over the hours and hours of walking. She only ever managed it for an hour or two each day, before it became too much and she finally need let the spell drop. Their footwear at least was nearly as good as what you might find on earth, having been made bespoke, but again they lacked the benefit of synthetic materials. They might have managed it better if they were more used to walking and if their boots had been properly worn in, but I suspected that they’d not had a chance to do that.

*A princess, a noblewoman, and the daughter of a wealthy merchant family. Probably not a lot of time spent traveling on foot. Damn, just how the hell did I get here again?*

Despite Halea’s best hopes, we avoided any confrontation with hostile wildlife during those five days of walking, and arrived at the entrance to the mine at dusk on the fifth day.

“Well,” I said finally, “This is creepy as fuck.”

“At least it was easy to find,” Halea commented, “Though I think we want to backtrack a little before we make camp.”

“Yeah, safe is not the first word that comes to mind when I look at this place.”

The maw of the mine was pitch black, and the ground around the entrance had been churned up into mud. I could see ragged bits of bone protruding from the ground, that had not yet been washed away, even with the heavy rain of the past several days, along with red streaks that could have only been blood. Taken together the entrance to the mine looked like a gaping, infected, wound in the side of the mountain.

“Ghouls then,” Victorina said tiredly, “I was still holding out hope that it would be uninhabited.”

Neferoy shook her head, “Shelter like this would have been claimed by one animal or another, we’re just particularly unlucky in that it happened to be ghouls that claimed it.”

“At least it’s actually here,” I shrugged, “It almost would have been worse for it to never have been dug, or for it to have caved in.”

“Some of this at least is natural formation,” Neferoy pointed out, “And was here long before the guild decided to mine it. We’ll know more once we look around tomorrow. For now though, I think we ought to beat a path away from here. It’s nearly dusk, and the ghouls are going to come out to hunt soon.”

“Can’t we drop the beacon, and then teleport back to the clubhouse?” I asked, “We could spend the night back in proper beds, and then teleport back in the morning, or even once we’ve taken a couple days to rest.”

Halea shook her head tiredly, “I don’t think I could concentrate enough to teleport more than a couple miles right now, not like this. I’m having a hard enough time staying on my feet.”

Victorina looked to Neferoy, but she shook her head as well, “I haven’t got the energy either. It’s not a bad plan though, I should be able to get us back to last night’s camp at least.”

“Sounds better than walking,” Halea said, “I don’t know if we could get a safe distance away if we were just on foot, not before nightfall.”

“Gather round then, I need to cast the spell before I keel over,” Victorina said, waving the others into a circle.

A moment later there was a brief moment of nausea, and the scenery blinked from the mess near the mouth of the mine, to the peaceful scenery of the forest clearing we’d stopped in the night before. I was a little unsteady on my feet as we landed in the clearing, but the others were obviously suffering more.

Halea looked like she only just managed to stop herself from vomiting, and Victorina reached out to me to steady herself. That was not something she did frequently, and to do it in front of the others showed pretty clearly just how rough a shape she was in, though she’d been hiding it pretty well.

“Quinn,” Victorina asked, once she’d regained her balance, “Can you…”

“Yeah, I got it,” I said, as I set up the camp for what would hopefully be the last time.

-----

Supper was a hearty beef stew, and it might have been simpler even than the steak sandwiches of the first night, but it was filling, and that’s what mattered. I don’t know that the others even cared at this point, and finished the food quickly before climbing weakly into bed.

I was just at that midpoint between sleep and wakefulness, when you get those fragmented bits of dreams, when I was torn back to wakefulness by the rustle of leaves and then the sound of two heavy footfalls in the muck. My heart rate spiked, and for a moment I froze, before quickly and quietly reaching up for the belt pouch that was pinned to the cover above the hammock to retrieve several lead projectiles. My preparations turned out to be for naught though, and I was reassured a moment later by the sound of Halea’s whispered voice.

“No fair,” she said quietly.

“Get your own human,” Victorina hissed back, just before I felt her weight draw the hammock to one side.

I reached over to help her up, and pulled her into the hammock on top of me.

“Hey there beautiful,” I whispered, and I was rewarded with a smile, though I could see the weariness in her eyes, “Not going to bother keeping up appearances?”

“It’s not like they don’t know we’re sleeping together,” she said, as she pulled her shirt up over her head, “And it’s cold,” she stated, wriggling out of her trousers.

“Are you sure you want to strip down?” I asked, raising an eyebrow, “What if this is the night that we’re attacked by a ferocious monster?”

“Then I’ll fight them naked,” she said flatly, undoing the linen wrap that she’d worn in lieu of a corset and letting her breasts free, “Besides, everything aches and itches and is so uncomfortable.”

“That raises the question then…” I said smiling.

“Oh?” She asked, stripping out of the last of her undergarments, “And what question is that?”

“How do I ensure we get attacked as quickly as possible?”

“Oh shut up,” she whispered, unzipping my hoodie.

I’d stayed more or less dressed, in fear of exactly the problem I’d pointed out to Victorina, but had made some notable changes. Firstly, I’d ditched the jeans and the footwear, replacing them with some soft silk trousers that I’d been using as pyjamas since first arriving here. Secondly, I’d put away my shirt, wearing only my hoodie. It was very comfortable, but it did mean that I had to work to hold back a gasp when Victorina snuggled down into me, pressed her cold body against mine and circling my chest with her tiny freezing hands.

“N-no kidding,” I shivered, “You are c-cold.”

She squirmed against me, drinking in the warmth and shimmying further under the blankets.

“How are you still so warm?” she whispered, “How is it that you’ve been able to keep going for these past few days as if none of this bothers you?”

I ran my fingers through her hair gently, the other hand resting lightly on the small of her back, “It’s just how humans are built I suppose. It’s not as if the rest of you haven’t been able to keep up though.”

“I think the only that kept us going was pride,” Victorina replied, “Halea and I weren’t about to let you beat us, and Neferoy didn’t want to disappoint the rest of us. If it had just been us girls though, we would have turned around on that second day. Come back with warhorses maybe, that wouldn’t spook at the sight of the monsters that *didn’t sarding show up dammit.*”

“We should rest tomorrow,” I said, “We’re just going to get ourselves badly hurt if we try to go spelunking like this. I’ve still got plenty of stuff on my phone to watch, so it’s not like we’ll be bored either.”

“Sounds good,” Victorina muttered, and it wasn’t long before she’d finally fallen asleep.

-----

We spent all of that sixth day in the woods relaxing, and I finally made good use of the furniture that I’d been carrying along in my Portable Hole this whole time. Neferoy and Halea each got a nice puffy armchair to themselves, and Victorina and I shared a couch. I sat with my feet up on an ottoman, and Victorina lounged across the couch, with her feet propped up on my lap as I massaged them gently. It was only a minor effort to maintain the illusion that magnified the phone’s screen, and I let myself relax and enjoy watching the show. It was a surreal experience, watching TV in a sitting room that was in the middle of a forest, in the middle of a rainstorm, and at least a hundred kilometres from the nearest settlement of significant size.

“But that’s not equivalent exchange at all!” Neferoy protested, “Where’s the little man with the metal arm getting the energy to make the pillar of rock move? Quinn, this doesn’t make any sort of sense at all.”

“It’s just a show Neferoy,” Halea replied, “But I do wish that the blonde girl would just sard him and get it over with already. The two are obviously perfect for each other, and if he starts to get too grabby she can just pull his arm off. Come on girl, jump on that, don’t be gentle, you can fix him if he breaks.”

*It’s always interesting, hearing Halea’s take on human media.*

“Quinn,” Halea asked, leaning over the arm rest, “When do I get my foot massage?”

“He’s mine,” Victorina sighed, head lolling back, eyes half closed, “I told you, get your own human.”

“Come on Quinn,” Halea taunted, “Just say the word and I’ll get rid of miss smelly feet for you.”

“*My* feet smell?” Victorina challenged, “You’re the one who took two months to learn how to cast Clean.”

“Hush you two,” Neferoy cut in, “Some of us are trying to watch the show.”

# Chapter 60

**Quinn**

-----

We slept in the following morning, and took our time with breakfast before finally teleporting back to the mine entrance. We didn’t want to start in on the mine early, only for a few stragglers to come up behind us and block our escape, and we also wanted to give the ghouls a chance to settle down. Even if the creatures didn’t sleep, they’d hopefully have let their guard down a little which would let us maximize the effect that the surprise attack would have.

“Anything else I should be aware of before we go in?” I asked, as I did one last check of my gear.

“Try not to get bit,” Halea said, while checking her own gear, “Ghouls carry a lot of awful diseases, and you don’t want the wound getting infected. If you do get bit, call out. We’ll pull back to the entrance and see to the wound.”

“You mentioned that ghouls aren’t quite as susceptible to sunlight as vampires, would they be able to follow us out of the mine?”

Halea nodded, “With the weather like it is, yes. Vampires might only survive for a minute or two when the clouds are as thick as this, but ghouls might manage hours. It’s mostly habit and fear that’s keeping them in the mine right now.”

“Assuming they *are* all in the mine,” Victorina cut in, “Ghouls don’t have very long memories, but the weather’s been like this for nearly a week now. Some of them might have figured out that they can afford to hunt a little longer.”

“Do I need to worry about Solaris not working?” I asked.

Halea shook her head, “Don’t worry, ghouls are just as susceptible to *direct* sunlight. If your new spell is as good as you say it is, you’re not going to have any trouble.”

“How do we want to do this?” Neferoy asked.

“Quinn and I take the lead, you two cover our rear,” Halea said, “I want Solaris up front.”

“It might be better if I’m in the back,” I pointed out, “It’s going to be dark in that mine and even if my glasses corrected my vision perfectly, which they don’t, I’d still have a harder time seeing than the rest of you. My ears are a whole lot better though, so I’m going to be able to hear if someone’s creeping up behind us. Besides, if it does come to a fight, I can still fire forwards. I’m tall enough to fire over any of you, and I won’t risk hurting any of you if my aim’s off with Solaris.”

“Right,” Neferoy said, “But if you’re in front, there’s no way anyone in back is going to be able to get a clean shot, not with how narrow the tunnels are.”

Halea nodded, “Alright, Quinn and Vic in back then, Quinn behind me, Vic behind Neferoy.”

“If you’re worried about not being able to see in the dark then are you actually going to be able to hit anything?” Victorina asked me.

“Should be fine,” I replied, “Halea or Neferoy will spot them first, probably Neferoy, I’m guessing you’re used to darkness like this?” I asked, and Neferoy nodded, “And then all I need to do is follow the path of their shots. There should be plenty of light once we start throwing spells around.”

“Well gather round then,” Halea said, “And make sure to conserve your mana. I’ve got no idea how deep the mine goes, and I’d like to clear out *all* of the ghouls if we can.”

*Right…*

I pulled my brass Lee Enfield knockoff out of the belt pouch it had been resting in, and slung it muzzle down over my shoulder as I stepped into a loose circle with the others.

“Are you going to need that thing Quinn?” Halea asked, smirking a little, “If what Victorina’s told me is anything to go by then it’s not as if you lack the enervation.”

I felt my face flush a little, but did my best to control it, “I’ve got plenty, but I need it for everything, not just magic. Spend enough and I’ll be too tired to make a very quick escape, spend even more and I’ll pass right out. You lot can afford to spend every drop of mana, but I’ll be in rough shape if I even get close to empty. I’d prefer not to use this,” I said, bumping the rifle with my elbow, “Because it’s loud as hell, but it’s better than exhausting myself.”

“How are you for manastones?” Victorina asked.

“I’ve still got that cheap ring,” I replied, gesturing with that hand, “And the one point stone I made, so five points total. I should be fine.”

“We’re ready then Halea,” Victorina said, and in an instant, we were gone.

-----

We blinked back into reality an instant later, standing just to the side of the short obelisk that was the teleport beacon. I glanced towards the entrance as soon as we arrived, the others still shaking off their post-teleportation sickness, before quickly scanning the tree line around us.

The imperfections in my glasses and the raindrops spattering the lenses didn’t make it very easy to see, and the constant hush of rain cut down on what I could hear, but I was at least moderately sure that we were safe in the short term. The others each did a quick check of their own upon getting over the nausea, but by that time I was rather more interested in the beacon itself.

“What is it Quinn?” Victorina asked once she too was satisfied with our immediate safety.

“Blood,” I pointed out, “Almost washed away by the rain, but there’s some still there, caught in the coarseness of the stone.”

Victorina bent down to look closer, and I stole an appreciative glance before tearing my eyes away, “Looks like they caught something to eat then,” she mused, “And recently, otherwise the rain would have washed this completely away.”

Halea grimaced, “They’ve been out in the daytime then, let’s hope Quinn’s cute little ears can hear them coming if any more are out and roaming around.”

“Do we want to wait?” Neferoy asked, “Catch any stragglers on the way in?”

Victorina looked to Halea, who shook her head, “We’re not sure if there *are* any more out here, but we do know that the ones in there are probably going to be preoccupied with a meal, if they’re not already asleep. I’d rather capitalize on that, than spend a couple hours in the rain, waiting for something that might not be out here.”

“Fine then,” Victorina said, gesturing towards the entrance, “Lead the way.”

I checked the position of the rifle one last time, and then followed the others into the mine.

-----

A steady flow of water ran down the centre of the narrow tunnel, and I had to set my hand on Victorina’s shoulder to steady myself as it grew harder and harder to see as we stalked further and further into the mine. Idly, and using only gestures, I cast Symbol Drawing before it became too dark to see.

, Cold and Body.
*Yeah, I noticed.*

Aside from the waning light, the further down the tunnel we went, the quieter and colder it became. I could hear only the distant hiss of rain outside, and the occasional chattering of teeth from the others, despite my constant strain to hear more. It wasn’t pitch black, but it was dark enough that my vision was mostly limited to picking out vague splotches. Against the dark background of the rest of the mine, Victorina was a fuzzy splotch of very dark grey, with her shiny steel hair occasionally reflecting what little light there was down here. I wasn’t sure I could see Neferoy, despite her being only a metre or two away. Occasionally I’d pick out a patch of black that wasn’t quite the same colour of the others, but it always seemed to shift and move, and I’d lose track of it quickly. It might just as easily have been my eyes playing tricks, and it made me thankful for the gaudy gold robes that Halea wore. They caught the light, and aside from Victorina’s slight but firm shoulder under my hand, was the only point of reference I had in this blasted cave.

*Victorina seemed to have a harder time picking out the blood on the obelisk. Maybe they’ve got more cones than rods, or rods than cones? Whatever, whichever of the two lets them see better in the dark, but makes it harder to pick out different colours.*

I became more and more uneasy as we crept further down the tunnel, and I frequently found myself glancing back towards the entrance almost without realizing it. The tunnel sloped in such a way that I could no longer see the mouth of the tunnel, and I realized that the floor of the tunnel was starting to level out from the relatively steep grade that it had followed nearer to the entrance.

I cast Symbol Drawing, to reassure myself more than anything, and drew out one of the steel tokens I’d made. I felt across the face of it with my thumb, trying to make out the symbol on it’s surface.

*Like an H, but with two crossbars. Water I think?*

There was a shout from one of the two in front, Halea I thought, and a bolt of lightning went streaking forwards, blinding my dark adapted eyes. Then, like a big stupid clumsy idiot, I slipped.

I let go of Victorina, rather than try to hold on to her to keep my balance, and risk dragging her down with me, and I landed on my back in the shallow stream that rushed down the tunnel. The Water symbol flew from my hand as my elbow thumped hard against one of the large stones that littered the tunnel. I felt a shooting numbness, and reached over with my other hand to check that nothing had been broken. I was fortunate, all I’d done was bump the nerve, my ‘funny bone’, and I’d be fine in a moment.

Then the others opened up, with shouted words and arcane gestures, throwing forwards a stream of fire and lighting. I cast Light slightly behind Victorina, red rather than white, to illuminate the tunnel ahead, but not ruin our night vision. It was my modified version, and was a whole hell of a lot brighter than the spell I’d learned back in Essens. Hopefully it would be enough to blind any enemies rushing towards us.

I pushed myself to my feet, slipping more than once on the slimy stones that made up the bed of the shallow stream, and steadied myself on the near wall.

I could see them now. There were perhaps two dozen of the creatures still standing, and I could see several corpses littering the ground before us, not all of them ghouls. The tunnel had opened up into a wide cavern just ahead of where Neferoy and Halea were standing, though the ground fell away into blackness on the one side. The stream that had flowed down the tunnel cascaded down into that chasm, and the red glint of my spell shone briefly off of my Water symbol as it followed the path of the stream to slip over the side.

*I can replace that later, for now though, time for a little field testing.*

I picked one ghoul at random, pointing towards him with my still slightly numb arm, and fumbled through the gesture for Solaris. I’d decided to start small, I needed to conserve my mana, and I could always hit him again if it turned out not to be enough.

Well, it was enough. More than enough.

I cast the spell and there were three crackling zaps in quick succession, each one a pulse of pure sunlight. It was more than pure actually, at least as far as these ghouls were concerned. Sure, this version of Solaris focused the light into a laser, concentrated in three short pulses, rather than using an ill-defined beam as the original version did, but that was only the half of it. The original Solaris used sunlight, yes, but only sunlight as it was after passing through the ozone layer and about sixteen kilometres of atmosphere. The new Solaris… *Solar Pulse,* used sunlight without such adulterations, and at this intensity, it might as well have been sunlight direct from the surface of a star. Needless to say, it was effective.

The ghoul fell forwards mid run, as if someone had cut its legs out from underneath it, and the ruddy light of my spell illuminated the smoke and steam that rose from the hole in its back.

“Oh yeah!” I shouted, “SCIENCE, BITCH!”

The rapid *zap-zap-zap* of Solar Pulse joined the deep, rumbling concussions of thrown Firebolts slamming against the ghouls, the ground, and the far wall, and the thunderclap of passing Lighting bolts, as we started to empty the cave of living ghouls. We held fast just inside the tunnel, keeping our flanks secure as the thin limbed creatures scrambled towards us on all fours. They looked like something halfway between an elf and a big lizard, with grey pebbled skin and long thin claws on the ends of too-small hands. Their faces were *deep* into the uncanny valley, with already thin skin stretched tight over the front of a too small skull, and huge jaws that each held what must have been a hundred needle like teeth.

They were tough though, despite the almost skeletal thinness, and except in the case of Solar Pulse, each was able to endure several hits before falling. And they were falling, but a little closer than was comfortable, with more than one sliding to a stop within inches of Halea or Neferoy.

“Halea,” I shouted, “Call your targets, Victorina and Neferoy, concentrate your fire on Halea’s calls!”

The others didn’t argue, and at Halea’s first call of, “Close right!” a ghoul fell to a hail of fire and lightning.

I forced myself to calm, taking each shot deliberately, casting the spell with one hand, while aiming with the other, thinning the crowd for the others to finish off. Time passed slowly, and it felt like the fight took ages, even though it couldn’t have lasted more than a minute. Eventually though we’d cleared the cavern of living ghouls, if the creatures could be called ‘living’, and we could finally catch our breath.

I could still hear some distant scrabbling, the sound of something scraping stone, though it was muffled by the steady trickle of the stream and the rush of blood in my ears, and I cast another light into the cavern to illuminate the space beyond.

“Yes!” Halea shouted, “Sard yes!”

Crystals, what must have been thousands of them, covered the walls and ceiling of the cavern, catching, reflecting, and refracting the red light of the spell. The effect was like some sort of bloody discoball, and it made the scene below all the more gruesome. The ghouls had not died prettily, and neither had they killed prettily. Joining the scattered and dismembered bodies of the ghouls were the remains of what must have been a week’s worth of meals. Whole rib cages, animal skulls, and long thick bones, all stripped bare and still glistening red with blood. The odd hunk of meat too, could be found, where a ghoul had been interrupted in the midst of its meal. The whole cavern reeked of blood, and rotting flesh, and I could see still more tunnels branching off from this chamber.

*And with my luck, there’s more ghouls waiting to creep out.*

I glanced back up our escape tunnel, checking to see that it was still clear, as the others started to pick their way over the bodies.

*Royalty, nobility, and the wealthy, but let no one say that they’re too dainty to get their hands dirty. I would have expec-*

There was an arm visible among the bodies and carrion, and not the arm of a ghoul. I bounded forwards, past the others and over the collected corpses of the ghouls. It stuck up from under the body of a fallen ghoul, and was small and pale, like the arm of a child. I kicked the ghoul away, revealing the rest of what was trapped underneath. There was not much more to reveal. Up to the elbow, the arm might have been perfect, with not a mark on it. From the elbow up, was nothing but ragged and bloody bone, and the arm ended all together at what once would have been the poor child’s shoulder.

I had to work to steady my breathing, and keep myself from shaking, I could feel a panicky, blind terror threatening to overcome me, and had to force it down.

*The Water symbol, where is the Water symbol?*

It was a strange fugue that settled over me, and I kicked through the bodies looking for the symbol, certain that finding it would somehow make everything better.

*A child, a child, a child, a child, a child…*

I was deaf to the world, only the odd muffled word from the other getting through, as I looked desperately for the damned steel symbol. They were gibbering something about crystal quality, which of all the things on my mind, was last on my list of priorities.

*Waterfall.*

I tore my gaze away from the bodies, and towards the black pit that fell away to one side of the cavern. I stumbled towards it, tripping over the tangled limbs of the twisted corpses, finally reaching the side of the pit. It was perhaps fifty feet down, to the surface of a pool of black water that shone red in the light of the spell above. It was full of discarded bones and bits of bodies, and had evidently been how the ghouls disposed of their cast offs. At the far side of the pool was a narrow shelf of stone, like some sort of sick beach, and lying on it was the Water symbol. And next to it…

*Oh god.*

A small body, in brown robes, with a thick mop of grey hair. It was face down, half in the water, half out, one arm extended as if towards the token, and the other gone at the shoulder.

There was a scream from behind me, keening and high pitched, the sound someone makes when they’ve been pushed far beyond what they can endure mentally and physically.

*No no no no no no no…*

“NO!” I roared, and turned, arm raised towards the screaming.

There was Halea on the ground, with the jaws of a ghoul, one we’d thought dead, around her ankle. Behind her was Victorina, trying to lunge towards her, to blast or kick at the ghoul, but she too had an attacker. Another ghoul, evidently from one of the side passages, had both of its clawed hands buried in her hair and was pulling her backwards and off of her feet. Neferoy was still standing, and still whole, but couldn’t help either of her friends as she was busy contending with another half-dozen ghouls, pouring out of a side tunnel.

I screamed the incantation to Solar Pulse, barely conscious of the power I was putting into the spell, and then the ghoul attacking Halea was just… gone. In another instant, just as the ghoul was pulling Victorina’s head back to bare her neck, it too was *gone.*

I turned to the six, now eight, ghouls that Neferoy was holding off, and they too died. I still hadn’t stopped screaming, but I managed to moderate my energy usage. The adrenaline, rage, and fury, would as much as double my available enervation, but once I came down off that high, I’d end up paying for what I’d used, one way or another.

The last of them fell, and I ran back to the edge of the pit, barely sparing a glance to see if any more had come.

“Quinn!” Victorina screamed, “We need to *go!*”

“Then go!” I roared, before leaping into the pit.

I fell thirty feet straight down before the ring caught me, and I glided across to the far side where I landed lightly on the shelf of stone that rose just up out of the water. I grabbed the tiny body by the back of its robes, pulling it out of the water and flipping it over. It was light, too light, and I saw immediately why. Everything from the navel down was just, gone. Her eyes, Minki’s eyes, were closed, and her expression was peaceful, in a sick and twisted contrast to her badly mangled body.

I went cold, not allowing myself to feel, not allowing myself to fall into the gibbering insanity that would follow if I let myself think of this as anything more than a puzzle. I glanced at my watch, in case Time would be the answer to my puzzle.

*Oct-21, 10:43*

I picked up the Water symbol, coldly placing it back with the others, just as I heard someone land on the stone beside me.

“Oh gods,” came Victorina’s wailing cry, “Oh Halaosil, no, no, no, why Minki?”

I ignored her, and focused instead on the puzzle before me.

I cast the MRI spell Nothus had taught me, looking for some clue, anything that would explain how or why this had happened.

It didn’t tell me anything I didn’t already know, except…

*Her lungs are full of water, oh no, oh god… She drowned… she was still alive when they threw her down here.*

I forced myself away from that chain of thought, forced myself away from thoughts of just how long it had taken her to die, and focused instead on what useful information could be gleaned from this data point.

*She drowned, the water is freezing… The symbols, the first two, ᚺ and ᛊ, Cold and Body. The blood on the obelisk was fresh, her blood? Three to five minutes, that’s how long brain cells stay viable past death, but with the water as cold as it is… Human children who’ve fallen through the ice and drowned have been resuscitated as much as thirty minutes later, but dammit, she’s not human, and not a child… What about the body? It’s not viable, it needs to be reconstructed. Fuck, even with all I’ve learned I don’t know enough to build an entire body for her.*

“Quinn,” Victorina mewled, turning her face away from Minki’s mangled body, and pressing it into my chest, “We need to go, we need to go.”

I could hear fighting above, Neferoy’s deep voice shouting incantations, and Halea’s voice, barely hanging on, doing the same.

***I*** *don’t know enough to build an entire body.*

I pushed Victorina away, and threw myself up and out of the pit, landing hard on the cavern floor above. There weren’t many more ghouls, only four or five of them, but they were coming, and Neferoy and Halea were barely holding them off. Halea herself was still on the ground, and I saw that her right leg between ankle and mid-calf had been bared right to the bone.

I cast Solar Pulse as rapidly as I could, throwing the spell from each hand, and the last of the ghouls dropped just as I made it to Halea. I bent down next to her and cast Heal, and she screamed again, screamed and screamed until she had no more breath, but when the golden glow of the spell had faded her leg was whole again.

“Quinn,” she gasped, “That was amazing, I thought I was going to lose that foot.”

“You’re welcome,” I said absently, as I started to cast Teleport.

*Where, where where where, where would she be on Satyrday morning?*

“Quinn,” Halea asked, eyes wild with alarm, “Where the hell are you going?”

“The University,” I said simply, “I’ll be right back, make goddamn sure you hold this cavern for me.”

And then I was gone.

-----

I snapped back into reality outside the mine, at the obelisk we’d laid here, that Minki had evidently used to reach the mine.

I cast again, and again I was gone.

-----

I felt fatigue wash over me as I landed in the front hall of the clubhouse, and I realized that I didn’t have much time. I’d already drained my manastones, and I was probably only a few minutes from crashing hard.

*To hell with it.*

I cast again, this time with vitality, and blinked away just as I heard someone start to call out from the balcony above.

----

I landed in Professor Nanna’s office, and felt a sudden tearing sickness. Not like nausea, not like the sickness of a rough teleport, but like the sickness of having just been kicked roughly in the stomach.

*So that’s what it’s like to cast with vitality.*

“Goodness grief,” came Professor Nanna’s shocked exclamation, “You scared me half to death Quinn, you ought not to barge in like this, I know you’re an eager student, but I’m tutoring Nothus now.”

*Nothus! Yes!*

And there she was, sitting across from Professor Nanna, looking like some elven Dwayne Johnson. She looked surprised, though that passed quickly, and then without a word, she extended her hand towards me.

I took it, and with barely a conscious thought, we were gone.

----

In an instant we were in the clubhouse, and then at the entrance of the mine, and the back in that damned cavern, each jump feeling like a savage kick in the gut.

Nothus, to her credit, seemed even less fazed by the rapid teleportation than I was, which was helpful, since I hadn’t even thought to give her a chance to rest at each jump.

“Where Quinn?” she asked, “And who?”

I pointed towards the dark pit, dimly aware of the others who had taken up guard positions throughout the cave, “Minki.”

She ran to the edge and leapt down, and I stumbled after her. It was fortunate that I had the ring, I didn’t think I’d be able to cast Leap if my life had depended on it. Nothus hadn’t been run so ragged though, and landed lightly next to Minki. I barely kept to my feet as my ring let me lightly down, and had to brace myself against the wall. I was startled by the sound of another pair of boots landing next to me, and felt Victorina take my arm to support me.

“Quinn,” Victorina pleaded, hugging my arm, “Enough, we have to go. She’s dead Quinn, not even magic can bring her back, not if you want her to truly be alive.”

I looked up to meet Nothus’s gaze, “Can you repair the body, without touching the brain?”

“It’s going to take an immense amount of energy,” she said, shaking her head, “And she’ll still be dead when I’m done Quinn.”

“Quinn,” Victorina begged.

“Repair the body,” I said firmly, “I’ll provide the energy, and I’ll take it from there,” I pulled my arm loose of Victorina’s grip, and lurched forwards, putting a hand on Nothus’s massive shoulder, “Do it, and spare no expense.”

Nothus nodded solemnly, closed her eyes, and began to cast. Just like that first time, when I’d let Victorina use a bit of my energy, I allowed Nothus the same, but where I’d given Victorina a portion of my enervation, I gave Nothus a tiny piece of my soul to work into a new body for Minki.

And it was a *new* body. Nothus didn’t just replace what was missing, she reworked what was already there. The changes weren’t drastic, some of them might not have even been conscious on her part, but I noticed the differences. She seemed stronger, firmer, somehow more than she was before. That’s not to say that Nothus tried to pattern her off of Halea, turning her into some buxom underwear model, or off of Nothus herself, turning her into the world’s shortest body builder. No, it was still Minki, but it was Minki *Plus*.

“Quinn?” Nothus asked gently, “Are you sure?”

“Necromancy-“ Victorina pleaded.

I cut her off, “Not necromancy,” I growled, “Science, done every day on Earth, without a speck of magic involved.”

“Oh,” Nothus breathed.

“Yeah,” I nodded, crouching down beside Minki, “I can manage breathing and circulation, but I haven’t got the juice to create the adrenaline, can you manage that?” I asked, almost begging.

“Yes Quinn,” she promised, kneeling down to Minki’s other side, “Yes.”

Einstein would throw a fit, and it violated pretty much every law of physics, making a mockery of e=mc^2, but you could ‘create’ matter with magic. Acid Jet, Water Jet, and the like were proof of that, but that matter would disappear, given time. The question then, was how to make it permanent. The answer of course, was to use more mana, more *energy*, a lot more. A version of Acid or Water Jet that created matter permanently was prohibitively expensive, demanding about a hundred times as much mana as the regular version, but it worked. As an alternative then, you could try to create one percent as much matter. If you wanted to make gold, well then that was a losing battle, you could make more money working a regular job than you could out of selling the gold you *created.* But then, I didn’t need gold did I? I needed adrenaline, and for Minki, who weighed even less than eighty pounds, I only needed a little.

I cast two different spells, one to apply gentle pressure directly to her heart, causing the blood to start to flow through her new body, and another to begin manual respiration. In some cases, perhaps three percent, that would be enough, but I wanted better odds than three percent.

“Do it,” I growled, and Nothus cast our spell.

There were other drugs involved in resuscitation, none of which I knew the names of, and none of which I could define adequately for a spell, but I knew that adrenaline was the most important of all of them. It would need to be enough. I had a defibrillator spell, it was one of the first that Nothus and I had put together, but real life is not like the movies. A defibrillator isn’t used to restart a heart, it’s used to shock a heart back into normal rhythm. If the heart isn’t beating in the first place, then it doesn’t do a damned thing. I just had to hope that this would be enough, I didn’t have any idea of success rates, I didn’t know if Minki’s brain was still viable, I had no ide-

Minki started screaming, and it came so suddenly that it felt like a slap in the face. I threw myself backward awkwardly, startled by the sudden noise, and stunned that it had worked. Nothus was equally taken aback, but snapped out of it a moment later, and we both leaned in to take hold of Minki. She was still screaming and thrashing, eyes wild, and scared out of her mind.

“Minki,” I said gently, “Minki I’m here, you’re alright.”

She seemed not even to notice, and I looked up at Nothus. I had no idea what to do, and was quickly reaching the end of my rope.

“Nothus, the brain, is she…”

“She’s there,” she assured me, “But…”

“But what?” Victorina hissed, finally coming to grips with what Nothus and I had just done.

“She remembers,” Nothus explained, “Remembers *all* of it.”

*Fuck, yeah, I see how that could be bad.*

“I have a spell…” Nothus began.

“No!” Victorina growled, staring Nothus in the eye, “I’m not letting you rearrange her mind.”

“Can you make her forget?” I asked.

“No!” Victorina growled again, this time levelling her angry gaze at me.

“I can suppress the memories,” Nothus replied, “They’ll still be there, but they’ll only resurface slowly. It might take years for her to get it all back.”

“That really doesn’t sound like a bad thing,” I said quickly, “Victorina,” I pleaded, still trying to keep Minki from hurting herself with her constant thrashing, “She *needs* to forget, at least for a little while.”

“Fine,” Victorina relented, “Do it before I change my mind.”

“Do you have any idea of how far back I need to go?” Nothus asked me, “I don’t want to take out too much, or too little.”

I grimaced, “Is it going to be that much of a problem if you wipe out everything since she woke up this morning?”

“Yes,” she said forcefully, “*Any* sort of memory reworking can have ripple effects, even when it’s only a matter of a few hours. It’s not a perfectly understood area of magic, she might lose bits of other memories too, even if I only take a few minutes. We want to suppress exactly as much as we need to, and not a second more.”

I looked down at my watch, working backwards with the thirty minutes in the water as a starting point, and trying to work out some sort of sick arithmetic with how long she would have otherwise lasted if she’d been bleeding out.

“One hour, fifteen minutes,” I decided on finally, “If that doesn’t get it all, well, hopefully it’ll be something she can endure.”

She started in on the ritual, taking her time with work so delicate, and I held Minki’s hand tightly as the wild screaming subsided, and she started whimpering weakly. It must have only been a few seconds, though it felt like hours, before Nothus finally finished the ritual. Minki shuddered and let out a slow breath, her eyes fluttering closed, and I worried for a moment that I’d lost her again. She came to a moment later though, and this time she seemed okay.

I couldn’t help it, I started crying. I managed to hold back any sobs, but the tears streamed freely down my face as I hugged Minki’s hand to my chest.

“Quinn?” Minki asked shyly, in her little mousey voice, “Are you okay? Why are you crying?”

I only dimly made out Minki’s next question, something about asking where she was, as I finally ran out of steam, and crumpled to the ground.

# Chapter 61

**Quinn**

-----

I woke, to find it so dark that I could barely see, and for one terrified instant I thought that I was still in the cave. I was reassured a moment later when I realized that the feeling against my cheek was of smooth silk, and not rough stone. The rushing of water I heard, that was the beat of rain against the windows, and not the run off from the tunnel cascading down into that awful pool. The dim shapes of the room eventually resolved themselves, and I found myself lying in my bed. The curtains had been drawn across the windows, and in the thin sliver of moonlight that slipped through the gap I could just make out Victorina sleeping peacefully. And between us was an odd lump of blankets, topped with a mop of grey hair.

*Minki.*

She’d evidently dragged some of the covers off of her own bed and snuck in here to snuggle up between us. I found it hard to fault her, and was just thankful that she seemed to be okay. She was sleeping soundly, and seemed in fact to be in even better shape than I was. I couldn’t know for sure, but I hoped that she wasn’t wracked by awful dreams of her encounter in the mine.

*Dreams, right…*

I glanced at Victorina, well aware that my suspicions were still unresolved, but pushed those thoughts away for the time being. I was enjoying a touching moment goddammit, and I wasn’t about to ruin it by getting myself all worked up about potential betrayals.

I drifted off to sleep a little while later, and if my dreams weren’t pleasant, at least I didn’t remember them afterwards.

-----

I caught Minki alone in the library a little after lunch, and found her in her little corner of the library, up on the second floor balcony. She was sitting on the floor, with her back to the solid oak shelves, her nose buried in a book. She looked up as I stepped around the corner, and smiled shyly when she saw who it was.

“You’re looking better,” she said softly, and I couldn’t help but choke out a dark laugh.

“*I’m* looking better?” I asked incredulously, shaking my head, “Fucking hell Minki.”

“Sorry Quinn,” she said quietly.

I collapsed next to her, not quite tired, but somehow weakened.

*Probably the result of repeatedly casting with vitality.*

“It’s not…” I sighed, “What happened Minki? Do you remember?”

She nodded slightly, “I was bringing breakfast,” she explained, “I made you all grilled cheese sandwiches, just like you showed me. Ken told me that you’d all gone off to Azarburg, I had no idea you were going to any sort of mine, I thought I’d just be surprising you all for breakfast…” she shrugged, and looking down at her lap, her hair hiding her expression, “The last thing I remember is wrapping up the sandwiches. After that, I’ve only got Halea’s account to go on.”

“She explained what happened?” I asked softly.

“Yeah,” Minki nodded, “And Nothus too, she hung around just long enough to explain how you two healed me. So I guess I don’t know any more than anyone else does.”

I took off my glasses, and stared up at the ceiling, letting out a long breath.

“I’m sorry Minki, leaving the beacon there was my idea. It was my fault, we should have kept it with us. The couple of mana we saved by using the beacon wasn’t anywhere close to worth the risk.”

“You couldn’t have known Quinn,” she said gently.

“I should have known dammit,” I insisted, though I still couldn’t bear to look at her, “And none of this would have even been a problem if we’d just told Kennocha. Instead we snuck off like a bunch of idiots.”

“People make mistakes Quinn and- Hey!” she interrupted me, before I could voice a retort, “Even you, and you managed to fix it. It’s alright, I’m alright, and even if you could have done it differently, it turned out okay in the end.”

“It could have turned out very not okay,” I said bitterly, “Fuck, that could have gone so badly. All for what, some cheaper manastones?”

“You don’t need to worry about taking risks because you’re worried about what might happen to me, Quinn,” she insisted, “You had good reasons for exploring the mine, and you still managed to bring back what you went there for. Just, maybe, you learned some things for next time?” she asked leadingly.

I snorted, and finally dropped my gaze from the ceiling, “Yeah, let the rest of you know what the hell is going on.”

*Problems that can be solved with a sticky note, shouldn’t be problems.*

“And if Kennocha doesn’t like it,” I continued, “Then she can deal with it, but at least she’ll know. That wasn’t all I learned though, hold on,” I said, digging around in one of my pouches.

I cast Symbol Drawing, and drew out a symbol.

----

    ᛬

----

“What is that?” Minki asked, leaning over to peer at the little steel token.

“The ‘Separate’ symbol, used in symbol divination,” I explained, “Are you familiar with that type of magic?

She nodded, “Were you using this in the mine then?”

“Yeah, yeah I was. The more I use these, the more I realize just how accurate they tend to be. And it’s not just a matter of what they tell me when I draw them, not unless what happened in the mine was a fluke, and I really doubt that.”

“What happened?”

“I drew out the Water symbol, just before we made first contact with the ghouls. And then I dropped it,” I explained, “It got carried along by the stream running through the tunnel, and fell over the edge and into the pit. That on its own was unremarkable. What is remarkable, is that when I peered over the edge of the pit, I saw it lying next to you.”

“It lead you to me,” she breathed.

“Yeah,” I nodded, “These are made of steel, which is not known for floating. It should have sunk to the bottom, but instead…”

She sat there for a good minute, thinking quietly and not speaking, before she finally pushed herself up off the floor. She sat down in my lap, and slipped her arms around me, leaning her head against my chest.

“However you managed to find me and bring me back, thank you Quinn,” she said, “And know that I don’t blame you for what happened.”

I hugged her back, holding her tightly to my chest. Of all the people in the club, Minki seemed the most innocent, the most vulnerable. Losing her would have been bad enough, but to be the reason it happened?

*Pretty sure that’s how I’d make the switch from cunning hero to maniacal madman.*

“What about you Quinn?” she asked, once we’d pulled a little apart, “Are you alright? Nothus said that you’d spent some of your soul to bring me back.”

“I’m fine,” I replied, “I didn’t use much soul, only a year of my life. I’m immortal, I can deal with the loss of a year. I do feel rather drained after spending so much vitality to teleport around, but I’ll recover eventually.”

“I… I don’t even know what to say Quinn,” she said quietly, though there was a seriousness to her tone, a persistence, “To say that I owe you my life doesn’t do it justice. Whatever Nothus says, I was dead. Really really dead, even if I don’t remember how it happened. But you brought me back, and had to spend a sliver of your own life to do it. It’s the stuff of legends or heroic epics, Quinn. I…” she trailed off helplessly, “I’m not really very good at talking about how I feel, but Quinn, I don’t know anyone else that could have imagined a way of using healing magic anything like what you did, let alone actually do it. H-how much soul do you even have left after that?”

“Probably between sixty or sixty five years’ worth,” I shrugged, “Maybe eighty if I’m really lucky.”

“Quinn…” Minki breathed, aghast at what I’d done.

I waved one hand dismissively, “If you’re about to tell me that I’ve gone and done too much, or that humans haven’t got a whole lot of soul to spend in the first place, then you can keep it to yourself. Maybe you’re used to being treated as a second class citizen or as a piece of property because you happened to be born a woman, but as far as I’m concerned you’re worth ten times the price I paid.”

She was taken aback by this, and speechless for nearly a minute before she could finally find her voice again, “I don’t know what worries me more, how crazy that sounds, or how serious you look when you say it.”

I shrugged, “You’re worth it Minki.”

-------

“Quinn,” Victorina growled sleepily, “Just where are you going this early?”

“Battle magic class,” I replied, as I fumbled around on the nightstand for my glasses.

“Quinn,” Victorina hissed, “You should be resting.”

“I’ve already missed a week of class,” I said gently, “I don’t want to miss any more unless I need to. I’m not going to strain myself, I’m just going to be sitting in a comfy chair, that’s it, I promise.”

She sighed, and flopped back into the bed, “Fine, you remember the story we all agreed upon?”

“My sudden intrusion into Professor Nanna’s office to pick up Nothus was done to save Halea’s leg, Minki didn’t teleport to the mine, Minki wasn’t even there,” I recited.

Professor Nanna of course had demanded an explanation once we returned, and it wasn’t really going to be possible to hide the generalities of what we’d done. So we told her most of the truth, and kept back only that which could be the most damaging. Technically speaking what Nothus and I had done was perfectly kosher, but that didn’t mean everyone else would agree with our assessment of the facts. Besides, the last thing Minki wanted was for half the University to start prying into her business, either studying her as a new stage in the development of healing magic, or watching her for fear that she’d turn out to be some sort of new necromantic creation. Once I regained consciousness and had the plan explained to me I wholeheartedly agreed, largely for the same reasons as Minki. The last thing I wanted was for more people to start bothering me.

“Have fun,” she muttered, before rolling over and going back to sleep.

-----

Battle Magic, as I’d insisted, was no great strain. I was asked about Solar Pulse about a million times, word had evidently gotten out, but I managed to beat back the onslaught of questions by promising that it would be ready ‘soon’.

Spell Invention was what I’d really been looking forward to though, after all, it would give me the chance to do a little showing off. And it was all the better if Diova had already heard some of the rumours.

I got more than a couple jealous looks from the other students as I sidled into class just before it was due to start, and took my seat with Diova and his little clique.

“Quinn,” he said evenly.

I nodded in reply, “Diova.”

“I suppose we need not waste time attempting to get Solaris to work on elves and humans.”

“Not much point now,” I answered, “And by the way, I’ve decided on a name.”

“Oh?”

“Solar Pulse.”

“Hmm, succinct, and it gets the point across. I approve.”

“Thank you.”

“What did you have in mind for the future?” he asked, looking at me out of the corner of one eye, though he remained facing the teacher.

“Well we’re months ahead of schedule,” I replied, “Let’s take the time to touch up some of the more hacky solutions we used along the way-“

“-The issue with the mirrors for example.”

“Exactly, we get the spell into a teachable state, and then sell or trade the rights to the University,” I said quietly, so as not to disturb the class.

“I must say, I’m rather fond of the idea of leaving a lasting legacy at the University. We should talk more once he’s finished lecturing,” he said, nodding towards the professor.

----

“What’s that?” I asked, nodding towards the loosely bound sheaf of parchment that Diova was thumbing through .

We’d already hammered out the specifics of what was left to be done with Solar Pulse, and were enjoying a rather empty café while tossing around ideas for just what spell we’d be working on next. Baron Bronippo and Tosa had shared some interesting, if unworkable, ideas with the rest of us, but had mostly subsided once each of them was shot down by either Diova or me. Mata had been present briefly, though she’d said fewer than a dozen words before finally being… dismissed? by Diova.

He pushed the- well, it actually looked an awful lot like the medieval equivalent of a magazine, across the table towards me, before taking a sip of his tea.

I flipped it open to the first page, and stopped short. I looked down at the magazine, trying to make sense of what I was seeing and failing utterly, before looking up at Diova.

His brows drew together, “Is something the matter?” he asked, over the rim of his teacup.

“Ah, what is this?” I asked, pointing down that the parchment magazine.

“What does it look like?” he asked, looking at me askance.

“It *looks* like soft-core porn.”

Diova nearly spat out his tea, and I got a chuckle out of the other two.

“Well you asked,” I said defensively.

“It’s a catalogue,” Diova said, once he’d checked his robes.

“A catalogue of...?” I trailed off.

“Shape changing magics,” Diova said dryly.

“For…”

“Mata,” Diova said firmly, at the point of exasperation.

*At least Tosa and the Baron seem to find it hilarious.*

“Really? Hmm,” I mused, “Though I’m still a little unclear on just what her role is supposed to be.”

“With respect to me, or my club in general?” Diova asked.

I shrugged, “Either.”

“She takes notes, carries my books for me, and other such things,” he explained, “As you can imagine, she’s a little more useful in my other classes.”

“And she sucks his cock,” Tosa said, laughing coarsely.

Diova gave Tosa an irritated look, but didn’t deny it.

“What?” he asked defensively, noticing my expression, “She’s a servant, I treat her as such. It’s not as if I abuse her like some would, she does her task diligently, and I pay her well for it. Though I do wish she’d dress better, and not neglect herself so much, it’s no good to have my servants appearing so dowdy and plain.”

“She doesn’t seem like someone with much money,” I noted.

He waved a hand dismissively, “She sends her bursary and almost all of what I give her back home to her village.”

“Which is why she wears such simple clothes, and orders water when we go to places like this,” I said in understanding.

“Exactly,” he nodded.

“And you’re going to ‘fix’ that?” I asked.

“It’s why I picked Mata in the first place. She’s very intelligent, as peasants go, and I’ve known from the start that I’d be able to alter her to better suit my tastes once I found the time.”

*Servants made to order, not that unlike Chypia’s two chamber slaves.*

“You don’t approve,” he observed.

“Can’t say that I do,” I said, standing.

“Most people are not blessed with the allure of an outsider, Quinn.” Diova said, as I buttoned the front of my robes, “The rest of us must make do with what we have.”

*Maybe I’d be a little more sympathetic if that same point was being made by someone other than the heir to an entire kingdom.*

“I’ll see you tomorrow Diova,” I said, before drawing up my hood and stepping out into the rain.

----

I showed up for my Healing class later that week, though I rarely actually stayed for the lectures any more. I was well aware that it could just as easily be a matter of arrogance, but there just wasn’t a whole lot to be gained by going. Nothus already knew whatever I hadn’t already known, and whatever she didn’t know, I did. There were a few little niggling details that Professor Nanna could point out to us, and there were still of course the actual spells to learn, but I didn’t want to sit through a four hour lecture for all of five minutes’ worth of useful information, and the spells I could learn on my own.

Thankfully Professor Nanna was supportive, and beyond quickly checking in with her, the Healing class generally became the time and place to find Nothus so we could go off and work on more of our clever new ideas on our own.

“Have you gotten shorter?” I asked, once we’d left the classroom and gotten around the corner.

“The last time you saw me the two of us were in a ghoul infested mine, huddled around the body of your newly resurrected friend, and that’s the first thing you have to say to me?” the huge woman asked, though she was amused rather than offended.

“Please, I’d like to get somewhere at least a little more private before I start bawling my eyes out and telling you just how thankful I am.”

“You don’t need to *tell* me anything Quinn,” she said gently, “I know.”

“Well, good,” I said firmly, “I’m awful at talking about my feelings anyways. Now, don’t think you can distract me, why the drop in height? Thinking back, I’m pretty sure you’d already lost a couple inches last time I saw you, but I was a little too preoccupied at the time to really take notice.”

“I’m sure you’ve noticed, but being so large makes it hard to move about. Most of the ceilings are tall enough, but I constantly find myself ducking under doorways and the odd beam,” she explained, “So I’m rearranging myself to be a little more compact. It’s actually something I’ve wanted to ask you about for a while now.”

“Oh?”

“I was wondering if you’d let me do a full scan of your body, not just your arms. Humans have a whole different set of strengths and weakness than elves, and I think that if I combine qualities from the two, then I should be left with something stronger than either one alone.”

“So, you’d like to add my biological distinctiveness to your own?” I asked, holding back a laugh.

“Yes? Why do you find this so amusing?” she asked, “I was expecting suspicion, not mirth.”

I shrugged, “I owe you a whole lot Nothus. My hands would still be crippled if not for you, and Minki would be dead. Maybe most Elardians you might ask would be naturally suspicious of such a request, like you’re trying to steal their soul or something, but I don’t see it as any different from an MRI. And, I owe you.”

She nodded her large, bullet like head, “Thank you Quinn, I still don’t understand why it’s quite so funny though.”

“Don’t understand?” I laughed, “I figured that the empath would have plenty of experience understanding people’s emotions.”

“I do have plenty of experience,” she insisted, “You can just be a little incomprehensible sometimes. Andrew seems more or less like most elves, you’re just a little different. Not that it’s a bad thing Quinn, I’ve told you before how you’re easier to relax around.”

We walked a bit further, heading for our usual lunch spot, before Nothus spoke again, “You’re not particularly fond of Andrew.”

“No, not really.”

“I wish you weren’t so hostile towards him,” she said, “You don’t think about him often, but when you do the sudden change is like getting slapped in the face. Your emotions grow caustic, and it makes you hard to be around until you calm down. And I know that you’re the reason Andrew left Diova’s club, even if Andrew thinks that the whole thing was his own idea. Diova’s a royal, and will always be a royal, but at least he was better for Andrew than the people at the Order of the Claves are.”

“I don’t know what to tell you Nothus,” I sighed, “You’ve said before that Andrew treats you decently, unlike many people, but my experiences with him growing up were anything but pleasant. I was a quiet kid who didn’t get out much, and who didn’t make many friends. That meant that most of the people I spent time with, when I spent time with anyone, were family. So it was me, Andrew, and all of his brothers. To say that we had some rather different tastes is an understatement, and it resulted in a great deal of friction. It rarely got physical, and as far as my Uncle was concerned it was all ‘boys being boys’, but I know that I hated it. So, I get to Eldardia,” I continued, “Half kill myself to get to the University, and what do I find? Andrew and his family. Of all the people from Earth, here’s Andrew, again. And the first time I go to see them, to reconnect with my family, since that’s apparently supposed to be important, Uncle Walsh tries to ship me off to some military camp to work as some asshole noble’s adjutant. And when I don’t cooperate, he goes after my bursary. Trust me Nothus, you’re not the first one to point out my hostility towards Andrew, but I don’t think I’m going to be able to just turn it off. Because after all that, the abuse when we were kids, and the attempt by his father to rearrange my life, *I’m* somehow at fault for not being nice enough to him? No, he did that. I honestly don’t really care if The Order of the Claves is a bad influence on Andrew, half of my weird anti-social psychoses are probably borne out of my treatment at the hands of him and his brothers when we were kids, and I sure as hell don’t want someone like him learning Magic Missile.”

I let out a long breath, “I’m sorry if that makes me a shitty person to be around sometimes.”

“And it has nothing to do with Andrew being more talented at magic than you?” she asked, and I wasn’t until I looked up and saw her expression, that I realized she was fucking with me.

“Oh shut up!” I said, thumping her in the shoulder with one closed fist.

“It’s fine Quinn,” she said gently, “You were supportive of my venting before, and I can deal with a few hiccups. Besides, I don’t want you to feel like you’ve got to marshal your thoughts when you’re around me.”

“Thanks Nothus.”

# Chapter 62

**Quinn**

-----

We advanced slowly down the tunnel, the ruddy light of my spell gave the deep blue sea ice a purple hue, and made each breath from my soldiers look like a puff of red mist. I took the lead, pushing my force shield ahead of us as we descended slowly. I’d decided against tying off at the entrance and trailing a line down on the grounds that I didn’t want to get tangled up while fighting the ghouls, and had settled instead on crampons to keep us from slipping on the slick ice.

The first wave of ghouls, perhaps a dozen, showed themselves not long after we entered the tunnel. They came pelting up the icy slope, and I paid them barely any mind as I reached into my pouch and cast Symbol Drawing.

----

ᛣ

----

*Hmm, Death. Wait, shit, have I got this upside down?*

I felt an odd twinge of pain, and a sort of pressure in my head, and I lost my grip on the symbol as I steadied myself with my staff. The small tungsten token went tumbling and then bounced when it hit the tunnel floor, before sliding down the tunnel and out of sight. I heard the rapid *zap-zap-zap* of the Solar Pulse Rifles firing, and by the time I’d looked up, the ghouls had already been cut down.

“Well done,” I said calmly, “Call out if any of you run below a twenty five percent charge.”

“Yes sir,” came the sergeant’s reply from just behind me, and I felt the pressure redouble as I continued down the tunnel.

*That voice sounds familiar…*

The tunnel levelled out just before we reached the cavern at the centre of the iceberg, and I fixed the shield in place at the mouth of the tunnel. My soldiers stepped up, taking cover behind the shield and lashing the interior of the cavern with bolts of sunlight. What ghouls there were fell quickly, and the cavern quickly started to fill with steam as those shots that missed their mark impacted the deep blue ice of the walls and floor.

“Sergeant?”

“Yes sir,” he nodded, before raising his voice to bark out the orders, “Two on each tunnel, call for assistance if it’s more than you can handle.”

In the centre of the room, stretching from floor to ceiling, was a pillar of crystal clear ice. It might have been mistaken for glass, and embedded in the centre was a long black staff.

*I’ll take my staff, and bury it certain fathoms in this giant fucking iceberg.*

I pointed my own staff at the pillar, and it exploded into slushy fragments. I tore the black staff free of the rubble, and dropped it into one of the pouches on my belt. I could take the time to analyze the enchantments later, for now I needed to find where the symbol had gone, and then make a quick exit.

I heard the metallic creak of a valve opening, a hiss of pressurized liquid, and then a *whoomph* of ignition as one of the soldiers emptied the tank on their under barrel flamethrower and I glanced up to see a horde of ghouls burst into flame.

I ignored the ghouls, my soldiers seemed to be handling them just fine, and instead I turned my attention back to the cavern floor. I swept my light back and forth, trying to spot the little tungsten token, but it was rather difficult with all the rubble from the pillar strewn across the floor.

*Whoops.*

I caught the glint of metal eventually and kicked the chunks of ice out of the way to reveal the small token.

-----

ᛊ

-----

*Body, what? That’s not the token I dropped.*

I picked it up, and the pressure on my head suddenly spiked, becoming almost unbearable. Only then noticed a slightly darker patch in the ice, as if something had been encased in it. I dropped the little token into my pouch, and then gave the dark patch a closer look. I swept the rest of the rubble away with a gesture from my staff, and knelt down. The ice here was far too opaque to see through, but there was definitely something there. I gestured with my free hand and, in a wide swath around the patch, raised the temperature of the ice to a little above zero. It quickly turned from solid to liquid, creating a shallow pool in the ice before me, and my ‘prize’ floated to the surface.

It was Victorina.

Her body was so badly mangled as to be almost unrecognizable, and if not for the silver hair I might not have even realized that what floated in the water before me was even an elf.

*Oh no Victorina, nononon- NO! OH YOU SCHEMING B-*

-----

The pressure on my head snapped off, and I came awake with a roar, “YOU!”

She scrambled backwards, half falling out of the bed as she got tangled up in the covers, “Quinn, calm down, it’s not what you think it is.”

“Not what I think it is?” I shouted, “You were fucking with my head, and you’ve been fucking with my head since the beginning!”

She leaned forwards, and reached out a hand to touch my face, “Quinn, please, I can explain.”

I slapped her hand away, “I trusted you,” I seethed, “Not even Chypia tried what you just did. Get out.”

“Quinn,” she said, in a warning tone.

“Get. Out,” I growled, “OUT!” I roared again, when she opened her mouth to speak.

She climbed out of the bed, and tried to keep herself covered with her hands as she rather stiffly picked up her discarded clothing. I watched silently as she did, still seething, still furious, until she finally vacated my room with a casting of Teleport.

I lay back in bed, and tried to calm down. My heart was hammering, and it was a conscious effort to unclench my jaw. I’d already had my suspicions, oh yes I’d been suspicious, but it was another thing altogether to have those suspicions confirmed. Now I needed to re-examine everything that had happened between the two of us since that first night we’d had together. How much of what I felt was actually *my* own feelings, and not feelings that had been planted there by Victorina screwing with my subconscious. I turned my head to the side, to where she’d been lying until just recently, and saw a few stray strands of silver hair scattering her pillow.

I threw the covers aside, and threw myself out of bed. I stepped through into the bathroom and splashed some cold water on my face, trying to do something to calm the fury at being so coolly manipulated. I went to lay back down, but stopped instead in the doorway, staring at the bed. It was illuminated briefly by a flash of light from outside, which was quickly followed by a peal of thunder loud and close enough to shake the windows. The doorframe creaked in my white knuckled grip, and I growled the incantation to the Clean spell. I cast it over and over, on every bit of furniture, every flat surface, and over every square centimetre of carpet. I cast it on the clothes that I’d let fall to the floor, on what I had in my Portable Hole, and on those remaining in my wardrobe, before I finally subsided.

I fell back into bed, and let out a long breath. With the anger gone, I just felt… sad. It wasn’t the first time I’d received an emotional kick in the gut, but it was by far the worst. There had been breakups before, if you can call it a breakup when the relationship didn’t even last to the end of the second week, and those had hurt a little. I’d been rejected a couple of times, and that had hurt a little worse. But up till now I’d always thought that the worst feeling was to have someone you were interested in pick someone else, to be found somehow lacking.

*Well, turns out betrayal is way shittier.*

I lay there, trying to get back to sleep, but couldn’t shake the twisting feeling in my gut. Even with my extensive decontamination, the room still reeked of Victorina, reminding me of her absence with every breath. I pushed the covers off again, and lurched my way to the window. I threw it open, letting the smell and sound of rain wash into the room. Everything more than a few inches from the end of my nose was an indistinct blur, but as I leaned against the windowsill, I could just barely make out the rough blob on the horizon that was the Library.

*Fuck it, why not?*

I’d dressed, gathered my things, and was about to open the door of the clubhouse to leave, when a thought occurred to me.

I stepped away from the door and kicked off my shoes, before quietly climbing the stairs to the second floor. I found Minki’s room, and with the utmost caution, pushed open the door. It was a little brighter in Minki’s room, and I saw that there was a gentle blue glow emanating from a small crystal sitting on her nightstand. She was wearing what must have been Brandy’s pink flannel pyjamas, though she’d needed to roll up the sleeves quite a bit, and she was sleeping on her side, hugging a small plush doll to her chest.

*Oh you are just the cutest thing ever.*

It cheered me up a little, and I allowed myself a small smile as I crossed the room silently and knelt down next to her bed.

“Minki?” I said softly, as I reached out and set a hand on her shoulder.

She stirred slightly, and after a moment her eyes fluttered open, “Quinn?” she muttered sleepily, “What are you doing here?”

“I’ve got to leave Minki,” I whispered, and this got her attention, she perked up immediately, blinking the sleep from her eyes, “Not for good,” I assured her, “Just a couple of days, I should be back Feastday morning. If the others ask about me, can you tell them that?”

She nodded, “What about Victorina, can’t you tell her?”

I grimaced, and Minki seemed to understand, at least a little.

“It’s okay Quinn, I’ll tell them,” she promised, “But where are you going?”

“Best if I don’t explain for now,” I said softly, “But I’m going to need your help with something big when I get back.”

“Why me?” she whispered.

“I need someone I can trust,” I said simply.

Her big expressive grey eyes took on a sympathetic cast, “Oh, I’m so sorry Quinn.”

I sighed, “It’s alright.”

She sat up, her doll still clutched to her chest with one arm, and slipped the other arm around me in a quick hug.

“You’re staying with the club, right?” she asked hopefully.

“Yeah, I think so,” I nodded, “I guess we’ll see when I get back.”

“Good luck,” she said, “With whatever it is you’re going to do. Be safe.”

“I will,” I promised, “I’ll see you in a few days.”

-----

The rain was coming down hard as I ducked out through the window, and onto the roof. I was wearing my Earth clothes again, along with a leather backpack and leather climbing harness. Once I stepped into the antimagic field I wouldn’t be able to access the contents of my belt pouches, so I’d packed everything I’d need for the next couple days into the backpack. I would have preferred my original hiking backpack from Earth, but it was long gone, and I’d need to make do.

Dangling from the harness were two long loops of silken rope, which I threw over my shoulder before hauling myself up to stand on the first windowsill. Yes, it was raining, and yes, there might have been the occasional lightning strike, but on a scale of 1 to 10 I was at ‘fuck it’, so I didn’t really care. The rain would help mask my ascent and besides, between the balcony at the top and the direction of the wind, the side I was climbing was actually sheltered from the rain.

*It probably won’t kill me.*

I gripped the window bars tightly, and with my feet I braced myself on either side of the recessed window. Taking it slowly, one hand at a time, I pulled myself further up the window, before shimmying up with my feet. It wasn’t too much climbing, and in only a minute I’d managed to work my way up to the top of the first window. Carefully, very carefully, I took one hand off the bars and reached up to grasp the narrow overhang at the top of the window. It was a little damp, but thankfully wasn’t so wet as to be too slippery to hold on to. Then, and this was the tricky part, I let go of the bars with the other hand. Very quickly I snapped that hand up to join the other on the ledge.

I was very conscious of the fact that I hadn’t yet tied off, mainly because it wouldn’t have done any good. Aside from the bars, I didn’t have anything to tie the ropes to, and tying off on the first floor window was a little futile, since the knot would just be dragged down to the bottom of the window. At least a fall from this height wouldn’t kill me.

*Probably just some light maiming.*

I hauled myself up in the world’s most awkward chin-up, and while I had to let my legs hang free, it let me grab hold of the next ledge, the one at the bottom of the next window. I kicked blindly with my legs, trying to get a toe hold on the previous ledge, and almost lost my grip before I could manage it. I did manage it though, and it left me in a rather awkward half crouch on the side of the tower.

*I hope no one can see me, because not only will I get expelled, but I also because I’m sure that I look like an idiot right now.*

I straightened carefully, keeping one hand on the ledge while I reached up with the other to take hold of the next set of window bars. Now I could finally apply some proper leverage without the worry of slipping off, and I was able to pull myself up far enough to stand on the windowsill of the second window. I looped one elbow through the bars, and undid the knot on one of the two ropes I’d tied to my climbing harness earlier. Then I slipped one end of the rope through the bars, and retied it. I did the same with the other rope, and just like that, I’d reduced the risk I was taking from death to a permanently crippling injury.

*Well, sort of permanent.*

I’d be able to heal myself, assuming I could descend the rest of the way safely and then crawl my way out of the antimagic field.

Just as with the first window, I managed to pull myself up with my hands while I braced myself with my feet, before finally reaching up to take hold of the ledge at the top of the window. I’m by no means a beefy guy, I’m actually pretty thin, but that was by no means a hindrance as I climbed that stupid tower. As light as I was, it wasn’t too much work to pull myself up to each successive ledge and I managed to get to the third window without falling or having a heart attack. Once there I looped my elbow through the bars again, and undid the knot on one of the two loops of rope. I pulled at it until it was free of the bars on the second floor window, and then looped it around the bars of the third floor before retying it. So secured, I did the same with the other loop before continuing my climb towards the top of the tower.

That was the worst part of the whole experience, getting from one window to the other. Once I had a good grip on the bars I was in good shape, I could stand there on the windowsill with an elbow looped through the bars and take a break, and once I needed to start climbing again the bars made it much easier. Sure, they were vertical rather than horizontal bars, but there’s still something reassuring about being able to get my hand all the way around the handhold, instead of dangling essentially by my fingers, as I needed to when trying to pull myself up onto the ledge at the top and bottom of each window.

Actually, that’s not true, getting from one window to the other was the *second* worst part of the whole experience. The *worst* part was getting up onto the balcony.

*This is going to suck.*

I peered up at the underside of the balcony, holding tightly to the window on the sixth floor. It had taken the better part of two hours to get as high as I had, but it was starting to look like the next fifteen minutes would be the most difficult. There was a solid looking support beam holding up the balcony, but I didn’t really want to put myself in the precarious position of trying to stretch backwards to grab on to it, while also trying to hold on to the ledge. If worst came to worst and I fell the rope would catch me, but the process of it catching me was going to be *very* unpleasant.

Rather than rush on blindly, I took a moment to think. I reached backwards awkwardly with one hand and slipped it into my backpack, I pulled out some of the pemmican I’d wrapped up earlier, and snacked on that while I pondered my problem.

No longer quite so hungry, I pulled a large knife from my pack, and then untied one of my two anchor ropes. I tied the end of the rope around the hilt of the knife, and then swung the knife up in an arc. It took a couple of tries to get it to go through the gap between the support beam and the balcony, and I beat the hell out of the knife, but I got it through eventually. Rather than faff about trying to climb up the wall, I just hauled myself up the rope until I could reach the beam. I got my arms around the beam, and swung my legs up, crossing my ankles on top of the beam. I was *extremely* conscious of just how high up I was, but I was also very close to my goal.

I shimmied as far as I could along the beam, before reaching up blindly with one hand to try to find something to hold on to so I could pull myself up. I didn’t have much luck. The guardrail that had originally ringed the balcony was long gone, and whatever remnants there were of the railing weren’t going to be of much use. And aside from that the rain, while it had masked my ascent, had soaked the balcony and made it slippery as hell. The balcony creaked loudly as I shifted around on the beam trying to find a handhold, and I froze. The balcony wasn’t quite as old as the Library itself, and they’d clearly had workers up here to replace or maintain the balcony at some point, but if the absence of the railing and general state of the balcony in general was any indication that hadn’t been for some time. The boards weren’t quite rotted through, but they were starting to get that soft and overly flexible feeling of wood that was *really* past its usable shelf life.

*Well, maybe I can work with that.*

I kicked experimentally at the bottom of one of the boards that formed the deck of the balcony, and it jumped up slightly. I kicked it again, harder this time, and it came free. It only took a couple more kicks to knock a couple more boards out, opening a hole large enough to squeeze through. I pulled myself up as gently as I could, conscious of the fact that the boards were obviously quite weak, and just like that, I was on top of the tower.

I flopped out on my back, exhausted from my climb, and glad that I was finally on something that resembled solid ground. I let the rain fall, spattering my glasses, and I just lay there for a couple minutes while I regained my breath.

*Fucking hell, let’s never do that ever again.*

I sat up and checked the state of the boards that I’d kicked free to make my opening. Thankfully they were still whole, all I’d done was kick the nails loose. I’d be able to put them back into place once I was sure that I’d be able to get through the balcony door and into the tower proper.

The first thing I tried was the chain holding the doors shut, and while there was some slack, enough to let me open the doors a couple of centimetres, the chain was made of the same super-bronze as the window bars. I wasn’t going to be able to file through it. The lock too wasn’t really an option, since it was on the inside of the doors and I couldn’t open them far enough to slip a hand through, otherwise I would have given picking the lock a shot. I’d experimented with locksport back on Earth and had never been very good at it, but then, medieval locks weren’t known for their complexity. I was pretty sure that if I’d been able to get my hands on it, I could have opened it.

*The windows then.*

If worst came to worst I could simply smash one of the windows, they were just regular glass after all, but that would leave evidence of my passing. The less evidence I left the less likely I was to be caught, and the longer I’d be able to spend in the tower before I was forced to return to the clubhouse.

The frames, like the chain and like all the other metal in this tower, seemed to be super-bronze. *Orichalcum I think?* Orichalcum was stronger than steel, but it wasn’t perfect, because as far as I could tell it was still just as flexible as bronze. That wasn’t actually a terrible thing, not for weapons, and not for armour, but it did mean that I had a fair chance of… *perfect.*

With the file on my multitool I managed to pry one of the panes of glass out of its frame, and I had a moment of panic as the pane fell inwards. I just barely managed to snake a hand inside to catch it before it hit the tile floor inside, and I let out a relieved breath as I let it down gently.

I untied my two anchor ropes and pulled them up before stowing them in my pack and setting the boards back into their places. I had to stomp them back down to push the nails back through, but the balcony looked no worse for wear once I was done with it.

I pushed my pack through the hole the missing pane had made, and then hunched my shoulders and wiggled through after it. Replacing the pane wasn’t much trouble, and then there I was, in the Forbidden Tower, with no one the wiser.

*I really hope it’s all sorted properly.*

It wasn’t.



# Chapter 63

**Quinn**

-----

The top floor of the Forbidden Tower looked more or less like the top floor of all the other towers I’d explored. No interior walls, a few pillars helping to support the conical roof, and a whole lot of dust. Once, several hundred years ago at this point, it had been the quarters for one of the University’s senior professors. Now it was cold and empty, the room having been stripped right down to the floorboards.

I crept to the staircase in the centre of the room, and peered down into the darkness of the lower levels. It wasn’t quite pitch black, some light from the city filtered through the large windows, but it was awfully close. I patted the side of my pack, checking to see that my Maglite was still there, before descending cautiously. I wasn’t quite sure how often they maintained this part of the Library, since it was blocked off most of the time, and I didn’t really want to fall through a weakened spot in the stairs.

The old spiral stairs let out a series of deafening creaks as I made my way down to the next level, but at least I didn’t fall through or break anything. It was a little creepy, being in the Library in the middle of the night. The shelves were placed very close together, and for all my looking I couldn’t find a whole lot of empty places. What this meant was that it was a little creepy and claustrophobic once I was down here among the shelves, and that whatever light had been coming through the windows was blocked out by several wall-like bookcases.

*Sorting through this all is going to take ages.*

I checked my watch, and the faintly glowing hands showed me that it was 3:35am. It was damn early, but not so early that I couldn’t afford to get started now. In theory, I had three days. Fextday, which was today, Satyrday, and Feastday. I’d probably want to leave earlier in the evening on Feastday, but that lost time was more than made up for by my early arrival today. The reality though was a bit different. My phone’s battery would only last so long, and once it died I wasn’t going to be able to copy any more of the books. I’d charged it fully and then shut it off right before stepping out onto the roof, and when it came back on it would be in power saving mode, but it would run dry eventually. The Maglite was also battery powered, and would also run out eventually, but I wasn’t really worried about it. It had been running on the same three D cells since I’d first landed in Elardia, and wasn’t about to run out of power any time soon.

*Five floors, forty eight waking hours… Call it fifty, which gives me ten hours per floor.*

I didn’t get to it right away though, I wanted to get a good look at this place first. I needed to find a comfortable place to sleep for the two nights I’d spend here, and I wanted to make sure that there were no surprises waiting for me on the lower levels. I was also holding out hope that at least some of this mess would be organized, though the more I walked between the stacks, the more I was sure that I was out of luck.

*There is no way that ten hours per floor is going to be enough, even if all I do is read titles. If ten hours per floor was enough, then the stupid Library would have been indexed properly by now.*

The towers weren’t too big, but they were big enough, and the bookshelves were placed very tightly together. The bookshelves themselves were huge, and even I’d need a ladder to get at the top couple of shelves. Combine that with the fact that most of the bookshelves had books shelved two layers deep, and I was going to have a hell of a time finding what I’d need.

I’d originally envisioned the plan in three stages. The first stage was just to find the original copy of the stasis spell used by the Ariros guild nearly a thousand years ago, and then to scan the thing with my phone. The second stage was to track down the *other* spell I’d need for my plan to work, and scan that as well. With those two stages done I’d intended to spend the rest of my time, and the rest of the phone’s battery, scanning whatever texts seemed particularly interesting. It was starting to look as if stage one might take up all my time though.

*I don’t even know what the stupid book is called.*

I pulled my Maglite free of my backpack as I descended to the next floor, along with a scrap of red silk that I’d brought along for just this purpose. The red silk went over the front of the flashlight, and I tied it in place with a bit of cord. I’d still want to use it sparing, but at least this way I’d have some light to read by. I could also use the phone, but I didn’t want to turn that on until absolutely necessary.

On the third floor from the top I found the solution to a *huge* problem that I hadn’t yet realized would even be a problem in the first place. The solution in this case, was a bathroom.

*Oh. Yeah, kinda glad this is here.*

I flicked on the flashlight as I pushed open the door, and scanned it around briefly before checking all the fixtures. Thankfully everything worked the way I expected it to, and while it was a little dusty in here, it was also clean.

Beyond the shelves and shelves of forbidden knowledge, there wasn’t really anything else of interest to be found on the other levels of the tower, and my exploration came to an end at the top of the stairs that lead down to the unrestricted section of the tower. There was a massive hatch that looked like it might have come off of the world’s largest submarine, and it covered the whole of the staircase down. It was bronze rather than steel, or at least it looked like bronze, I was pretty sure that it was the same orichalcum as the bars on the exterior windows.

*Well no one is opening that silently.*

At least I’d have some warning if someone else came poking around in here. This part of the tower also seemed to be frequented a little more often, and while most of the shelves still had quite a bit of dust on them the furniture did not. Chairs had been moved, belongings had been set down on some of the tables, and people had spent time working at some of the desks.

*Best to start down here then. I don’t want to get done with the top four floors, only to find that someone’s set up shop down here and isn’t going to leave for hours.*

It didn’t take me long to come up with a new strategy for searching the mess of books, though I had some doubts as to its effectiveness. I pulled out several books as I picked through the shelves and piled them on one of the tables. If it seemed time magic related, it went on the table. If it related to necromancy, it went on the table. Interesting subject? It went on the table. Of course I’d thought that third criteria would quickly lead to every book in the Library ending up on that table, but the most of the books I trawled through were surprisingly boring, or were duplicates of existing works. There were two whole shelves dedicated entirely to storing a couple hundred copies of a spell that was designed specifically for long term torture of a captive.

*Boring, but at least it cuts down on what I need to search.*

There were books on convoluted and painful ways to kill people that made Acid Jet look positively tame. There were spells to tear free internal organs, to cause virulent diseases, and to make someone rot from the inside. And every one of them was *boring,* the last thing I needed was new ways to kill people. I could come up with plenty of awful ideas on my own. There were spells for demon and spirit summoning, and while they were much less boring, using them seemed like a really terrible idea, so they stayed right where they were.

There was a permanent version of the memory suppression spell that Nothus used on Minki, and I decided that it was interesting enough to keep. It could end up saving my ass in the right situation, and it could hopefully be used to heal psychological trauma in much the way that Nothus had done for Minki.

I didn’t find any other necromantic spells beyond the ones on spirit summoning, but I did find a spell called ‘Slow Time’. It wasn’t quite the stasis spell I needed, and only slowed time to a tenth or so of its regular speed when fully powered, but it might prove useful.

*Food preservation, extending the time I’ve got to resuscitate someone, or if I really need to I can try to use it as a reference to rebuild the version that the Ariros guild used.*

The time just flew past, and I barely noticed when the sun had come up. Even by noon, with the light of the sun streaming through the windows it was still rather murky inside the tower itself. The shelves served to screen the light, and if I hadn’t had my watch with me I might not have even been able to keep track of what time of day it was. I’d been staying away from the windows so it wasn’t as if I’d be able to go take a look at the sun’s position, and the level of murk further within the tower didn’t vary much between noon and morning. I was nearing my ten hour time limit though, and it was about time I had something to eat anyway.

I’d skipped breakfast in the interest of further research, and judging from the noises coming from my belly I was mere minutes from starvation. I pulled out my phone as I ate, turning it on and checking that it was indeed in power saving mode. Between that and lowering the screen resolution to 720p I’d apparently have twenty four hours of battery life. I expected that to drop once I started scanning books and the phone was working through the characters, but even half that would be more than enough to cover my needs.

I read a little from each of the books as the phone crunched through the character recognition, trying to get an idea of just what information I was making off with. There were some interesting details about how Slow Time worked for example, but I quickly realized that each of these spells were pretty far beyond what I was currently able to do. To be able to cast Permanent Forgetfulness for example, I’d need to know over a dozen other spells just to form the foundational understandings of this one, and I’d need to know them well.

*Might take a while to learn the stasis spell then, damn.*

At least the spells weren’t going anywhere. With the enchantments I’d placed on the phone it was damn near indestructible, and I’d be able to keep it charged indefinitely with magic. I could afford to be patient, and it was not as if these books were going to take up much memory on the phone.

I tried to put the books back roughly where I’d originally found them, but didn’t pay that much attention to proper placement. This place was disorganized enough that no one was going to notice that the abject chaos they walked in on was slightly different from the abject chaos they’d left weeks or months ago when they’d been here last. I got the last of the books put away around two o’clock, and headed up the stairs to start on the next chaotic mess that these people called a library.

-----

It wasn’t until the following day, after I’d spent a night hanging between two sturdy looking bookshelves in my hammock, that I started to come across some of what I’d been looking for. I was still on the second floor, having split the ten hour allotment between two days, when I found some proper Necromancy spells. There were a dozen or so books, all of which were bound in black leather, that judging from the writing style had all been authored by the same Mage. The author hadn’t signed their name, but the titles spoke for themselves. There were several volumes labeled ‘The Creation, Control, & Destruction of Undead’, along with ‘The Qualities of Bloodstone’ and ‘The Construction of Phylacteries for Personal & Extrapersonal Use’. A phylactery wasn’t quite what I needed to lift the curse, but it was getting awfully close. Between that and the words “Destruction of Undead” I added the whole set to my pile.

I stopped for breakfast just as the sun was coming up, and took advantage of the better light to scan in the books I’d found. There wasn’t a whole lot more of interest to me beyond the Necromancy collection I’d found early that morning, though there was a great deal more of the spirit summoning nonsense which I gave a wide berth.

That was the trouble with the collection in the Forbidden Tower, there are only so many rules to break, even if there were an infinite number of ways to break those few rules. It meant that if all you could spare for each book was a passing glance, then you would understandably come to the conclusion that much of what was found here were variations on only a couple of themes. I knew that I’d discover much more if I was given the chance to sit down with a single book, but I didn’t have the time to sit down and ponder all of the consequences of any given spell.

*Explains why the tower is so full though. Without any public reference material on something like mind control, every Mage that’s wanted to try it has had to discover how to do it on their own. And then when they’re found out, the spell gets put on the pile with the other hundred nearly identical ones.*

-----

By the time I started exploring the third floor I began to realize that there was at least some mild organization going on. The first floor had been various miscellanea that didn’t really fit on any other floor, along with books that had been taken from upper levels and then shelved back on the first due to laziness. The second was mostly necromancy and spirit summoning, and the third… the third level was the mind control magic.

I almost skipped it, almost.

I still felt sick when I thought of what Victorina had done, and that had been accomplished with spells that were more or less acceptable to use. And the contents of this floor though were light years beyond any of that, for fucks sake, one of the books I found was titled ‘The Construction of a Personal Harem Through The Use of Mind Control Magic’. I felt a building rage at the thought of anyone using such magic against myself or my friends, and the thought of even touching such a product of a twisted mind was revolting. Learning it, taking that knowledge within myself… There was a small part of my mind that disagreed though, and while it was small, it spoke the loudest, and it said “Be prepared.”

The mind control spells, especially the ones that allowed for fucking body snatching, were revolting, but I needed to be able to defend myself against them. To reverse the body snatching spells I needed to know them, and to dispel the others would be nearly impossible without the same knowledge.

So they went on the pile.

It was a sort of triage, picking not just the spells I needed to be able to defend against, but also the specific version of the spell to learn. I erred on the side of better writing, assuming that any text that looked like the ravings of a madman was probably not worth the trouble.

*And it’ll fuck with the OCR.*

There was one spell though that looked useful, and not just as a reference for counter-magic, but also in the enforcement of law. The spell, spells actually since there were two, were Lesser and Greater Geas. The spells were essentially a command to the subject, that they had to follow, though their will was not subsumed and they’d be able to decide how the command was carried out. The main difference between the two spells was in how achievable the given command had to be. From the testing done by the author, Lesser Geas would generally fail if the command was too unreasonable, though tasks taking as much as a decade were apparently within the realm of possibility. Greater Geas on the other hand could be damn well anything, and could be worded in such a way as to consume the subject’s entire life.

Did I want to create some Orwellian state where everyone was commanded to be a ‘Model Citizen’? Hell no. But it made quite the punishment. If I did succeed, and did lift the curse, I was going to need to spend some time thinking about what to do with the criminals within my territory. Long prison terms or rehabilitation centres as they were used on Earth in the western world weren’t really possible on Elardia. The resources to imprison someone for decades, let alone an entire elf life, just didn’t exist. Rehabilitation was similarly impossible, mostly since I wasn’t going to be able to advance the state of psychology by dozens of centuries in anything other than a *very* long time. Or at least rehabilitation as *I* knew it, or as the swedes did it, was impossible. Magic provided some interesting alternatives though. Rather than hang or maim serious criminals, as was the custom in most cases in Elardia, I could use one of the two Geas spells.

*I’m not terribly fond of the death penalty, and this might be the solution. Murder or rape? Well guess what, you’re spending the rest of your days as a pacifist who’s dedicated their life to helping the sick and the needy. Greater Geas where other rulers might hang, Lesser Geas where they might maim.*

-----

I had *just* put the last of the mind control texts away, and was considering whether to turn in early, when I heard the four most terrifying words in the English language.

“There you are Quinn!”



# Chapter 64

**Quinn**

-----

*For the love of…*

I turned to face the man who had greeted my so cheerily, to find…

“Baron Bronippo,” I said levelly.

There he was, standing there in his orange robes, and smiling slightly. He didn’t quite have me backed into a corner, but he was between me and the stairs, blocking one end of the narrow corridor between two large bookshelves. He couldn’t have been much past five feet tall, and if he’d been a human I’d be confident in my ability to overpower him, if it came to that. With an elf’s greater strength though, I was much less certain.

*Play it cool, you belong here, you have permission to be here. Any suggestion otherwise would be preposterous and insulting.*

“Quinn,” he nodded, “Enjoy your climb?”

*Ah shit.*

“Here to blackmail me?” I asked. I wasn’t usually one to skip the foreplay, it was often the most enjoyable part of the exchange, but I needed to resolve this as quickly as possible.

“Quinn,” he said in a hurt tone, one hand to his chest, “Please, I’d never do such a thing, we’re friends.”

*Friends. Right.*

I gave him a wry look, “Just came by to say hello then?”

“To offer our assistance,” he corrected, “It can’t be easy going it alone.”

“Our?” I asked, craning my ears to listen for anyone else that might be creeping around.

*But you didn’t hear that big stupid door now did you Quinn?*

“You know who my liege is, I’m here to offer help on his behalf.”

“Help with what exactly? Finding the right book?” I asked, gesturing at the mess we were standing in, “I don’t think I need Diova’s help for that. Pretty sure I’ve got it covered.”

“No,” he said, “The other thing.”

*Other… Oh.*

“Fuck,” I swore, “The clubhouse is bugged, isn’t it?”

“Bugged?” he asked, “I assume that’s some sort of reference to surveillance? Well, yes, that is the case.”

“Well. I suppose it’s a good thing I’ve kept most of the details to myself then.”

“Especially considering your recent falling out with Victorina,” he agreed.

I was not particularly fond of the idea of Diova or his flunkies watching Victorina and I in bed, and there was a brief moment where I considered lunging at him, grabbing him by the scruff of the neck, before slamming him into one of the bookshelves. I managed to keep myself under control though. He might not yet know that elves are so much stronger than humans. It was possible that as far as he knew, he was facing down someone a great deal bigger than him, in a situation where no amount of magic was going to help.

*Besides, no proper imperial goes about smacking people around, they get someone else to do it for them.*

“I would suggest being a great deal more respectful,” I said, anger creeping into my voice.

Unfortunately he didn’t cower in fright, but I did see him straighten his back and square his shoulders a little. Only a little though, whatever he was feeling, he wasn’t about to show it.

“Perhaps I might be able to make amends for my comments,” he said graciously, “We could of course provide some assistance in your attempt to contend with the wraith.”

“And just what form would this assistance take?”

“Manpower,” he explained, “Even if some of your clubmates wanted to help you, and weren’t held back from doing so by Victorina, I can’t see whatever assistance they can render as being sufficient to the task. You will need *someone’s* help.”

“And I should accept yours? Hell, why are you even up here Bronippo?” I asked, omitting his title, “How did you even get in here?”

“Would you believe I asked nicely?” he asked.

My only reply was a raised eyebrow.

“Very nicely,” he clarified, “And you know why I’m here Quinn.”

“Scrying magic,” I sighed, “And this tower is one of the only places that is certain to be secure.”

He nodded, “We were working on an alternative, but once we saw you leave, and it was reported that you were climbing the tower…” he trailed off, one hand lifted.

“Fine. Thanks for talking to me Baron, the answer is no.”

“Oh?”

“I don’t require your assistance to lift the curse,” *And I’m not letting you get your hooks into me.*

“Ah, but that’s not all we have to give,” he said.

“Give?”

“Well, offer.”

“What else then?” I asked.

“You’re a smart man Quinn-” he started.

“I know.”

“Well then you also know that the moment the guild is claimed, the hourglass begins to empty. King Nezzabi will not allow Azarburg to slip from his fingers. You’ll find yourself in conflict with Duke Leucia, and all the support that the King can provide him without agitating the rest of the University.”

“So that’s what this is?” I asked, “You want to see Nezzabi get kicked in the teeth?”

He spread his hands, “That is putting it rather crudely, but it is the truth. The city cannot stand on its own, and you’ll need the resources to build whatever manner of Outsider weaponry you introduce to tip the balance. You must know that your uncle, and his *matchlocks,* will be foremost among the assistance that Nezzabi will provide.”

*Fuck, I was testing the rifle in the back garden, they’ve probably seen it. In how much detail though…*

“So, what,” I asked, “Your gift, Diova’s gift, whoever’s gift to me is going to be a big pile of bronze ingots? Maybe some lumber?”

“If that is what you require,” he said, “You must understand, it is not as if we could send actual soldiers to assist in the defence.”

“Yeah yeah, foreign power and all that,” I said dismissively, “I’m afraid that the answer is still no though.”

“Really?”

“Really.”

He shrugged, “That is unfortunate,” he mused, and I tensed to rush him if the next sentence he spoke contained the threat of blackmail, “Take this though, in case you change your mind, or come up with something else that you might require,” he said, holding out a silver ring in his outstretched palm.

“What is that?” I asked, looking down at the ring, but not reaching out for it.

“A Ring of Communication,” he explained, “You’d be able to contact us whenever the fancy took you. It is of course too risky to speak openly of this to Diova, but through this you might be able to make contact without being observed, and at significant distance.”

*A magic cellphone… To hell with all this other nonsense,* ***I*** *want a magic cellphone.*

“No.”

“No?” he asked, a little surprised this time.

“No. You want me to owe your boss a favour? You want me to give Nezzabi a hard time?” I asked, “Give me the enchantment for that ring, then we’ve got a deal.”

He raised an eyebrow, before reaching into his robes, “By all means,” he said, drawing out a rather slim tome.

*Ah fuck.*

“Is there a problem?” he asked, holding out the book to me.

I took it, flipping through the first few pages, “And you just… carry this book around all the time?”

“Good night Quinn,” he said, holding up the ring again in offer.

I shook my head, still examining the book, “Good night Baron.”

----

I sat down to read the book, just as Bronippo was leaving, but hopped up again as soon as he was down the stairs and out of sight. Then I dashed to the edge of the stairs and peered over the side. He’d probably spot me following him with those oversized eyes, but that didn’t mean that he was going to *hear* me. I followed him down, staying a floor back, keeping the stairs between us and making sure that I only stepped on the very outside edge of each step. In a building this old it would be hard to mask the creeks, but keeping away from the centre of each step where they were least supported would help, and hopefully elven hearing was such that he wouldn’t notice what sound was made.

I pressed myself flat to the carpet on the floor above the big loud door that wasn’t loud at all, and listened.

“So?” Came a low voice, though not one I could recognize, “Did he go for it?”

There was a pause, *Bronippo shaking his head?* “He took the book, but not the ring, and wasn’t at all interested in the men or the supplies.”

“Damn,” came the quiet reply “Well he took something at least.”

I *did* hear the door open, but it was not the squealing and screeching that I’d expected, and a moment later it thumped closed.

*Of course they fucking oil it Quinn, it’s a damned library. Maybe don’t get so complacent next time.*

**Minki**

“I can’t believe you did that Vicky. That was like, way uncool!” Brandy said, stomping her foot.


“I don’t understand why you and Quinn are both so hung up on this,” Victorina sighed, “I can understand why Quinn might not be pleased with me, but his reaction seems excessive.”


“Not pleased? You were like, mind controlling him. That is *super* not nice.”


“It was not-“ Victorina started.


“It totes is!” Brandy interrupted, “How would you like it if some slimy dude was creeping on one of us, and was like, doing the exact thing you were doing to Quinn?”


“I have to agree with Brandy here,” Neferoy added, “What did you even hope to achieve?”


Victorina put her face in her hands, and when she spoke her voice was slightly muffled, “I wanted to know that I could trust him.”


“What, by making sure he can’t trust you?” Brandy demanded.


“No, that was the point, to *make* him trust me,” Victorina said, lifting her face from her hands and slumping back on the sofa.


“He *already* trusted you,” Neferoy said sadly.


*Oh Vicky…*


“You don’t know that for sure,” Vicky challenged.


Neferoy glanced at Halea, who had been sitting quietly by the fire, and gave her a questioning look.


“I’ve done a lot of sparring with him Vicky, I know just how sturdy his mental defences are,” Halea grimaced, “If you were casting on him night after night, and were getting through night after night, then it’s only because he *let* you in. I shouldn’t need to tell you what that means.”


“You should super-duper apologize,” Brandy added, “it was really mean what you did to him,”


“I thought you didn’t even like Quinn,” Victorina snapped, “I believe you were quite adamant about your dislike for him.”


“That was all- whatever,” Brandy said, interrupting herself, “It doesn’t mean you can just be all mind controlly.”


“We need him Vicky,” Halea said, “And more than that, Quinn’s a part of the team now. Brandy’s right, you should apologize. Maybe you two won’t get back together, but hopefully he’ll stick around.”


“Fine,” Victorina grumbled, “Does anyone even know where he is? I haven’t seen him since he threw his big tantrum.”


“Victorina,” I chided.


Victorina sighed, “You’re right, I’m sorry.”


“I’m not the one you need to apologize to,” I said quietly, “And Quinn will be back in a day or two, Louday at the latest.”


“You know that for sure?” Halea asked.


I nodded, and felt my cheeks turn a little pink, “He came to see me before he left. He didn’t tell me where he was going, but promised that he would be back.”


“Oh sard,” Victorina breathed.


“What is it?” I asked.


“I think I know where he is,” she said, running her hands through her hair, “I just hope he’s not digging into something that’s going to get him into too much trouble.”

**Quinn**

*Rend soul? Perfect!*

**Minki**

“Hey there Minki-mouse,” Brandy said melancholically, as I stepped out to join her on the balcony.


“Hey Brandy, I just wanted to thank you for standing up for Quinn,” I said quietly, “Some of the others might have been a little on the fence about the whole thing, but once they knew that even you thought she’d gone too far… Um, not that-”


“It’s alright,” she said, “I haven’t really been very nice to him.”


“Um, why don’t you like him?”


“I’m probably just like, jealous, or whatever. It’s like, he’s just super good at everything, and super hot chicks give him attention for nerdy things like math, and nothing I do even matters. And when I do know about stuff that matters, I don’t even like, know that it’s even important.”


“What do you mean?” I asked, looking *way* up to see her slightly sad expression.


“Like the math stuff he showed us when he first got here, or the numbers and stuff. Quinn is a giant nerd, and I’m used to nerds being like, turbo virgins who never ever talk to girls. But then he starts telling you guys all about math or whatever, and you’re all over him asking questions and stuff because math is all important or whatever. But…” she let out a breath, “When I first got here and I found out you guys didn’t do all that algebra stuff and just had romany numbers, I thought it was all great and stuff because I’d never need to think about complicated math things again. I didn’t even know it was important,” she said, almost on the point of tears, “I’m just useless here.”


“That’s not true,” I said, doing my best to reassure her, “You’ve got to know lots of things, you’d pick it up just by living in a world as advanced as yours. We just need to go over what you know and work out what it is we can actually use.”


She shook her head, “And good ideas I’ll ever have, Quinn’s probably already thought of. There’s no point. My whole job is just to sit around all day and give Victorina my bursary. It’s just, like, arghh,” she said, pulling at her hair.


“What is it?” I asked, trying to prod her into continuing her thought.


“Do you know what a model is?” She asked, and I shook my head, “It’s like, a person who shows off clothes or whatever, a model *models* the clothes. Sometimes other stuff, but lots of the time it’s clothes. It's what I wanted to do for ever and ever, and my mom had a connection and stuff, and got me into modeling right after high school. It didn’t matter what grades I got, or how smart I was, I just needed to be super pretty.”


She was silent for a long moment, as she rubbed at her face with her hands, and when she started speaking again it was in a much quieter voice, “I’m doing the exact same thing now, as I was back on Earth. I sit around and do nothing, I live all luxuriously and stuff, and have all the best things. But when I was back home I always felt like I’d deserved it. There was like, so many other girls that wanted to be models, but they didn’t get it. But here in Elardia I realize just how totally useless I am. I didn’t get paid a bunch of money to fly to Paris for some fashion show because I was the prettiest girl ever, I got to do it because my Dad knew a guy. I’m not here in this club because I’m the best Mage Victorina could find, I’m here because I got lucky. I got lucky when I was born with all that talent stuff, and lucky again when Victorina was the one to find me. If Victorina hadn’t found me, or if I hadn’t been as talented, then I would have been fucked. Probably literally. People are all looking for ‘Outsider knowledge’ and stuff, but what do I know. I would have ended up as a toy for some noble guy if I hadn’t been so lucky. ‘Go sit over there and look pretty Brandy, it’s all you’re good for’,” she said, as the tears started to flow.


I wrapped my arms around her hips, and she was so much taller that I was only eyelevel with her stomach, “That’s not true,” I said firmly.


“But it is true,” she insisted, “What happens when Victorina finds some other way of paying for all this stuff?” she asked, waving a hand towards the wall of the clubhouse, “Or when my teachers finally realize that even if some rock said I’ve got lots of talent, that I can’t like, even really pay attention long enough to learn anything. Victorina’s not going to put up with dead weight. I’ll be out on my ass, and it won’t matter how cute or pert it is, not when anyone can look as pretty as they want to just by drinking some potion.”


“Just- Just stoppit you,” I said sharply, and I think I surprised both of us with just how assertive I was, “No more whining and ‘woe is me’ nonsense. Venting is one thing, but now you’re just beating yourself up for no reason. What do you *want*?”


“What?” she asked dumbly.


“What do you want, from Earth?” I asked, “What thing did you have back home, that you can’t have now? Because we’re going to make that thing, and maybe then you’ll realize that you’re not so useless.”


“How would I… I don’t even know-” she started.


“No!” I said, smacking her on the side, “The *thing* first, we can worry about *how* later.”


“I wish I had some of my Earth clothes,” she mused, “Quinn’s still got his jeans… Oh!”


“Yes?” I prompted.


“Jeans, denim! We can get indigo already, and once we find some cotton we’re going to make the hottest skinny jeans ever!” she said, pumping one fist in the air.


“Skinny jeans!” I cheered.

**Quinn**


---


The floor immediately following the one full of mind control books had been primarily focused on doing Bad Things to a person’s body, and while it had been where I’d found Rend Soul, it hadn’t been much of a treasure trove otherwise.


There had been some nonsense about chimerization, along with a great deal of other material on elven transmutation, but I’d passed on all of that. It was great if you really wanted to fuck with someone without killing them, *I’ll turn you into a newt, etc, etc,* or if you wanted to create some particularly tough minions, but I didn’t find either of those ideas particularly appealing. If I had an enemy that I feared or hated enough to transmute into an animal, then it would be better just to kill them. Not only was it nearly the same morally, it was also more merciful, and more intelligent. Leaving a mortal enemy alive to seek revenge at some later date was not the best idea, and if they weren’t a mortal enemy, then they probably didn’t deserve to be transmuted or killed. As for the minions, while the idea of some shark-dino hybrid appealed to me, it did not seem like an effective way to actually get anything done.


----


Finally, after lunch on the third day, I got to the last floor in the tower.


*Of course it was the last floor.*


It took the rest of the day, and the sunlight was fading by the time I’d finally found it, but the important part was that I found it. No fancy title, and the cover wasn’t much to look at, just some rough and undyed leather, but there was the old Ariros crest, burnt into its surface.


Thankfully I’d been on the look out, specifically for this sort of book, otherwise I might have missed it entirely. Of course, it had meant digging through the diaries of at least a hundred different wizards, hoping that one of them would be the book that had the stasis spell tucked into it somewhere, but it paid off in the end.


*Between this and Rend Soul, I think I’ve got this finally. Rend Soul will need some significant reworking to do what I need it to do of course, but that shouldn’t be too-*


I was heading back to a desk I’d seen earlier, hoping to get the book copied while there was still a bit of daylight, when one particular title caught my eye.


*‘Plane Shift: Elardia Primary’, if that does what I think it does...*


It was part of a small set, and aside from the one for ‘Elardia Primary’, there was also ‘Elardia Primal Alpha’, ‘Elardia Primal Beta’, and ‘Weisse Primal Primary.’


The author was not the sort to ramble, and between all four books, there was only written a single sentence, scribbled on the inside cover of ‘Plane Shift: Elardia Primary’.


“Of all the spells I’ve put to page, this one is the most important, because it’s the one that gets you home.”


---


The rain had stopped by the time I’d finished scanning the last of the books, and it was just late enough that I was confident of not being seen as I stepped out onto the balcony and cinched up my harness.


*At least, not by anyone who doesn’t already know I’m up here in this stupid tower.*


I’d spent some time of course, considering the problem of spies or bugs, but had not come up with many solutions. I simply didn’t have the experience or the spells to be able to do much about either possibility. All I knew of losing a tail had come from old spy movies and airport thriller novels, and it wasn’t like I could build a bug sweeper out of some electronic bits. Not when the bug, and the spies, used magic instead of technology to do their work. Mostly then it came down to how many bugs, how many spies, and where each of them were.


Victorina must have known that observation was a possibility, and must have swept for bugs, in whatever manner a Mage does such a thing. Perhaps it was overly optimistic, but my guess was that whatever bug they did have was placed in an inconvenient position, and probably overly limited in functionality. Otherwise why blab about it? If they could see everything that went on in the clubhouse, then why tell me? No, they could see a bit, but not everything, and the statement by Bronnippo had then been a bluff. Something meant to unsettle. Of course he would have known that the idea of someone spying on Victorina and I in bed would rattle me, but it was exactly that sort of thing that Victorina would be most on guard about. No, especially with the soundproofing, I was pretty sure that the bedrooms were secured.


*At least they can’t track me with that stupid book Bronippo gave me, no one’s finding that for another hundred years.*


I eased myself, *very* carefully, over the edge of the balcony. Much like I had on the way up, I’d looped the rope through a sturdy support, and then tied both ends off on my harness. That way I’d be able to untie the knot once down at ground level, and would be able to carry the rope away with me once it came time to leave.


Of course, I found some way to screw it up.


With the rope looped as it was, I effectively had two ropes in front of me to hang on to. One was the rope as it came down from the anchor above, and then was tied on to my harness. The other was the rope as it was on its way up to that same anchor. The one tied to me would obviously slide down along with me since I was tied to it, and the other would slide up as the rope played out. I’d grip that second rope in my gloved hands, and would control my descent by slowly letting it slip through my hands.


*Are you starting to figure out where this went wrong?*


Thankfully I’d made it down the first four stories before my mistake started to catch up with me. The rope started to play out faster and faster, and in an attempt to stop it I tightened my grip. I clenched my hands until they hurt, but to no avail. I fell two stories down, and while I slowed my fall a little with the rope, it was only a little.


I hit the ground hard, from a height of at least twenty feet, and the sickening feeling in my gut was beaten out only by the sound that I made when I hit the ground. I managed to protect my head, at least to some extent, and I was pretty sure my skull hadn’t been fractured when it thumped against the tile roof. I would have almost preferred it if my spine had be damaged in the fall, then I might have escaped the absolutely indescribable pain of having every bone in my legs broken, along with both my pelvis and at least one arm.


It hurt so much that it was an effort just to formulate a single thought. And that thought wasn’t about how my break in might be discovered, or that I was mortally wounded but without magic, no, that wasn’t it at all.


*I really hope I didn’t land on my phone.*


----


I came to, maybe a few minutes later, maybe a few hours later, with my vision all a blur. *I’ve lost my glasses, again.* Pain shot through the whole of my lower body as I felt someone huge and solid lift me.


The last words I heard before passing out again were, “Quinn, I am stunned that you’ve survived this long.”






# Chapter 66

**Quinn**

---

*Waking up in strange and unknown places, ah... I’d almost forgotten what it was like.*

As strange and unknown places went though, this one probably smelled the worst. It reeked of beer and urine, and I was pretty sure that the bed I was laying on actually had more in common with a sack of potatoes than an actual mattress. I couldn’t see that well, I’d lost my glasses and with the curtains drawn it was still dark, but wherever this was, I could tell that it was not a very happy place.

I cast a dim red Light, cupping it in my hand so as not to attract too much attention.

The bed at least was not actually a big sack of potatoes, but damn it was close. The sheets were made of sackcloth, and looked like they hadn’t been cleaned any time in the last century. It made me very glad to find that I was still clothed, and laying on top of the covers.

I slowly swept the light around the room, revealing bit by bit a room that made Harp’s inn back in Essens look positively palatial. It startled me slightly when I saw that the chair next to the bed was occupied, but I relaxed a bit once I realized that the hulking form slumped in the chair was Nothus.

*Which explains why my legs don’t feel like a collection of crushed glass.*

She stirred slightly when the light swept across her face, and she blinked her eyes open sleepily.

“You’re awake,” she mumbled, “Good.”

“Where the hell am I?” I asked, as I sat up.

“An inn,” Nothus drawled.

“Really?” I asked raising an eyebrow, “I’m not sure that word applies here. I’m guessing we’re not in a great part of the city?”

“We’re not even in the city,” Nothus replied, rubbing the sleep out of her eyes, “We’re in a town a couple miles outside.”

*What?*

“Why?” I asked, furrowing my brows.

She shrugged, “This is where I usually stay, so I teleported you back here once I finished healing you. What were you even doing in the tower Quinn? That fall could have killed you.”

*This is where she usually stays?*

Rather than answer right away I patted at my pockets, checking that my phone was still there. I drew it out, and unlocked it. It was no worse for wear, and opening the reader app showed the long list of books I’d scanned.

“Research,” I said finally, “How did you even know I was in there?”

“The rope dangling down from the balcony might have been a clue,” she replied wryly.

“And you just happened to be taking a stroll on the roof while I was climbing down?” I challenged.

“Maybe I spotted you out of a window?” she provided.

“I don’t need to be an empath to know that’s bullshit,” I replied.

“Fine,” she relented, “That *is* how I did it actually.”

“Oh?”

“Sometimes I have trouble sleeping,” she explained, “So I’ll go for a walk, or read in the Library. I like it, there’s few people around, and those that I might pick up through the wall of their houses and such are usually asleep, so their emotions are muted. Or if I’m in the Library late at night there’s almost no one else around, and it’s an awfully big building, I can usually find a quiet corner.”

“Ah,” I said, understanding, “Not much interference from other people’s emotions, you sensed me in the tower.”

“Yes,” she nodded, “It was hard to work out what was going on at first, since I’d have long periods of emotional silence, and then brief flashes of giddy discovery. But I realized just who it could be after a little while.”

“And your empathy works even in an antimagic field?” I asked, and she nodded again, “Cool.”

“Are you going to tell me what you were ‘researching’?” she asked.

“Nope,” I said flatly, “I do have a *completely* unrelated question though.”

“Oh really?”

“Would you be able to detect magical bugs?”

She frowned, “Magical... bugs?”

“Listening enchantments,” I clarified.

“Oh, yes. Is that your concern?” she asked, “Because I sincerely doubt that anyone is going to be able to get such a ‘bug’ in place without me detecting it.”

“This room is secure then?” I asked.

“Yes, will you tell me what you were doing now?” she persisted.

I grimaced, “Probably still a no to that one. However, if I succeed at the stupid and risky thing I’m preparing for, would I be able to count on your help for what would come after?”

She rolled her eyes, “You’re not going to tell me any of the details, and you’re going to expect me to keep quiet about your trespassing, but you expect me to agree to help you? Sight unseen?”

“Exactly,” I grinned.

She sighed, “I can’t believe I’m agreeing to this, fine. But what do you mean when you say that you want my help with what comes after? Don’t you want me help with the stupid and risky thing?”

I shook my head, “No, that I’ve got to do alone.”

“Thinking of Minki?” she asked softly.

I nodded reluctantly, “I imagine that’s influencing my decision quite a bit, but it’s not the only reason. Without elaborating more, I’ve come to realize that it’s going to be easier to do what I need to do, if I’m the only idiot there. Actually,” I continued, “I wanted to ask you about something. If I needed to vastly increase the speed at which I could cast a spell, is there an easy way to do that? Aside from just studying the spell more?”

She raised a questioning eyebrow, but answered all the same, “You could create a spellstone ahead of time, that would make the casting almost instant. It’s single use though, you’d need a separate spellstone for each casting.”

“Is it expensive?”

“It’s about ten times normal casting cost,” she explained.

*Casting my modified Rend Soul won’t be too hard then. But dispelling the enchantment... Damn, that’s going to cost a couple hundred energy at least.*

“Is that going to be a problem?” she asked.

“Do my emotions betray me?”

“A little,” she admitted.

“I’ll figure it out,” I told her, as I finally stood up, “I need to get back to the clubhouse, have a shower, and get ready for class, which is in...” I checked my watch, “A little over an hour. But, if you’re really so good at detecting listening enchantments I’d like to hire you to check out the clubhouse.”

“Hire me? And is Victorina going to be okay with that?” she asked, unsure.

I shrugged, “If you find bugs she hasn’t I doubt she’ll mind. I might have had someone visit me while I was in the tower, and they might have implied that there are bugs in the clubhouse. They might just be giving me the runaround, but I’d like to know for sure. And yeah, hire. I insist.”

“Oh, well if you insist your imperial highness, then I suppose I must agree,” she said, standing and bowing low to the ground, “Will your imperial highness deign to teleport us to your clubhouse, or shall I carry you.”

“Oh shut up and stand over here,” I told her, as I started concentrating on the spell.

I realized, when she came to stand next to me, that she was even shorter now than when I’d last seen her. She’d lost another couple of inches in height and couldn’t have been more than an inch or two taller than Brandy, though Nothus was still comically muscular as always.

---

There was a flicker, and we escaped the stinking dive that was Nothus’s inn, to the luxury of Victorina’s clubhouse.

The others were already up, as they too had classes to get to, and our presence was noticed pretty quickly.

“Quinn,” Minki said, from the balcony above the front hall, “You’re back!”

I could hear a door open somewhere upstairs at Minki’s exclamation, but I was distracted by the little grey mop of hair that threw itself down the stairs to thump into my stomach.

“I did say that I’d be back,” I noted wryly, as I patted her on the back.

“Well,” she said, “I was worried. I was expecting you to be back sooner, you might have missed your class if you were any later,” she sniffed, and took a step back ,”You’re all smelly and dirty. What were you doing?”

“It’s a secret,” I replied secretively.

“And you’ve brought Nothus,” came Victorina’s level voice from the balcony above, and I could hear the unspoken question in her voice.

*Is this who you’ve been with since running away?*

“Quinn’s hired me to check for magical listening enchantment,” Nothus replied, and I was sure from the overly diplomatic tone she used that she’d picked up on *exactly* what was going on between Victorina and I.

“Is that a problem?” Nothus finished.

“No,” Victorina allowed, “And you think that there are such enchantments, Quinn?”

“I had a visitor while I was away,” I explained, “They may just have intended to rattle me, but they did know things that they shouldn’t have.”

Victorina nodded in understanding, but otherwise kept quiet.

“Go get washed up and ready for class Quinn,” Minki said, “I can babysit Nothus while she has a walk around.”

“Thanks Minki,” I said, ruffling her hair on the way by.

“Hey!” she protested, and I dodged her flailing arms as I escaped to my room.

---

I hadn’t even been in been in my room for a full minute before there was a tapping on the door.

“Come in Victorina,” I said.

She opened the door and stepped through quietly, before closing it gently behind her.

We were both quiet for a long while, as we stood there looking at each other from either side of the room. I was deep into *very* unfamiliar territory, it was not often that I was the one to end a relationship.

*Not often? This is the first time.*

Before when things had come to an end I had known that it was my own doing. I rarely knew what it was that I’d done, but there was never any doubt that it *was* my own doing. Of course, that didn’t make it hurt any less with Victorina. In fact, it probably hurt more.

*Betrayal, now that’s a new one.*

“Is there anything left to be said?” she asked finally.

“Not really.”

“Will you stay?” she asked.

“With the club? Yes.”

“But not with me.”

“No. I’m sorry.”

She looked away, unwilling to meet my gaze, “You really did trust me completely didn’t you?”

“Yeah,” I said, though it came out as a rasp.

“I’m sorry.”

“I know,” I said sadly.

“Thank you for staying Quinn,” she said finally, “It’s good having you here, even if...” she trailed off.

“It’s like I told you before Victorina,” I said, “I owe you a great deal. What you did doesn’t change that, not one bit. I’m not going anywhere any time soon, and you’re still my friend, even if that’s all it is between us.”

She nodded, “And your plan? Did you get what you needed?”

“Yeah,” I nodded, “We can talk more once Nothus has done her sweep.”

“Alright,” she said, turning to the door, a little too quickly, “Ah, you and Nothus?”

“Are just friends.”

“Like you and I,” she said, a little bitterly.

“Exactly like that.”

“So Nothus?” I asked, as I joined her and the others in the sitting room a little while later.

“I found the enchantments,” she explained, “There was only two of them. One right there,” she said, pointing to the balcony doors, “And another on the front door.”

“Dammit,” Halea swore, “I should have thought of that.”

“What?” I asked.

“It’s not actually that hard to detect listening enchantments,” Nothus explained, “Not when they’re out in the open, and not if you’re a Mage. All you really need to do is look for places where the ambient mana is being drawn in, without some other obvious enchantment in place to explain the drain.”

“So what the Tanakas did was mask the enchantment within the *much* more mana intensive defensive enchantments around each of the doors,” Halea finished.

“And the doors are particularly thickly enchanted?” I asked, “Couldn’t they have more placed along the walls or something?”

Nothus shook her head, “Not really, the doors draw a lot more mana. There’s enchantments to control who can come and go, switching enchantments to allow the door to open while keeping the defences up, and all manner of other enchantments that are placed on only the doors and nothing else.”

“Windows?”

“I checked them too, but those don’t draw quite as much mana as the doors so it’s harder to hide things,” Nothus shook her head, “There’s nothing there.”

“Thank you Nothus,” Victorina said, “I don’t suppose...”

“You’re welcome,” Nothus said, “But no. I’m fine on my own.”

“Well then,” I said, “I’ll be back after class, Victorina, Minki, and I’ll let you two know just what the hell it is I’ve got planned.”

“Do I get to know what the hell it is you’ve got planned?” Nothus asked.

“Nope! But you can be sure that I’ll brag about it afterwards.”

---

I had to do a double take the first time I saw Mata, the ‘new’ Mata that is, sitting with Diova and company in our Spell Invention class.

Take Victorina for example, she was gorgeous, and *very* generously proportioned. If she was human, she would have been an example of the absolute limit of what a human woman could ever naturally achieve.

Halea, well now she was a bit past that limit, but not too far. If Victorina had movie star proportions, then Halea had porn star proportions. There was some clear artificiality going on there, but it was still tastefully done. She didn’t look absurd for example.

Mata, she looked absurd. Maybe elven views on such things were different, and I was reminded briefly of the cultural differences between even Victorina and I, but to me she just looked grotesque. Mata looked like she had a couple of watermelons shoved up the front of her robes, and whatever potion or enchantment she’d taken must have rearranged some of her internal organs and restructured her rib cage, since there was no way in hell that any sort of corset was going to narrow her waist *that* much.

*Is she even going to be able to speak with her lips all puffy like that? Fucking hell Diova.*

Maybe I shouldn’t have been surprised. I was dealing of course with a society that showed wealth and opulence by plastering everything in gold leaf. It only made sense that such people would modify their toys in the same way.

“Quinn, have you heard the good news?” Diova asked, as I sat down across from him.

“I suppose that depends on what the news is,” I said, glancing at Baron Bronippo, who along with Tosa, was also at the table.

“The professor has said that there was a discussion in the battle magic department. Once we get Solar Pulse polished up they’ll be adding it to the curriculum immediately.”

“Damn, that is good news,” I agreed, “Also, you’re welcome.”

Diova raised an eyebrow, but didn’t comment.

“What have you got for us once we’re done with Solar Pulse then?” Tosa asked.

“Oh, a few ideas. I wanted to try an enchantment actually, we should be able to make a half decent horseless carriage.”

“Isn’t there already an existing enchantment that can be used to make a wheel or axle turn?” the Baron asked, “I think that’s been done before, it never really works out very well either. The creations are nearly undrivable.”

“We’d be modifying the enchantment, as we did with Solaris to turn it into Solar Pulse. All the existing enchantment does is rotate the axle or what have you at a constant rate, and that’s not what we want.”

“It’s not?” Mata asked, the words thick in her mouth as she tried to talk around her comically large lips.

“Nope,” I confirmed, “I mean, we could put a clutch or some other gearing arrangement between the enchantment and the wheels, but then we’re losing mana efficiency. Better to make the enchantment itself work, rather than try to kludge together a solution that would make the existing one work at the task.”

“And aside from that,” Diova added, “We wouldn’t get any credit for working with the *existing* enchantment.”

“Exactly,” I agreed, “I do want to get to Solar Pulse today, but I’ll sketch out the general idea,” I said, as I pulled a pad of paper towards me.

“The main thing we would need,” I began, “Is a way to vary the rate of rotation...”

---

The conversation with Victorina didn't take long at all, mostly because I didn’t tell her much that she didn’t already know. I needed her, but like Nothus, I’d only need her for what came after I claimed the guild hall. I needed Victorina to help me manage the political side of things, mainly in and around Azarburg. What was the political situation like in the city? Who mattered, and why did they matter? Did they pay taxes to the University, or just tribute to Nezzabi? It was one big mess, but one that Victorina was well suited to solving, so that was her task.

Nothus, well, I didn’t really have a task in mind for her, but I knew that I wanted her on the team. She seemed overly solitary, even to me, but there had to be something that I could offer her to get her to come on board.

And the last of the three was Minki. I’d originally intended for her task to fall to Victorina, but after the events of the past few days, I realized that I couldn’t trust Victorina as much as I thought I could. Minki would be the one to ensure that my claim to the guild hall was upheld. She’d enter the claim at the given time, ideally only seconds after the curse was lifted, naming me as the guild hierarch. She’d also ensure that any loopholes and counter-claims were defended against.

“But isn’t Kennocha the one who normally does all this sort of thing?” she asked, after I’d finished telling her what I needed from her, “She knows all about administering things. She does all the paperwork for the club, handles all the bills, everything. What if I mess it up?” she worried.

I knelt down in front of her, “I need someone I can trust to do this Minki, and I’ve got to be able to trust them completely. I do trust Kennocha, I really do. But not completely, not when there’s this much on the line. And Victorina, well, I’m guessing you know now how that went.”

She nodded slightly, “Yeah,” she whispered.

“It’s got to be you.”

She nodded again, “Alright Quinn, I’ll do it.”

---

“So what’s the plan for today then?” Nothus asked, a couple days later and after we’d met up at our Healing class.

“Well, I’ve been thinking about you, and I’ve had some interesting ideas.”

“Oh? Late at night, when you’re alone, thinking of me?”

“Exactly,” I laughed, “I know you’ve been looking for new ways to make yourself stronger, without just turning yourself into a living mountain, and I’ve got a couple of suggestions.”

“So, you’re only interested in me for my body then?” she laughed.

“Basically, come on, we’ll find a place to eat, and I’ll tell you about a Canadian hero.”

---

“Metal claws?” she asked incredulously, as she was mid way through a mountain of food.

“So you can stab people and stuff,” I said, waving my hands around in vague slashing gestures.

“Stab people and stuff,” she recited, eyebrow raised.

“Or threaten people with stabbing,” I offered placatingly, “You’re skeptical, I get that. Let's table the metal claws discussion for now, and move on to a different awesome idea I’ve had.”

“Please,” she said in an amused tone, “Continue.”

“Carbon nanotubes.”

She sighed, “What?”

“Diamond,” I paused, “Bones.”

“Diamond bones?”

“Well, sort of. Carbon nanotubes are better actually, you wouldn’t need to worry about them shattering. Imagine,” I said, “Super strong and super light bones.”

“That does sound better than the claws thing,” she admitted.

“You might be able to apply the same theories to your muscles as well to increase your muscle density, but I’m a lot less sure about that one.”

“Explain it to me then. And maybe, *maybe* we can look into the metal claws afterwards,” she promised.



# Chapter 67

**Halea**

---

“Haven’t we got anything bigger than that?” I asked.

Neferoy rolled her eyes, “Of course you’d be the one to find the size somehow inadequate.”

I shrugged, “I know what I like.”

Minki, who had turned a little pink, shook her head, “The two largest bases we found were for twelve point manastones, and we’ve already sold those, along with the extra ten point stones.”

“Was it not worth it for us to keep the twelve point stones?” I asked.

“Not really,” Neferoy replied, “If I lead an enchanting circle with the whole club, we’ve got a ten point stone for everyone. Including an extra helper, if we can find someone else to join us. All we’d gain by swapping two people’s stones out for twelve pointers is four mana. It’s not enough to matter.”

“So how much mana can we muster up at any one time then?” I asked distractedly, as I hovered the teapot over from the sideboard to refill my cup.

“About one sixty, to one seventy. Depends mostly on whether we catch Quinn when he’s fresh,” Neferoy replied.

“I think I might be able to contribute a little more than I have been doing,” Minki provided, “I’ve been practising with using my enervation to cast spells.”

“Really?” Neferoy asked, her bushy eyebrows raised, “I can’t say that you’re the first person I’d think of to try that sort of thing.”

Minki shrugged, “Ever since Quinn and Nothus... did what they did for me, I’ve felt a lot more energetic. I don’t get tired as easily, and I don’t feel so winded when I need to walk somewhere in the city. I haven’t had a chance to re-test my abilities, but I’d guess that I’ve got about as much enervation as Brandy does now.”

“That’s great news Minki,” Neferoy said, “I suppose the events leading up to the new you might not have been terribly pleasant, but I don’t think I’m the only one who’s noticed how much more comfortable you seem with yourself now.”

It was more than just being more comfortable in her own body, Minki *looked* different now. The changes were quite subtle, but they were noticeable to anyone who had more than a passing acquaintance with her.

It called to mind the difference between what a person actually looked like, and how you might remember them. Little details tend to get amplified, especially if you’ve not seen the person in question for some time. Someone tall might be a little taller when seen only in your mind’s eye, or the colour of their hair or eyes a little more vivid. You remember not the person, but a caricature of the person, built by your memories.

*And Minki, she looks just like that caricature.*

There was a sudden shock, like some combination of a cold bucket of water being dumped over my head, and a loud and discordant note.

It took me a moment to shake it off, and I was left with an uncomfortable shudder running down my spine.

“Agh, that was damned unpleasant,” Neferoy said, as she hunched her shoulders against the odd sensation that the wave of dischordant magic left in it’s wake.

“Felt like it came from somewhere behind the clubhouse,” I noted, as I stood and walked to the balcony doors at the rear of the sitting room.

“Oh!” Minki exclaimed, “Do you think it was Quinn? He was back there working on his rifle.”

“I doubt it,” I said, “That was a pretty sizable Mishap. Quinn’s a better Mage than that.”

“He might have just gotten unlucky, Halea,” Neferoy warned.

“Maybe,” I granted, “But I don’t think that even Quinn is *that* unlucky. I’ll check on him though, let him know what that was at least. That’s probably the first time he’ll have felt anything like it.”

I pushed open the doors and stepped out onto the balcony, and took a look around before returning inside.

“Anything?” Neferoy asked.

“Didn’t see him, I’ll go down and look around. Besides, it’s about time for supper. Maybe if I bat my eyelashes at him he’ll make us something to eat.”

---

Quinn’s things were still lying on the patio table he’d appropriated for his work, and while it looked as if he’d just stepped away, I couldn’t find him anywhere nearby.

*I really hope he didn’t vaporize himself. I’d have a hard time explaining that to Victorina.*

I sat down at the table, and had a little poke around. His ‘rifle’ seemed mostly to be a brass tube, with some wood furnishings that reminded me of the stock of a crossbow. There was a large opening where one of the large boxy ‘magazines’ might fit, though Quinn hadn’t left any of the boxy creations in his weapon. There were several strewn across the top of the table though, all in varying states of completion.

*A little underwhelming if you ask me. I would have expected something more complicated than a brass tube with a bit of wood nailed to it, and a box with a spring inside.*

But that was Outsiders for you, some of their most valuable information was so simple as to be scarcely unbelievable once you grew to understand it.

I heard a little skittering sound under the table, and gave a start. I pushed my chair back, knocking it over in my haste to get to my feet, and took several steps back.

*Dangerous heroines are not afraid of mice Halea. Calm down.*

I stood the chair back up, and then knelt down, a safe distance away, to peer under the table. The grass under it hadn’t been cut, and was five or six inches tall, which served well to hide whatever tiny animal had taken shelter under Quinn’s work area.

*Are humans afraid of mice? Do they even have mice on Earth?*

The grass stirred slightly in the breeze, but I didn’t notice anything move out of turn.

*This is boring.*

“BOO!” I shouted, slapping my hands on the ground.

Something indistinct and dark blue jumped up at the loud noise, and I heard a tiny voice shout, “Fuck!”

“Quinn?” I chortled.

“Oh for fucks sake,” the voice said again, and a moment later, Quinn was pushing his way out of the shoulder high forest of grass.

“Oh, I have got to show the others,” I cried, as I reached to scoop him up, “They’re going to *love* this.”

He tried to dart away, but I caught him gently by the back of his robes, and dropped him into the palm of my hand.

“I hate you so much right now.”

It was definitely Quinn, but much *much* shorter. He was maybe three inches tall, but otherwise seemed none the worse for wear.

“Maybe Minki’s got some little dolly clothes we can dress you up in,” I cooed.

It was hard to tell, since Quinn wasn’t even the length of one of my fingers, but it looked an awful lot like Quinn was bright red.

“Halea, please,” he said, “You can’t let the others see me like this.”

“Why not?” I laughed, “It’s not fair if I’m the only one who gets to enjoy this.”

I heard the click of the clubhouse door opening, followed by Victorina’s voice, “Halea, you find Quinn?”

“And you certainly can’t let *her* see me like this,” Quinn hissed.

“Fine,” I huffed, before dropping him down the front of my robes, which elicited a whispered protest from Quinn, “Now don’t you move around too much, or the others will notice. No,” I called out, raising my voice, “He’s not back here.”

I felt Quinn squirming around a little as I turned away from the table and climbed the steps back up to the clubhouse, but if Victorina noticed something odd, she didn’t let it show.

“You just get back?” I asked.

Victornia nodded, “I was hoping that there might be supper waiting, I’m starving.”

“He’s been spending a lot of time on that new weapon of his, I imagine he’s out getting more of whatever it is he needs to work on it.”

“That Mishap the others mentioned then, that wasn’t him?”

I shook my head, “I got out there pretty quick, I would have sensed if the epicentre was somewhere in the back garden. Why, are you worried about him?”

She opened her mouth to speak, before stopping herself and shaking her head in resignation.

I stopped, just at the foot of the stairs that lead back up to the sitting room, and she drew up short, “You still care about him?” I asked quietly.

She nodded sadly, “I just wanted to be sure, do you know what I mean?” she asked, “Quinn seemed so genuine, and when we had our little dominance games, it was just a bit of flirty fun, and not an attempt by him to gain some sort of control over me. But...”

“You’ve been burned before,” I grimaced, “Yeah, I remember.”

“And then,” she continued, “By trying to *make sure*, I just sarded the whole thing up.”

“Think you can fix it?” I asked.

“No,” she said sadly, “Quinn and I talked... It didn’t last long, but it didn’t really need to. He’s never going to trust me again, not as he once did, and I couldn’t bear going on like that. Not when I’d be thinking every minute of how it used to be between us.”

“Well, if you’d like my unsolicited advice,” I told her, “The best thing to do is get blind drunk, and then throw yourself at the first warm body that’s not going to get you knocked up.”

“Is that how you normally get over a breakup?” she laughed, though I could see she was trying to hold back a few stray tears.

“I’m exaggerating of course, but only slightly,” I said, taking her gently by the shoulders, “Go fall into bed with someone cute. You’ll feel better, and it’ll be a lot easier to move on afterwards. I don’t think Quinn’s  going anywhere any time soon, and you’re going to need to be able to keep working together in a professional manner, without letting the baggage between the two of you get in the way. And,” I continued, “You’ve also got to be able to deal with the fact that you’re not the only one that’s going to be hopping into bed with someone else.”

“You among them?” she asked, though thankfully she sounded exasperated, rather than territorial.

I shrugged, and felt Quinn slip a little further down as I did, “I might let him get all up in this,” I smirked.

“I suppose I shouldn’t be surprised,” she laughed sadly, and stepped into my arms, to give me a quick hug, “Thanks for talking to me Halea.”

“You’re welcome,” I told her, patting her gently on the back.

“Alright,” she said, stepping away, and visibly centring herself, “Now, enough of this nonsense. We’re going out to eat, and Quinn can take care of his own silly self.”

“I would love to join you, but I’ve got an assignment due Louday and I’ve barely started. Next time,” I promised.

She gave me a look that seemed somehow motherly in its disappointment, *I suppose we’re done with the sisterly talk then.*

“Its fine,” I said defensively, “It’s for battlemagic, I’ll probably be done before you get back.”

“Well enjoy your time to work alone then. The rest of us,” she said, “Will be off at dinner.”

*Yes, definitely motherly.*

----

I pushed the door shut with my foot, and slipped a hand down the front of my robes to retrieve Quinn. I snagged the hood of his robes, and lifted him up to dangle at eye level.

“You know,” he squeeked, retaining a surprising amount of dignity, “I’m really glad it’s been a cool couple of days.”

I raised one elegant eyebrow, “I am a lady,” I said haughtily, “I do not sweat.”

“Well I certainly appreciate that, your ladyship. Now, how the hell do I fix this?”

I carried him over to my desk, and set him down on it, “I’ve no idea really. It’s not permanent at least,” I assured him, “I know that for sure, but not much else.”

“For sure, for sure?” he asked, “Shouldn’t it have worn off already if it’s not permanent? I didn’t put that much energy into the spell, and I didn’t cast it as an enchantment.”

I pulled the chair out and sat down, resting my chin on my interlaced fingers.

“Mishaps don’t work like normal spells,” I explained, “I’m probably not the best person to explain it, you’d want to ask Lili or maybe Neferoy, but from what I understand, Mishaps can draw in more than the normal amount of ambient mana. So it will wear off,” I promised, “But it could take a while.”

He sat down and took off his spectacles to rub at his face, “How long is ‘a while’?” he asked.

“The *longest* I’ve ever heard of a Mishap lasting is a week-”

“A week!”

“Probably only a couple of hours though,” I finished.

“I suppose I can deal with that,” he grumbled.

I reached out, and pet the top of his head with one finger, “What were you even doing out there Quinn?”

He bat ineffectually at my tree trunk like finger, but eventually resigned himself to his fate, “Magazines are dumb,” he said simply.

“Is that so?”

He nodded his widdle head, *oh he’s just so cute,* “The gun itself is simple. Incredibly simple. It’s a pipe with a bomb and a bit of lead in it. Set off the bomb, and the bit of lead goes flying at whoever it is you don’t like. I mean, it’s reductive, but that’s really all there is to it. The hard part is setting off the bomb in a controlled manner. My Uncle is using a simple matchlock, which basically amounts to burning wick on a lever. My gun is a bit more complicated since it’s bolt action and uses a striker, but even then, I managed to make a working version *without* Reshape, once I’d gotten it right the first time.”

“How is the magazine giving you so much trouble then?” I asked, “And how exactly does any of this result in your currently reduced stature?”

“Oh, I’d just gotten fed up with trying to make the magazines work, and had moved on to experimenting with shrinking down one of my guns. I actually got it working. Well... mostly,” he hedged, gesturing down at himself, “As you can see, there are some issues.”

“You were using your modified version of the spell?" I asked.

“Yeah,” he grimaced, “Hopefully it was bad luck, and not something endemic to the modifications I made.”

I shrugged, “Show it to Lili, she’ll be able to give you an idea of how you might fix it, if it even needs fixing.”

He flopped back on the desk, resting his head in his hands, “That’s probably a good idea.”

I drummed my fingers on the desk, “Do you think you can make the magazine work? Once you get back to full size, that is.”

“Probably not,” he said honestly, “The issue is the springs. The magazines work at first, for the first... oh, couple dozen rounds. Then you start to get feeding issues, which get worse and worse as you go on.”

“Feeding?” I asked.

“The process of getting the cartridge out of the magazine and into the chamber,” he clarified, “It needs to be smooth, and if the spring in the magazine doesn’t lift the cartridge up high enough, or lifts it too high, then it doesn’t go in smoothly.”

“Mmm, and it *must* go in smoothly.”

He snorted, “Yeah, and if it doesn’t, the gun can get jammed up. It’s manageable at first if you’re careful, though its much less than ideal. It becomes completely unusable very quickly though. I don’t know enough about metallurgy to make spring steel, and none of what I can find or make otherwise with bronze or copper is likely to do the trick.”

“Couldn’t you just replace the magazines once they get worn out though?” I asked, “You’ve got Reshape, it wouldn’t be hard for you to recycle the metal. Even if you can only use it a few times before its no good, you’re not going to be using your rifle that much, not when it’s only a backup for your magic. I mean, it’s not like you’re trying to outfit an army.”

Quinn, was suddenly very quiet.

*Oh.*

“Quinn...” I said hesitantly, “I don’t suppose this has anything to do with the way you disappeared for a couple of days the other week?”

“Uh, nope. Certainly not.”

“And when you were asking Neferoy about how you might go about accumulating a couple hundred mana, that’s also entirely unrelated?

“Exactly.”

“Why does it feel like there’s something significant you’re not telling me?”

He sat up, and gave me a long and thoughtful look, before letting his gaze fall back to the table. Which for him, was the floor.

“I’m playing this one pretty close to the chest Halea. Only two other people know what I’m planning, and even then, they’re both missing pieces of the puzzle. Once I reach the next step, I’ll be able to tell everyone in the club, but I’m keeping it to myself until then.”

“Victorina and Minki?” I guessed.

He shrugged.

“I understand.”

“Thanks,” he said simply.

I leaned my chair back on two legs and let out a long breath. *Just what is it that he’s got Minki into?*

“You know,” Quinn said, a moment later, “This is the part where I’d normally make some excuse to leave, before going off to hide in the library, but that’s kinda difficult when I’m too small to turn the pages.”

“Can’t you just Apport the pages?” I asked lazily.

“Tried that,” he said, “Well, not quite with pages. Regardless, the strength of Apportation seems to be proportional to my reduced size. Being three inches tall is not terribly convenient.”

“Well,” I grinned, still staring up at the ceiling, “I think I can find some way to keep you entertained until the enchantment wears off. Maybe you’d like me to stuff you back down my robes?” I asked, “Or, mmm, yes. I can think of a few interesting places that you’d fit.”

I looked back down at the table, to see Quinn already on his feet and sprinting for the far edge.

He narrowly avoided a swipe of one massive hand as he leapt from the table, and by the time I’d gotten out of the chair and around to the other side of the desk he was already on the floor and running for the bed.

“You’ll never catch me Becky!” he shouted.

I bent down to swipe at him, but just as I was about to get my hands on him he cast Leap, and flew free of my clutching fingers.

Rather than swipe at him while he was in the air, and risk hurting him, I pounced on him the moment he landed. I caught him in a cage of my fingers, but gingerly, as if he were a butterfly or glow bug. But unlike butterflies and glow bugs, Quinn could teleport.

“Hey!” I protested, when he reappeared just under the bed, “Teleportation is cheating.”

“It’s only fair,” he shouted back, “I haven’t even got a Zooper Car, and you’re all big!”

“Big? You think I’m *big*?” I said with pantomime fury, though my giggling probably spoiled the effect, “I’m going to catch you, and then you’re going to tell me who the hell Becky is.”

----

We kept up our little game of cat and mouse throughout my bedroom and the rest of the clubhouse for at least a couple of hours, until Quinn’s Mishap finally ran through the supply of ambient mana it had picked up. The two of us were left tired and panting on the floor in the library, because of course it was the library, this was Quinn we’re talking about.

“I thought ladies didn’t sweat,” he teased, as I mopped at by brow with the sleeve of my robes.

“Oh hush, I would have thought that your human endurance would have handled this better,” I shot back, “But you look like a wreck.”

“I ran a lot further than you did,” he retorted.

“No you didn’t,” I challenged, “I was running around the same clubhouse that you were.”

“Sure,” he allowed, “But it’s a matter of scale. Imagine if it was the clubhouse that had grown, rather than one of us shrinking. Each step in the stairs would the height of a two storey building, and the clubhouse would be almost a mile across.”

“Fine,” I huffed, “I defer to your superior math skills.”

I lifted my head from the floor, to peer at him sitting with his back against one of the bookshelves.

“The others aren't back yet,” I noted.

“Nope,” he agreed.

“It’s late,” I pointed out

“It is,” he agreed.

We were both quiet for a moment, and then I lay back and let out a sigh, “Not tonight though.”

“Not tonight,” he agreed.


# Chapter 68

**Quinn**

---

*Is there an easy way to pull three hundred mana out of thin air? Of course not Quinn, if there were, everyone would do it.*

It had been about a week and a half since my return from the tower, and while I’d learned the spells I’d need for my plan, there were other problems.

The first of which was the mana. I now knew the exact enchantment that the Ariros guild members had used nearly a thousand years ago, which theoretically meant that I knew how to dispel it. The problem was a matter of speed. It was only thirty mana to dispel the enchantment, but with the large manastone we made from the crystals retrieved from the cave, that was totally something I could manage. But not quickly. It would take at least an hour and a half to dispel the enchantment the ‘normal’ way, and I didn’t have anywhere near that time. I could afford to let the wraith take a bite out of me, in fact, the plan pretty much required it, but an hour and a half of that was far more than I’d be able to endure.

I could cut down the casting time drastically by using a spell stone, but that had its own troubles. Yes, it would cast the spell effectively instantaneously as long as it had been prepared properly, but it was not cheap. If you wanted to cast a spell worth one mana, you needed to put ten mana in to actually construct the spell stone.

*Which means, I need to find 300 mana somewhere, or find some way to survive an hour and a half of the wraith’s attention.*

“I guess you haven’t figured out the solution to your mystery problem yet?” Nothus asked, startling me back to reality.

The two of us had found a quiet corner of the Library to work in, and she was just now rejoining me after having spent a little while wandering around and gathering more research material.

“Is it that obvious?” I asked, as she set down a stack of books on the desk.

“Pretty sure I don’t need to be an empath to recognize when you can’t find the solution to a problem,” she teased, “You tend to get all grumbly.”

“Well that’s the problem. I actually do have a solution. It’s just a terrible one,” I grumbled, *spend soul, and by doing so, waste the extra 700 energy that wasn’t consumed by the spell stone.*

“Maybe you just need to relax, work on something else for a while, or just pay more attention to your classes,” she suggested.

“I pay plenty of attention to my classes,” I retorted, “And I doubt I’ll find the solution there.”

“Do you really?” she smiled, “Besides, that’s not really what I mean. When you’re having trouble with a problem you tend to go work on something else for a while, and come back to it. But I’m pretty sure you’ve been stewing over this, whatever *this* is, for weeks now. Go do something else, I’m sure it can wait Quinn.”

I shrugged, “Maybe you’re right. I’ve still got to get Solar Pulse finished up, and there’s supposed to be a couple of team matches in the Arena with my battle magic class that I could be preparing for.”

“See, that sounds perfect,” she said encouragingly, “And if you can’t come up with a solution after all of that, then I suppose you could resort to elf sacrifice or something.”

*...now that’s not a terrible idea...*

“Quinn,” she said, suddenly very serious, “You know that was a joke, right?”

“What? Oh, of course,” I said reassuringly, “I wasn’t thinking about elf sacrifice at all.”

She gave me a flat look, “Empath, remember?”

“Empath, but not mind reader,” I agreed, “But you should be able to sense that when I say I’m not planning on sacrificing any elves, that’s it’s the truth.”

“I can also tell that you’re being deceptive,” she said knowingly, “Just... Try not to get yourself expelled.”

“Yes mom,” I said in my best rebellious teenager voice, but she just rolled her eyes, “What about the carbon nanotube thing I showed you, have you been able to make any use of that?”

“Oh, you have no idea,” she said, grinning widely, “The first time I woke up after doing the switch, replacing my muscle fibres and strengthening my bones like you suggested,” she clarified, “I accidentally tore the door off of its hinges when I went to go down for breakfast. I haven’t even replaced everything yet, I’m still mostly an elf/human hybrid, since I want to take the time to get used to it gradually. I don’t want to accidentally tear off someone’s arm when I shake their hand.”

“That’s great,” I congratulated her, “And I guess it explains why you’ve kept downsizing. You probably don’t really need the mass any more.”

She was probably a little under six feet now, though she’d still be confused for a man by anyone that didn’t know of her. Her hair, previously worn back in a loose ponytail, was now cut short like mine, which set her apart from most of the elf women who preferred to keep theirs long. She was still thickly muscled, and entirely flat chested, which when combined with her bullet like head made her look every bit like The Rock. A slightly smaller Rock though, as she had slimmed down a bit from the extreme levels she’d been at when she was still seven feet tall.

She nodded, though I caught something *off* about the way she averted her gaze, “I’ve been slimming down a little as well, dropping most of my mass as I slowly replace what I keep with the nanotubes. I couldn’t quite replace my bones entirely, but even with the reinforcements I’ve been able to make, I’m pretty sure they’re mostly indestructible.”

“I wonder if the Arena has rules about that sort of thing,” I mused, “Could you just rush the guy and punch him?”

“I don’t know, maybe,” she said absently, “Um, you know what, I’ve got some errands to run,” she explained, as she stood up, “I might be back a while later, if you’re still here.”

“Oh, I’ll be here for a while,” I assured her, “If not, you might find me down at the cafe across the street.”

-----

I must have fallen asleep at some point, because it had grown dark by the time I woke up. There was little light coming in through the windows, and the small study area was lit only by the single oil lantern that sat on the table. It too had burned down, and cast the whole area in a flickering orange light.

I reached over and turned the wheel that adjusted the length of the wick, making a mental note to enchant a portable light whenever I got the chance.

*Or just buy one I guess.*

I heard muffled footsteps approaching, quieted by the carpet that covered the floors, and looked up expecting to see Nothus.

It was not Nothus.

It was instead, a *very* beautiful young elf. *Or young looking at least.* Her messy dark grey hair, along with the way that she was shyly peeking around the bookshelf, reminded me of Minki. This elf was taller though, if only a little, and while she had the same grey eyes, she didn’t have Minki’s generally rumpled look.

“Are you Quinn?” she asked, in a soft and hopeful voice.

It made her sound almost naive or pleading, which could very well mean that she actually was in fact a young and not just young *looking* elf.

*Either that, or she had her age frozen before she even turned seventeen.*

“Yeah,” I said, taking off my glasses and rubbing sleep out of my eyes, “Why, can I help you?”

“Um, maybe,” she said, taking a furtive step forwards, “Or, maybe I can help you?”

“Oh?” I asked, more than a little confused.

“I heard that you were the one who came up with the new version of Solaris,” she said, coming closer still, and looking me dead in the eyes.

I nodded, “Yeah, that was me.”

“Well I think it’s really good, what you’re doing,” she said, really quite close now, “I think you’re a hero.”

I swallowed, “That’s, uh, very kind of you,” I said, leaning back a little.

“My family was attacked by vampires once,” she whispered, “Maybe if there were more men like *you* around back then, they would never have needed to worry.”

She placed one knee on my chair just between my legs, and leaned in rather close, her huge grey eyes filling my whole field of view.

“Maybe someone ought to show you some gratitude,” she whispered into my ear, before wrapping one arm around my neck and drawing me into a passionate kiss.

Her presence was overwhelming, and made it hard to form a coherent thought. I felt one of her hands slip into the front of my robe and go prowling around, and I found myself responding rather positively to her touch.

She pulled back finally, giving me a chance to come up for air, but she kept her face just inches from mine. Her huge grey eyes staring into mine.

“Come on,” she said in her innocent, pleading, voice, “Let’s go somewhere quiet, and I can show you just how grateful I am.”

My thoughts came thick and slow, and I was fairly sure that my brain wasn’t the one at the controls at the moment. It had been nearly two weeks since I’d had anyone in my bed, and while I’d been used to *much* less frequent feminine attention back on Earth, I’d grown used to it here on Elardia. It wasn’t as if she were unwilling either, hell, she’d come looking for me.

*She came looking for me? Oh... oh fuck.*

The sudden return to reality was like a pane of glass shattering, unfortunately, it seemed as if she’d recognized it too.

The chair fell back as I tried to push myself away from her, and my hand came up, already halfway through the gesture for Solar Pulse.

I was too slow though, much too slow, and much too weak. Hell, I’d have been too slow and too weak if she’d been nothing more than an elf, but she wasn’t an elf.

She followed me down as the chair toppled backwards, wrapping her legs around my hips, and pinning my arms to the floor with her super-elven strength. She opened her jaws wide, revealing glistening white fangs, before plunging them into my neck.



# Chapter 69

**Quinn**

The sudden return to reality was like a pane of glass shattering, unfortunately, it seemed as if she’d recognized it too.

The chair fell back as I tried to push myself away from her, and my hand came up, already halfway through the gesture for Solar Pulse.

I was too slow though, much too slow, and much too weak. Hell, I’d have been too slow and too weak if she’d been nothing more than an elf, but she wasn’t an elf.

She followed me down as the chair toppled backwards, wrapping her legs around my hips, and pinning my arms to the floor with her super-elven strength. She opened her jaws wide, revealing glistening white fangs, before plunging them into my neck.

She wrapped a hand around each of mine, and I felt something crack as her crushing grip forced my fingers into a fist. I could still speak to cast a spell, but most of what I knew required my hands to direct the spell in at least some capacity.

I thrashed around, trying to pull one of my hands loose, or even to just get one of my fingers uncurled. She was just too strong though, and with every second that passed I felt myself growing weaker and weaker.

That was the trouble with casting from enervation or vitality, I had plenty of both, but you didn’t just lose them by casting spells. I was hemorrhaging both, *heh, hemorrhaging,* and was quickly running out of time to come up with a solution.

*This is going to suck*

I shouted the incantation to Fire Bolt, and poured in what enervation I could spare. There was a flash of light from the corner of my eye and an *indescribable* pain as heat like the inside of a forge washed over me.

The vampire screeched and pulled back, clutching her hand that was now not much more than a smoking and blackened ruin of bone.

“KILL HIM!”

*Oh fuck, there’s more?*

I didn’t have a whole lot of time, even without her gnawing on my neck, I could feel my strength waning. There were still two big holes in my neck, and I could feel hot blood running down at an alarming rate.

I brought my good hand up, the other one I didn’t dare to look at, and fired a Solar Pulse directly into her chest. I couldn’t afford to put much power into it, but then, I didn’t need to. The rapid pulses of pure sunlight bored a hole right through her chest, and she fell limp to the floor.

I heard running feet and the clatter of furniture as I pushed her body off of mine and got to my feet. Even the strain of standing almost put me right back on my ass, and I had to lean against the bookshelf for a precious second while my vision stopped swimming.

I was brought back to reality by a book landing on my head, and I looked up to see several more cascading down. One of the freakish creatures was climbing over to get at me, and I looked back to the entrance to the little study area to see three more come pelting around the corner.

If not for the inch long fangs and the too wild eyes that made it look as if they were on something, they might have been mistaken for normal students.

*Oh fuck, Mage vampires? Nope. Nope nope nope.*

“*GOODBYE*” I shouted, as I finished the gesture that would cast Teleport.

-----

Even with the large manastone I normally used for enchanting, I didn’t get far. The main limitation was how long I had to concentrate on the spell ahead of time, and since that was less than a second, the distance I could cover was measured in metres instead of kilometres. It was a lot of metres, I was dumping nearly ten mana into the spell after all, but that could only do so much.

I’d been aiming for the lobby, for one of the balconies that ringed the large open space that served alternatively as either a display area for more interesting pieces in the Library’s collection, or as a place for events to be held.

Unfortunately, my aim was just a *little*off. I came out at the right height for the balcony, but I was about a metre to the side. Rather than reappear on the balcony, I snapped back into reality in the open space over the stairs.

I landed on my feet, but landed hard, stumbled, and then tumbled forwards. I kept my crippled hand tucked into my body as I felt, and tried my best to keep my head from knocking against anything too hard with the other.

I clattered to a stop at the bottom of the stairs, aching everywhere. If the wounds on my neck or hands were notable, it was only in that they hurt *slightly more* than everything else. I caught a glimpse of my blackened left hand as I tried to right myself, I’d landed face down with my feet up on the stairs behind me, and almost retched. I tore my gaze away as quickly as I could, and focused on my manastone ring.

Not the one that bore the stone I’d used for the teleport, no, this was the one I’d gotten all those months ago back in Colos. It only had a couple of mana to provide, but if I tapped too much more from enervation I was likely to pass out, and it wasn’t as if I could use vitality to heal my own wounds. I was still fumbling about mentally, trying to tap the ring and cast the stupid spell when I heard heavy running footsteps thump against the solid floor of the foyer.

I looked up, thrusting my good, *or at least less crippled,* hand towards the noise, and I realized that I’d gone mostly blind. I’d lost my glasses in the fall, and with the loss of blood my vision had gone grey and shrunk down to a tiny point.

I cast Solar Pulse blindly, once, twice, three times, but didn’t hear the thud of a body hit the floor.

Instead, there was Nothus’s irritated voice, “Quinn! It’s me, sarding fext,” I felt her take me by the shoulders, propping me up as I nearly keeled over, “Oh Halaosil, you are a sarding mess. Now hold still.”

And then, the pain was gone.

The dark grey cast that my vision had taken was a little slower in receding, but at least it was clearing. I looked back down at my hands to find the left no longer charred, and the right no longer broken.

“Quinn?” Nothus asked insistently.

“Vampires,” I said, “At least four, maybe five, though I’m pretty sure I killed that one.”

I looked back up the stairs I’d fallen down, straining to listen, “I don’t know if they’re feeling like a round two,” I turned back to her, and swept a hand across the hall, “Where the hell is everyone?”

“It’s nearly midnight Quinn, everyone’s gone to bed! If I hadn’t-” she was interrupted by a screeching from up above, “Sard, I guess they’d like another shot at you.”

“Come on, away from the balcony, I don’t want one jumping down at us,” I said, as I backed towards the centre of the room, keeping Nothus behind me.

“That’s very sweet,” she said, stepping around me, “But I think that it’s probably best if I take point. You’re feeling better now Quinn, but you didn’t get much enervation back. Let me do the heavy lifting, and just focus on the ones that get behind me.”

“Alright,” I nodded, *sometimes discretion is the better part of valour and all that,* “Shouldn’t we have set off some alarms by now though? Can we expect any backup?”

She cast Apportion and a sturdy wooden chair from one tables on the wall flew towards her, “Probably not,” she said, as she caught it, “You probably set something off, assuming you killed that first one with magic, but all that’s going to do is tell whoever’s still here to hunker down. The University Guard is going to show up, but they’re not going to be here for several minutes,” she finished, as she started tearing the chair apart.

“Better than nothing I suppo-- Oh, here we go!” I shouted, as the four remaining vampires came sprinting down the hall above.

They didn’t even bother with the stairs, and instead simply threw themselves at us from the top of the wide staircase.

Nothus was ready for them, and when she threw one of her impromptu stakes, it flew with incredible accuracy to slam right through the chest of the lead vampire.

The four of them landed right in front of her, three lightly on their feet, and one in a bloody heap. Nothus roared, so loudly and deeply that I felt it resonate in my chest, and whipped another bit of chair forwards.

The vampires were fast, and this time her target managed to dodge just enough to take the projectile in the shoulder instead of the heart. The creature screeched as its shoulder was crushed by the force of the impact, but it still rushed Nothus with the rest of its kin.

Nothus seized the injured one in both hands as it leapt for her throat, all but ignoring the other two as they latched on and dug their fangs into her shoulder and side. The injured vampire struggled in her grasp and raked at her face, but Nothus was unfazed. With one of her feet she kicked at the ruins of the chair that she’d left on the floor, knocking it around until one of the wooden crossbars was left sticking straight up.

Nothus lifted the wriggling creature high over her head, and then *slammed* it down hard enough that the floor tiles cracked. The shaft was driven into its back and came out the other side in an explosion of blood and shards of bone.

I blasted the nearer of the two vampires, the one trying to bite through her side, with Solar Pulse, and it fell headless to the floor.

Nothus swatted the last of the vampires, tearing its fangs free of her shoulder, in the way that I might brush off an annoying insect, and it fell to the ground. It recovered quickly, twisting and darting to bite Nothus’s ankle, but she planted one large foot on its chest to pin it in place.

It screamed and thrashed, and tore at her leg with its fingers, but it didn’t do much. It had fangs, not claws, and Nothus had apparently taken most of my bio-engineering advice. It didn’t do much more than tear her clothing.

Nothus reached down, taking the creature’s head in both hands, and *pulled*

*OH FOR FUCKS SAKE*

The vampire’s head came free with a sickening tearing sound, and an immense amount of blood came spewing out of the vampire’s ragged stump of a neck.

Nothus dropped the head, and turned to face me. The horrified look in her eyes was all I needed to know that she sensed what I was feeling. I turned away, and sat down heavily on the ground, while I waited for the Guard to get here.

----

We were asked a great deal of questions in the hours or so that followed the fight, but I was relieved to learn that Diova’s team was safe. They too had faced an attack like mine, and while they’d had to contend with nearly twenty of the creatures, they’d been in the Patrician guild hall at the time.

“What, are vampires suicidal?” I asked, “They must have known, I mean, that place is a fortress, in the truest sense of the word.”

“They were all thralls, we only found one true vampire, and that was the one you killed upstairs,” Lili explained, “And even she was just a lieutenant, not much more than a thrall with a bit more independence.”

“So you’re telling me that there’s some vampire Big Bad Evil Guy out there that’s still got a bone to pick with me?” I asked, far too tired to rise from my seat on the floor.

She nodded, “Publishing Solar Pulse might be enough to get the Lord off your back, or they might hold a grudge. It’s hard to say.”

“Fantastic,” I sighed, “It’s probably organized enough now that a Mage would be able to learn it, even if they weren’t involved in the creation. I can give you the papers when we get back to the clubhouse. Different question, am I going to get all thrallified now?”

“Thrallified?” Lili asked, raising a delicate eyebrow.

“Turned into a thrall,” I clarified.

She shook her head, causing her gold hair to ripple and shimmer, “If it were as simple as getting bitten then there’d be more vampires than people pretty quickly. No, she’d need to kill you with her bite to turn you.”

“Well that’s some sort of consolation,” I said moving to stand, “Now let’s get the hell out of here.”

“Alright,” she said, “Do you need a hand up?”

“I’ll manage,” I said, getting unsteadily to my feet, “Just need to talk to Nothus before we leave.”

“I don’t know about that,” Lili said, tiling her head to look past me, “It looks as if she’s busy.”

I turned to see Nothus sitting at a table on the far side of the room, head propped up on one fist, and clearly quite bored. She had three guardsmen, officers I think, or the medieval equivalent to detectives, standing around her. I’d say it was an interrogation, but Nothus did not seem to be in the mood to cooperate. She just stared blankly ahead as they asked question after question.

“Why aren't they giving me a hard time?” I asked Lili quietly.

“Your robes make it quite clear that you’re not to be bothered,” she explained under her breath, “And more than that, as you might have noticed, Nothus is not well liked.”

I nodded, thinking for a moment, before striding towards the little group.

---

One of the men looked up as I approached, and held out a hand, “Excuse me your lordship, we’re not quite done here.”

“Really?” Nothus asked, “Because you slack-jawed idiots ran out of questions to ask an hour ago.”

“Perhaps if you’d cooperate-” began one of the men.

“I did sarding cooperate,” Nothus growled, obviously running out of patience, “I answered all of your questions already, twice even!”

“We just want to ensure that we have all of the facts,” explained the man who’d first spoken, “It’s very important that-”

“Alright,” I cut in, “Go away.”

“Pardon me your lordship?” The man asked.

“Go away,” I repeated, “You’re done here.”

“Excuse me your lordship but-”

“Are there any questions she hasn’t answered?” I asked, and he opened his mouth to speak, but I interrupted him again, “I don’t care if she didn’t answer them the fifth time, did she answer them the first time?”

“Yes,” Nothus growled.

The man, *detective?* sighed, “Yes.”

“Then go away. She saved my life, and now you’re giving her a hard fucking time for it,” I said tiredly, “Away away away.”

He raised his hands in surrender, and left with his subordinates in tow.

“Thanks Quinn,” Nothus said once they were out of earshot.

“You’re welcome,” I said, and then smiled, “Do I need to say it?”

She smiled as well, “No, I know it.”

I nodded, “Good.”

“And we’re...?” she asked.

“Friends?” I guessed, “Are you referring to the whole manual decapitation thing?”

“Yeah,” she nodded, grimacing a little, “Sorry about that.”

I let out a dark chuckle, “It was certainly effective. Maybe in the future though...”

“I’ll try,” she nodded, “We’re good though?”

“Yes, whatever my initial reactions were, it’s not as if what I did with Solar Pulse was much different. Though it was a lot less messy. Are you going to need somewhere safe to stay tonight?” I asked, changing the subject, “Wandering around in the middle of the night doesn’t seem like the best idea right now.”

“If I wasn’t wandering around in the middle of the night then I’d never have known that you were in trouble in the first place,” she retorted, “Besides, I can take care of myself Quinn,” she insisted, nodding towards the mess that was still being cleaned up.

“I won’t argue with that Nothus. But if you change your mind, you know where to find me. Good night.”

“Good night Quinn.”

----

Lili got me safely back to the clubhouse, though in this case the major danger came from the risk that I might pass out along the way, and not from vampires.

My clubmates were still awake when I arrived, because, of course they were. They all rushed in the moment I stepped inside, crowding around, and each of them with some salient comment to make.

“What were you doing in the Library in the middle of the night?” Kennocha hissed.

“I heard that Nothus killed a bunch of vampires, is she a slayer now? Ohmygod, ohmygod, ohmygod, do you have Buffy on your phone? She would like, totally love that,” Brandy said, jumping up and down with excitement.

“I’m glad you’re alright,” Victorina said seriously.

“We’ve got to get that Solar Pulse worked into a light enchantment,” Neferoy said gruffly, “Now that would be one fext of a talisman against more of the awful freaks.”

“Is all of that blood yours?” Minki asked, her wide eyes staring at my chest.

I looked down to see that there was really a surprising amount of dried blood caking my neck and the front of my robes.

*Fuck, I’m a mess.*

“Alright,” Halea said, “Give him some space, can’t you see that he’s even paler than usual? He’ll pass out if he doesn’t get some air. Come on now,” she continued, slipping forwards and taking my arm, “Let’s get you washed up and put to bed.”

I spared a glance for Victorina as Halea pulled me away. The two of us were well and truly done with each other, and it had been a month, but I couldn’t help but consider how she might be hurt by this. She met my gaze as I looked back and gave me a small sad smile, and a tilt of the head.

*So that’s what that’s like.*



# Chapter 70

**Quinn**

---

*Ohhh... oh my, now this is one hell of a way to wake up.*

I lifted my head up slightly to see that, yes, there was a roughly Halea sized lump moving around under the covers. My head fell fell back to the pillow, and I let out a long sigh. It was very quiet in my bedroom, the only noise being the soft, wet, sounds that escaped from underneath the sheets. I was dimly aware that it was late in the morning, or maybe early afternoon, but I tried to avoid thinking too much, and just let myself relax.

Halea was clearly quite good at what she was doing, which I did not at all consider a bad thing, and was able to draw things out for ages, until I finally couldn’t take it anymore. She poked her head out from underneath the covers a minute or so later, after more soft, wet, sounds.

“Feeling better?” she teased, as she tucked herself in under my arm.

“Yeah,” I muttered lethargically.

“Hey!” she said, slapping my side, “Don’t you fall back to sleep, it’s nearly noon. Especially not after I went to all that trouble to wake you up.”

“Is that what you were doing?” I laughed, a little more clear headed.

“Yes,” she said primly.

“Well, I’m certainly not going to complain.”

“So,” she said in a dusky voice, “You’d want more then?”

“What, now?” I asked incredulously.

“I thought humans were supposed to have incredible endurance, are you telling me that’s not true?” she teased.

“Well half an hour of your nibbling has left me just a little bit tender down there.”

“I’m only teasing,” she admitted, “No, I was thinking about later.”

“Oh?”

“Mmm hmm, after all, you do need some help with battle magic, at least if last night was any indication.”

“Where exactly is this going?” I asked, looking at her out of the corner of my eye.

“It could be a little competition. I tutor you, we spar a little, and each time you win...” she trailed off, tracing her fingers down my abdomen.

“That’s an interesting sort of incentive system you’re setting up there.”

“However, if *I* win,” she whispered, reaching up and taking a firm hold of my hair, “Well,” she grinned, “You get the idea.”

“Now that hardly seems fair,” I protested, “I won’t even have a chance. This sounds like a not so complicated ploy to get me down on my knees.”

“And?”

“Now I’m not afraid of a little reciprocation,” I told her, “But I’ve got to have a fighting chance at least.”

“Oh fine,” she said petulantly, “I’ll come up with something else. But whatever it is, you can bet that there’s going to be a whole bunch of oral sarding going on.”

----

I had a few days to rest after my encounter with the vampires, and spent most of the time relaxing and sorting out my mana problems.

Nothus had been onto something when she’d mentioned elf sacrifice, but not in the way that either of us had thought.

No, I wasn’t about to go around killing people to supply the mana I’d need, but it had given me an idea. Rather than sacrifice a person, I’d come up with the idea of sacrificing an animal instead. Maybe a lot of animals. I wasn’t going to get soul from anything non-sentient, but the vitality could add up pretty quickly. I’d even recovered a book on blood magic from the Forbidden Tower that I’d be able to refer to. ‘The Qualities of Bloodstone’ had been part of the Necromancy collection I’d copied down, and I recalled from my brief flip through it that it had referred to spells such as Drain Vitality and Drain Enervation.

Unfortunately, it didn’t quite hold the answers that I wanted. Animal sacrifice was certainly a solution, but not a very effective one. An animal as large as an ox for example would have as much as *three hundred* total energy when you accounted for both vitality and enervation, and while that sounded like exactly the answer I was looking for, I was disappointed upon reading further.

With the notable exception of spells that had an affinity to specific animals, a caster would rarely get more than a fraction of the animal’s total enervation and vitality. In my case, that fraction was likely one in fifty.

*Which makes sense, I guess. Otherwise cattle farmers would be making bank by selling their herds to the University.*

The book did hold the answers that I *needed* though, at least, for some definitions of ‘need.’ The solution of course was the titular ‘Bloodstone’. It was like a manastone, but rather than draw from ambient mana to recharge itself, the bloodstone was filled by making living sacrifices. It wasn’t even that hard to make one, just a drop of the enchanter’s blood and the life of a goat, lamb, or stag.

*And no capacity limit either. Damn.*

Once made, it was just one big battery for naughty magic. Theoretically, the bloodstone could save me from the logistical nightmare that would be the simultaneous sacrifice of the fifty oxen it would take to make the spellstone. I could do it one by one, charging as I went, but that was not what caught my eye. What caught my eye was the passage that mentioned that the ‘sacrifice’ need not necessarily die in the process of charging the bloodstone.

To feed vitality into the stone, I would need to kill whatever I was sacrificing, but not in the case of soul.

*And again I come back to soul.*

I’d known from the very beginning that soul was an option, but had been reluctant to do if for one simple reason. The spell stone was three hundred mana, and I had to work in units of a thousand. I could burn a year of my life to make the spellstone, but then that extra seven hundred mana would be wasted.

*With the bloodstone though...*

It wouldn’t be hard either, in fact, it was no different than when I’d opened myself up to Nothus for her to heal Minki. No complex ritual, no big mess, just a thought and the stone would be charged.

*Can I afford to lose another year? I think so. I’m functionally immortal, so it’s not like I’m going to lose soul any other way than spending it like this. Yeah, especially if I’ll still have the other seven hundred to spend later, I think this makes it worth the price.*

Next Fextday, a week from today, I’d go out early in the morning. I’d track down a stag somewhere in my future demesne, hogtie it with Apportation, and then sacrifice the thing. I’d be able to burn away any evidence of the blood magic, and bury or dump the body. Get back to the clubhouse, make the spellstone, and then head back to the guildhall. If all went according to plan, I might even be able to do the whole thing that same day, assuming I could find a stag without too much trouble.

*After all, what could possibly go wrong?*

---

I was given the chance on the following Louday morning to sign up for the team sparring matches in the Arena with the rest of my class, and did so. I’d originally planned to skip it, mostly because I thought that I hadn’t needed the practice, but my encounter with the vampires had been proof that I’d been mistaken. That ambush, a couple months ago now, had inflated my ego a little. I’d thought at the time that it had been a pretty good indication of how far my abilities had come, but that had been foolish of me. The vampire hadn’t even used any magic, aside from maybe a little light compulsion, and she was still more than capable of killing me.

I’d gotten out of that alive only through sheer luck, and with Nothus’s help. I did not intend for that to happen again.

Of course, I was selected to lead one of the four teams. Was it because I had some special insight into leading mages into battle? Was it in deference to that ambush I’d fought off with Victorina? No, of course not. It was because I’d convinced everyone that I had imperial blood.

The selection method the professor used was only made more clear when I considered the other teams. The other three team captains weren’t Imperial or Royal, but that was only because we had no other Imperial or Royal students in the class. Instead, two were Duke’s sons, and one was the son of a Marquis. Were there more skilled Mages, or more tactically minded leaders? Oh, probably, but silly things like merit didn’t matter.

“Quinn, in deference to your rank, you’ll be allowed to make the first choice of teammates,” the professor said, and I was reminded of the way that teams were picked for sports in highschool, “It’ll be teams of four, including yourself, so choose accordingly.”

“Four?” I asked, “Shouldn’t it be closer to six? We’ve got about twenty four students now that the other three classes have joined us.”

One of the ducal heirs, whose name I still hadn’t wasted the time to learn, piped up, “I would have thought that after all that time spent under Victorina’s heel, you might appreciate the chance to make your own choices,” he shook his head with exaggerated sadness, “I guess we know now why it is human woman are so used to wearing trousers.”

“I take it from your *incredibly* insightful remark, that the women aren't usually invited?” I asked, turning to look at the short pudgy Mage in shimmering gold robes.

“No, why, you want some skirts to hide behind?” he replied.

“Oh go sard yourself Olar,” one of the girls shouted from the back.

“That one!” I said pointing in the general direction of the shout, “She’s my first pick for my team.”

Olar opened his mouth, likely to say something offensive, but he was cut off by the professor, “Alright, that’s enough. And Quinn,” he said, looking to me, “You can’t force anyone to join your team, and I just want you to be aware that selecting Isal for your team might limit who else is willing to join.”

I didn’t respond, and instead took a moment to consider my classmates, looking at each one in turn. I won’t pretend that I terrified them with my intense stare, causing them to avert their eyes in terror, but more than a few of my classmates seemed a little nervous. Granted, about twice as many were looking at me with naked contempt, but they could get fucked. There was one face that stood out in the crowd though, and it took a monumental effort not to jump up in my seat when I noticed her.

Sila was sitting near the back of the classroom by the door, she’d evidently come in with one of the other classes, and she positively lit up the moment she saw me looking at her.

*Five women, not even half of one class, let alone four classes, but they’re the ones who bothered to show up. Even if one of them is Sila, they’re either damn good, or damn stubborn. Yeah, I think I can do this.*

“Don’t care, go ahead and make your pick Olar.”

----

We were dismissed from class early so that each of us had time to hash things out with our new team mates. Make introductions, talk tactics, and the like. In the interests of finding somewhere quiet to talk, and also because I hadn’t eaten yet today, I took my new team of followers out for a late brunch at the usual cafe.

This was quite a step up in the world for most of the team, since only Isal had been born into any particular privilege. The rest, Nina, Setisi, Myli, and Sila, were all women of low birth. In fact, as the daughter of a tavern owner, Sila might have been somewhere above average in our little group.

Isal, a rather pretty blonde city elf, was the daughter of a Count and wore the crimson robes to match. Her sharp features, small mouth, and generally sour expression did make her seem perpetually angry, but she was pleasant despite the initial impression.

*And she told off Olar, which is a big plus.*

Setisi was likely the most interesting one of the group, and was one of the few gnomes I’d had the pleasure of meeting so far. She shared Djeta’s reddish brown colouring, and I was reminded again of the colour of the soil on Prince Edward Island. Her hair too was red, or rather, orange, and was cut quite short.

*Pixie cut? Or I guess, this is a gnome cut?*

Nina and Myli were also city elves, but not ones of great means, as far as I could tell. They had their bursaries, or at least I was pretty sure they did, but seemed to follow Sila’s initial strategy of thriftiness. They both spent the money on well cut robes of quality cloth, but had not wasted a single drachm on any flash or fancy dyes.

And then there was Sila, who was so excited that she looked like she was about to burst. I’d been half expecting her to faint the moment I called her name to join my team, and if she’d been standing at the time, she might very well have done so.

She’d clearly had some work done, but thankfully she’d not taken it as far as Diova had with Mata. The changes were subtle, but noticeable. Her smile, previously crooked and slightly off-white was now perfect and pearly white. Her hair, which had always been in fairly good shape for a village girl, was now perfect. It had a healthy luster to it, and the odd split end had been touched up. Her skin which had always been a little rough and weather-worn, particularly around the hands, was now flawless, and a great deal more pale. Oh, and now she had breasts. Not too huge, she was still plausibly proportioned for a sixteen or seventeen year old elf, but the increase had been more than puberty would be able to account for.

*At least she hasn’t thrown herself at me yet. But the second we’re alone...*

“Are we supposed to come up with a team name?” Nina asked a little tentatively, as she looked between Isal and myself.

“And a colour,” Isal nodded.

“We could do blue!” Sila said, positively bubbling, “Quinn really likes blue.”

Isal raised an eyebrow, “You two know each other?”

“Yes,” Sila said cheerfully.

”Kinda,” I said, less cheerfully, at the same time.

Isal’s eyebrow somehow managed to creep further up her forehead, but did not comment, “Blue then?” she asked.

This was followed by a round of nods from the other women at the table, but I shook my head, “I had something different in mind. Olar and the others are already going to be giving us a hard time since I put together a team of girls, and I think we should play to that.”

“What, pick something that seems more manly?” Isal asked.

“No,” I grinned, “Very much the opposite.”

“Pink!” she declared.

“As bright a pink as is possible,” I agreed, “We shall strain the limits of elven technology to find a pink that is girly enough.”

“And you’re okay with that?” Isal asked, “I mean, you’re going to be wearing the uniform too, you’re not concerned that Olar is going to make some remark about your, um, preferences?”

“Preferences? He’s the one that’s terrified at the thought of a woman coming within ten feet of his little testosterone party. Whose preferences are in doubt here exactly?”

Isal smirked, “That’s a good point I suppose. What about a team name then?” Isal asked, “Do we also want something suitably ‘girly’?”

“Super happy flower party!” Myli cheered, and judging from her voice, I was pretty sure that she was at least a couple years younger than Sila.

I shrugged and glanced at Isal, who just shook her head and laughed.

“Alright,” I said, “Super happy flower party it is. Now, let’s talk a bit about tactics.”

---

The group split up a couple hours later, after we’d sorted out some basic tactical doctrine, and gotten an idea of what each of us was able to do.

Sila, of course, followed about a step behind as I left the cafe.

“Do you want to go somewhere to sit down Quinn?” Sila asked.

“We were just sitting down in the cafe back there,” I pointed out obtusely.

“I know,” Sila said softly, “But there was everyone else there with us.”

“Sila...” I began.

She grabbed my arm roughly, pulling me around to face her, and I was reminded then of how much stronger elves tended to be. She clenched her jaw, and met my gaze with an angry expression in her eyes.

“We *need* to talk,” she demanded, “You can’t just keep running away from everything.”

“Let go of my arm,” I commanded, without raising my voice.

She did, pulling her hand away as if she’d just been burned, but her steady gaze did not waver.

“Come on,” I said finally, “I was going to the Library anyway.”

---

I found a quiet place, much like the little alcove I’d been working in before I was ambushed by the vampire, though this one had a window in the exterior wall. I sat down, the cold sunlight of mid-autumn streaming through the window to light the room, and indicated the chair across from me.

“What is it Sila?” I asked, as she made herself comfortable.

“Just a moment,” she said, before taking something out of her belt. A belt actually, that was identical to mine. It was a short wand, about a foot long, and she waved it about the small alcove and across the two of us before finally putting it back into it’s pouch.

“Alright,” she said finally, “It’s safe, she’s not listening.”

I raised an eyebrow at that, “Who?”

“Victorina,” she said through gritted teeth, leaning forwards, “I think I can get you away from her.”

“Sila,” I sighed, “I don’t need-”

“She raped you,” she hissed, totally derailing my train of thought, “She raped you, she’s a rapist, and if she doesn’t let you go, I’m going to kill her.”

*You know, I thought that this whole conversation was going to be a mess. But this is something else entirely.*

“Sila, I understand why you might take issue with Victorina and I sleeping together, but that’s my choice to make,” I told her, “And I did make that choice, Victorina didn’t force anything on me.”

“You don’t need to pretend with me Quinn,” Sila said pleadingly, “Not everyone can be strong all the time. I saw Quinn, you don’t need to pretend, I even tried to help then, but... I just wasn’t ready.”

“You saw?” I asked flatly, “So that night someone took a shot at Victorina and I-”

“Just Victorina,” Sila said, slamming her fist down on the arm of the chair, “I saw what she was doing to you, and you were all tied up, oh gods,” she quavered, “And I couldn’t stop her, not for good,” then her voice grew stronger, “But I can now. You don’t need to do anything Quinn,” she promised, “Just come away with me. I have a big place out in the countryside, just come away with me. You’ll be safe there while I deal with her. Please,” she pleaded, “You don’t need to let her hurt you.”

*For fuck’s sake, how am I supposed to explain some light kinky fun to an innocent little village girl?*

“I swear Quinn,” she promised, after I’d been quiet for a moment, still trying to figure out what the hell to say, “I’ll protect you. Just tonight, you come and stay with me, instead of going back to her.”

“I don’t ‘go back to her’,” I said finally, “Not any more. We broke up, nearly a month ago now.”

“That’s great!” Sila said, hopping up to a crouch in her chair, “Now just-”

“And whatever you might have seen, it obviously wasn’t what you thought it was. The how and why of us separating isn’t important, but what is important, is that Victorina and I are still friends. And if you try to kill my friend,” I said through gritted teeth, “You had better be ready for the fucking consequences.”

Sila went a little pale, and leaned back in her chair, “I’m sorry Quinn,” she whispered, “But what I saw-”

“Sometimes,” I said tiredly, “I’m *in charge*, and sometimes she gets to be *in charge.* That time, she was *in charge.*”

“So, she didn’t...”

“No,” I said simply.

“And, you wanted her to do it?” she asked.

“Yes,” I nodded.

And then she started crying.

---

I got to my spell invention class a little late, extricating myself from the mess with Sila had taken longer than I’d realized, and I’d gone for a bit of a walk afterwards to clear my head.

*She’s cute, especially now, and I enjoy her company. If she were a year or two older I’d be happy to have the same sort of friends with benefits arrangement with her, as I do with Halea. But even if she was a couple years older, I was pretty sure that she wasn’t going to settle for that. She wanted more, and if I only gave her what I was willing to and then not one thing further, she’d be left feeling used.*

“Quinn, you’re looking well for someone who was nearly eaten by a vampire,” Diova said, as I sat down heavily across from him.

I shrugged, “Been eating a lot of red meat, I’ll be back at full strength in a few more days.”

“Red meat?” He asked.

“For the iron, to replace all the blood I lost. Nothus didn’t have the mana to create five or six more pints of blood, so I’ve got to put it all back the hard way.”

“There is iron in red meat?” Baron Bronippo asked.

“And it helps create blood?” Tosa wondered.

“Maybe elves are different,” I said, trying to change the subject, explaining what hemoglobin were and how they worked would take all day, “How are we on Solar Pulse?”

“All but done,” Diova explained, “With you present we’ll have it done today, tomorrow at the latest.”

“Good, hopefully once we’ve got everything sorted and people start learning it vampires will be discouraged from doing any more evil shit anywhere near the University,” I said tiredly.

It was only a little past noon, but already I felt exhausted. Five or six pints might have been an exaggeration, but only just. If I’d been back on Earth I’d probably have been given a blood transfusion, but that wasn’t really an option here. I was AB positive, which meant that theoretically any human was a valid donor, but I had no clue how to do it safely.

*And Brandy will probably object if I start sticking her with needles while I experiment with different methods.*

It did make one thing clear though, I was in no state to go after the wraith. Not drained, *get it?* like this. My body was whole, but I was still certain that the missing blood was capping my enervation and vitality below their normal maximum, which would account for how tired I was feeling. I could get the bloodstone and spellstone prepared, but actually running off to deal with the wraith would need to wait.

We made quite a bit of headway though, and I was reminded of projects I’d worked on back at U of T. Designing a spell wasn’t quite the same as writing code, but I saw significant similarities. The way we could take existing spells for one, and make them do new things, and how that was so much faster than developing a brand new spell out of whole cloth. The tweak to turn Poltergeist into Magic Missile for example, that had taken Minki and I little more than a week since the changes had been simple. Solar Pulse was quite a bit longer, partially because of the increased complexity of the change, and partially because we were only working on it for a few hours two days a week.

Even with the increased complexity though, we’d been able to draw from other spells for much of it. We probably spent more time picking the particular type of Mirror spell to draw from, than we did fitting into Solar Pulse.

Teaching it too was very much like coding. When you were the one to write it, whether it was code or a spell, it would often be the case that you could understand the structure of what you’d created, but if someone came in cold they’d have no damned clue as to what was going on. Solar Pulse had been like that when we’d first got it into a state where we could actually cast it and have it work. The trouble then was making sure that everyone else would eventually be able to learn it, and that’s what we spent the afternoon on. We didn’t quite have it done by five o’clock, but Diova was right, another afternoon like that and we’d all be able to relax.

“Quinn,” Diova said quietly, he’d stayed behind while the others filed out at the end of the class, “In your state... do you need a hand getting back to your clubhouse?”

“I’ll live,” I told him, “Though I appreciate the concern.”

“Are you certain?” he asked, “The vampires were willing to risk assaulting our guildhall directly, if they fear our creation that much they might try again. Night has already fallen, and excuse me for saying so, but you look deathly pale. Even more so than usual.”

I rolled my eyes at the last comment, and told him, “Halea’s going to teleport over and pick me up, I’ll be fine.”

He leaned back, “Good, good. Just don’t work yourself to death. I would not have held it against you if you’d requested we join you in your own clubhouse to get this finished.”

“Hmm, well that’s not a terrible idea actually. But I’m pretty sure Victorina would not be a fan. It's fine Diova, I can get Halea to play taxi.”

“How you ever managed to get a Ducal princess to play servant for you I’ll never understand,” he said with a shake of his head, as he stood to leave.

---

“Hey, wake up you big dolt,” Halea said, as she shook me gently awake, “Pretty sure that last time you let yourself fall asleep like this it did not go well. Come on, wake up.”

“I’m up, I’m up,” I protested, pushing my glasses up my face and rubbing at my eyes.

She helped me up, and steadied me when I risked teetering right over, “Whoa there Quinn, are you alright?”

“No, I got bitten by a vampire and she drank all my blood,” I said wryly, “Just get me back to the clubhouse so I can lay the hell down.”

“Mmm, sounds good to me,” she smouldered.

# Chapter 71

**Quinn**

---

The following day’s battlemagic class was waived in favour of letting the teams prepare for the coming melees, and we made sure to take full advantage. The rules had been set out in such a way that only magical skill and tactical aptitude were going to matter. We’d all be wearing robes made specifically for the arena, which meant that unlike the standard tournaments, we’d all be on level ground when it came to armouring or defensive enchantments. It was the same with any sort of enchanted item actually, we either couldn’t bring them at all, or if we did, as was the case with Mages who used staves or wands, they would be ones issued by the professors. Which meant that we needed to have a damn good idea of just how we were going to approach this whole mess.

“There’s four teams, including ours, so... What, each team fights three matches, and whoever wins the most is the best team?” I asked.

We’d met in the Library this time, at the top of one of its many towers. It was the same tower I’d stood in while planning my break in to the Forbidden Tower actually, and I couldn’t help but glance across to it every now and then. The space was bare, other than the furniture we sat in, and there was little cover for those that might try to overhear us. Countering magical observation was left to Isal and Setisi.

“Basically,” Isal confirmed, “Though there might also be a tiebreaker if it’s necessary.”

“Why don’t you just teach us all Magic Missile?” Myli, the one that made Sila seem mature, asked, “Then we could beat them really easy, just like how Halea won the tournament!”

I shook my head, “Not an option, I have an agreement with another party at the University. I sold the rights, with the condition that neither of us distribute it for an entire year.”

“Oh,” Myli said sadly.

“Besides all six of us throwing the same spell over and over, no matter how powerful it is, is not a good strategy. Magic Missile is amazing, but it has its limits, and someone could still get the drop on you. No, we need to be playing to our strengths and covering each other's weaknesses.”

“Why don’t we go around the room then?” Setisi, the little red brown gnome, asked, “And each of us says a little bit about what we can do well, and what we need some help with.”

“The human can go first,” Isal said, prodding me under the table with her foot.

I raised an eyebrow, but did as I was bade, “I’m good at dealing out damage, especially at very long range, but I’m not great at defensive magic. I mean, I *know* the spells, but that doesn’t really mean a whole lot. I can cast a shield if I need too I guess.”

“Didn’t you kill all those kidnappers?” Nina asked.

“Sure,” I shrugged, “But they were shooting at me with bows, and my robes were enchanted. It wasn’t much of a contest, but even then, I went down the first time they managed to hit me somewhere the robes didn’t cover.”

“Well I might be able to keep you covered there,” Isal provided, “I’m not much good at offence, it’s like you said, I know the spells but it doesn’t mean much. Defensive magic I can do though.”

“I’m okay at both kinda, I guess,” Nina hedged, “I like Jet spells though, I don’t know about the other stuff though. My best might only be as good as your worst,” she finished, nodding towards Isal and I.

“Hmmm, I think we can work with that,” I mused, as a plan started to form.

“I’m where Nina is basically,” Setisi said, “The two of us have been working on Jets a lot, so that’s about all we’ve got for fighting magic. I am pretty good with illusions though.”

“I don’t know,” Myli said hesitantly, when it became her turn, “I don’t think I’ve really got any strengths, I’m only really here because Isal made me come.”

“*Myli*,” Isal groaned.

“It’s fine,” I assured them, “We can work with it. What about you Sila?” I asked, looking at Sila, who had not spoken this whole time.

She’d spent our entire conversation sitting as far from me as possible, and staring at the surface of the table the whole time.

“Sila?” Isal prompted, after Sila didn’t respond.

“Fine,” Sila sighed, “I can cast defensive magic well enough to protect myself really well, or myself and one other person. I can’t do Jets like you two can,” she nodded at the others, “But I’m much better when I can keep my distance or surprise someone.”

*I wonder what you could do with a skill set like that?*

“Well, is the big strong man going to tell us all what to do?” Isal asked, giving me a knowing look, “Oh spit it out,” she demanded, after I cocked an eyebrow at her.

“It’s a simple plan,” I explained, “Isal and I stay in the centre, and she shields everyone-”

“Everyone?” Isal asked, surprised, “I haven’t got that kind of mana, Quinn, not if you want the shield to last more than thirty seconds.”

“You don’t need to worry about that,” I said, shaking my head, “I’ll cover the energy costs, you just try to use it as efficiently as possible.”

“Oh...” Isal said thoughtfully, “That could work, damn, yeah, that could really work.”

“Same goes for Setisi,” I continued, “The rest of you would be arranged in a square around us, and Setisi would be one of the front corners. At the start of a fight she keeps us covered, and I keep her provided for mana. Not for too long I hope,” I said, glancing to her, “But I should be able to keep it up long enough for us to get into a good position while we’re still under cover of your illusions.”

Setisi nodded, “I can do that, you wouldn’t even need to provide all of the mana, just some of it and I’d be able to keep it up for several minutes at least.”

“Perfect,” I smiled, “Well once it starts your job would become much simpler. You and Nina, who would be covering the other front corner, would use those Jets to keep any of our opponents from getting in too close. Sila and Myli would cover the rear two corners, and between the three of us we’d deal with anyone out of range of your Jets.”

“Do you really think this can work?” Isal asked, “And you’re sure you can afford to give up that much mana? Are you even going to be able to cast Magic Missile while you’re playing mule for the rest of us?”

“Well hopefully we won’t have the illusion and the shield going at the same time,” I explained, “But yeah, I can do it, and still cast Magic Missile. To give you a frame of reference, almost every time you’ve seen it used in the Arena, it was being cast at a level I can do for free.”

“Oh,” Setisi breathed.

“Yeah,” I nodded, smirking a little, “And more than that, I have a hunch, and if I’m right, it’s going to win us our first match no matter how badly we mess up the plan.”

“That’s rather confident of you,” Isal said skeptically.

“Confident,” I agreed, “But not *over*confident, and for one simple reason. The others are all going to try to do the lone wolf thing. Our first match is going to be a series of six, six on one fights. *Maybe* six on two, if they managed to figure out what’s happening before we get to them all. It's only after that first fight that we’re even going to need to worry about locking horns with the whole enemy team at the same time.”

Isal tilted her head from side to side as she rubbed at her chin, “I don’t think that’s as sure a thing as you seem to think it is, but I do think you’re pretty close to the mark. It would be a safe bet to say that most plans the others will come up with will begin with ‘we all split up’. They’re probably going to rush off to try to get kills before their teammates ‘steal’ them. Fext, even after the first match, they might still try splitting up to fight us.”

“So we might win then?” Myli asked, almost jumping up and down with excitement.

“Yeah, I think we might,” Isal smiled.

---

It was quite a bit later, just as the sun had gone down on that same day, that I found myself alone with Mata. We’d finished and handed in Solar Pulse a little after lunch, and already it was being distributed throughout the University. By the same time next week every Mage in the University would have unfettered access to the greatest anti-vampire spell ever created.

*You’re welcome entire world.*

“Stop looking at me like that,” Mata demanded, though her hugely plump lips made it hard to understand her sometimes.

“Like what exactly?” I asked tiredly.

*I really hope I can recover a least a bit by next week, I’ll be no good if I’m always feeling this fatigued.*

“Like that,” she repeated, as best she could, “All the women look at me like I’m a sarding whore, and all the men look at me like they want to sard me stupid. But you look at me like I’m something to pity.”

I didn’t really have much to say in response to that, I mean, she was right. She might have been overstating the feelings of the other students, either in magnitude or volume, but she wasn’t wrong, not in essence.

I leaned back in the chair, and stared up at the ceiling, “Why?” I asked simply.

“Why’d I let Diova turn me into a doll he can dress up in pretty clothes?” she snapped.

“Yeah,” I said sadly.

I saw, out of the corner of my eye, as she turned her face away from me, “Because I don’t like dressing like the peasant that I am, because the money I get helps so many people back home, and because I love him.”

“***What?***” I exclaimed, snapping awake, and sitting bolt upright in the overstuffed armchair.

“Is it that hard to believe?” she asked, “Even before I got to the University and started sending my bursary back home, Diova would always send money to the village. And then, once I did get here he offered to let me join his club. I knew what he wanted from me, but living there was one less drachm I had to spend on housing, and one more drachm I could send home. And it’s not like I hated the idea,” she said, turning bright red, “He’s a prince, a *prince*, and he wanted me, even as I used to look. And the more I got to know him, and the more I spent time with him, the more...” she let out a long breath and hesitated before continuing, but did continue, “So when he asked me if I’d agree to take shape changing enchantments and potions, I said yes. He could have given those to anyone, but he gave them to me. If this is what ‘perfect’ looks like to him, then I’m happy to be *his* perfect.”

“And everyone else?” I asked.

“I don’t like it,” she said, “How they look at me, but it doesn’t matter, not really.”

*And I thought my love life was fucked up.*

# Chapter 72

**Quinn**

---

“For today’s lesson we’re going to cover something I’m sure most of you have been waiting for,” the professor explained as he set down a rather large bundle on his desk, “And that’s magical foci.”

This made even the regularly lazy students straighten a little in their seats, and the professor unwrapped the bundle to show a collection of wands and staves which ranged from six inches to five feet in length.

“We’ve spoken about these a little already, but it’s about time that everyone learns how to make one of these for themselves,” the professor continued, “Each of these is a ‘blank’ and you can pick any one you like to use as a base for your new wand or staff. You can also provide one of your own if you’d prefer something other than what I have here.”

“Does it need to be made of wood?” one of my classmates asked, “Or can we make it out of anything we like?”

“The majority of the focus must be organic,” the professor answered, “However you may add non-organic materials to it, such as metallic end caps, or mana stones.”

“What do you mean by majority?” I asked, “The majority by weight? Or is it by volume? Could I get a dagger proportioned in such a way that the wood and leather of the hilt is a large enough portion of the dagger to make the whole thing an acceptable focus, even with a metallic blade?”

The professor nodded appreciatively, “That is a good question Quinn, I’m not sure. My guess would be that it is by weight, but I couldn’t really say for sure. Though in the specific example of the dagger you would not want to include the leather of the grip in the casting of the foci enchantment. The enchantment would fall apart the first time you needed to replace the grip.”

“What does a Mage need with a dagger anyway Quinn? Any proper Mage wouldn’t be forced to resort to such barbaric measures,” one of my classmates taunted.

“What counts as organic?” I asked, ignoring the comment, “Is charcoal organic?”

“Obviously,” the same student snorted, “I thought Outsiders were supposed to know things.”

“Do I know you?” I asked, turning to the giant knob in gold robes, “Because I think I’ve seen your slightly stunned face elsewhere, but I can’t quite place it.”

“Gentlemen...” our professor warned.

“You saw me yesterday you idiot, I guess humans really are blind,” the Mage said, “I’m Olar, son of Duke Sulia, and you’d better treat me with respect.”

*Oh.*

“Yeah, that made you sit up and take notice didn’t it, you’re a lot quieter now that you know just who it is you’re talking to.”

“Oh shut up,” I said tiredly, “Is charcoal organic as far as foci are concerned?” I clarified, as I dismissed Olar and turned back to the professor.

“Yes,” the professor nodded, as he spared a tired glance for Olar, “Though such a focus would be rather fragile, not to mention messy.”

One of the other students, not Olar this time, piped up, “What about mana stones? You said we could put those in a focus?”

“Ah, now you’re getting to the heart of the matter,” the professor said, as he picked up one of the stave length blanks, “For most of you, or even all of you, a normal focus doesn’t offer a whole lot. You might use it as a status symbol, or a badge of rank, but it doesn’t add a whole lot to your spellcasting. Wizards or less talented Mages will often see a significant increase in their spell’s power or effectiveness when they use a focus, but most of you are naturally talented enough that the difference is negligible. Mishaps will be slightly less common if you use a focus for your spellcasting, but there comes a point where it’s more of a hassle to be carrying your focus around. Unless of course you modify your focus to do more than simply focus your spells.”

“What, so we just pile on a bunch of spell enchantments?” Olar asked, “Firebolt, Lightning Bolt, Teleport and stuff?”

“Essentially,” the professor explained, “Where a Wizard might have a collection of purchased wands, each to cast a spell that he doesn’t himself know, you would have a single wand able to cast multiple spells with more mana than you’d normally have access to.”

“How is that any different from just casting it yourself and using a manastone?” the professor was asked.

“Another good question, why indeed? It’s a matter of how a manastone is used by the wand or staff. A manastone embedded in an item of any sort, whether that be a focus, a magic sword, or a suit of armour, is able to provide its power much more efficiently than a loose manastone. It comes down to one of two options. Either you may attach the stone as a so called ‘dedicated’ manastone, which effectively doubles the amount of mana the stone provides, or you may opt for an ‘exclusive’ manastone which *triples* the mana provided.”

“Triple?” I asked.

*Could I use this to enchant the spellstone? Or even dispel the stasis enchantment? Could I replace the manastone with a bloodstone and turn one soul into three thousand mana?*

“Yes triple,” he agreed, “Though there are limits. In both cases the manastone is only accessible by enchantments cast on the item itself. Consider the following,” he said, holding the blank staff up for all to see, “Imagine that I’ve placed two enchantments upon this staff. The first is the enchantment to turn this into a proper focus, and the second is one that would allow anyone with magical talent to use this staff to cast Firebolt, regardless of whether they knew the spell themselves or not.”

“So it would be like one of the wands of Firebolt you can pick up at one of the shops in town?” I asked.

“Exactly,” he nodded, “Now imagine I attach a dedicated manastone. This manastone is a one point manastone, but as part of the staff it would provide two mana. Now if someone picks this up they’ve got two extra mana with which to cast Firebolt, but not anything else. I could use this staff to focus my casting of Lightning Bolt for example, but I wouldn’t then be able to access the energy in the stone. If I wanted to be able to do that, I’d need to enchant this staff with Lightning Bolt as well.”

“What about enchanting enchantments then?” I asked.

“Enchanting enchantments?” the professor asked.

“Could I enchant a staff or wand to enchant other things, and then do the whole dedicated manastone thing to get more juice for enchanting?” I asked.

“Juice?” he asked with an amused tone, “No, while that would make enchanting a great deal easier, it’s not possible.”

*Damn.*

“Disappointed?”

“Yeah,” I grumbled.

“Perhaps you’ll find some other Outsider trick to apply to enchanting, but I don’t believe that this is such a case,” he went on, “Enchanting isn’t just much more complex than spellcasting, but it also takes a conscious mind. Trust me Quinn, your trick has been tried.”

*Note to self, create magical AI.*

“Alright, now where was I?”

“Dedicated and exclusive stones?” someone asked, “What’s the difference?”

“Ah yes, a dedicated stone is simply a stone that is only accessible by the item it’s attached to. It offers twice as much mana and recharges twice as quickly as well. When using the wand, staff, sword, or what have you, you can draw power from the stone, yourself, other stones you might be carrying, or any combination thereof. And yes, this is the only way to bypass the one manastone limit. An exclusive stone is a different in only two areas. First, as I’ve already mentioned, it is even more efficient. Second, if you include an exclusive stone as part of an item it becomes impossible to provide energy for its enchantments with external sources. Now depending on just what spells you’re planning on enchanting the wand with that might not be too limiting, but it is something to keep in mind at least.”

“Does an exclusive stone also recharge at triple the normal rate?” I asked.

The professor nodded, “Yes, and you touch on an important distinction. A dedicated or exclusive stone does not suddenly become capable of storing two or three times the normal amount of energy, the actual energy contained within remains the same. The enchantments are simply better able to use that same power, so we observe it as an effective two or three fold increase.”

“Just how does the regeneration happen?” I continued, “A normal manastone recharged at a rate of one every twenty four hours, does an exclusive stone recharge three every twenty four, or one every eight hours?”

“What’s the difference?” Olar snorted.

“Too subtle for you to recognize,” I snapped.

“That’s enough,” the professor chided, “And yes, it’s one every eight. The stones recharge gradually over time.”

“What about-” I started.

“Enough Quinn, I am pleased that you take such interest in enchanting, but I must go on, if you have more questions you may ask them after class,” he said in an amused tone, “Now, back to the matter at hand. Over the next several weeks we’re going to work as a group to create a basic focus for each of you, so you’ll want to come up with a solid idea of just what you want placed on the wands or staves you select. You may add whatever you like in your own time, but for the portions of the process that will include your classmates everyone will be limited to two enchantments, beyond the initial casting of Focus.”

We spent the rest of the class learning how to actually cast Focus, until about eleven when the professor called an end to things and we broke for lunch. I glanced at the desk on my way out, but left the blanks where they were. I had a better idea.

*Time to find Nothus.*

---

“You’re shorter than last time,” I said, by way of greeting, as I joined her in our usual spot in the Library.

“You said that last time,” she noted.

“And you were *also* shorter last time,” I insisted, “You’re not that much taller than Victorina now.”

She shrugged, “I don’t need to be a giant to be super strong any more so I’m moving to a size that’s a little more convenient,” she explained, and again I felt like it wasn’t the whole truth, “Now, what do you want?”

If I’d been a little more self centred, or perhaps a little more starved for feminine attention, I would have assumed that she was making the change for my benefit, but that didn’t seem to be the case. She was shorter now, about five foot six, but she hadn’t become any more obviously feminine. She had cut down a little on the excessive bulk, but most people who didn’t know her would still confuse her for a man. Not just because of her overly plain features, but also because of her skeletal structure. Hand her X-Rays to a doctor and they’d probably conclude from the hips, chest, and waist, that she was male. Yes, she was shrinking, but it wasn’t for my benefit. But why the shiftiness then? If she really was downsizing for convenience, why change the subject whenever it’s mentioned?

“Who says I want anything?” I asked defensively.

She didn’t say anything, but glanced up and gave me a wry look.

“Fine, fine, I wanted to know if you can make more of those carbon nanotubes I showed you.”

“Of course I can make more,” she frowned, “I’m doing it now to reinforce my bones, it’ll be another couple of days before its all finished.”

“I meant with a spell, could you create it like you did with the adrenaline?” I asked, “Or even transmute it from charcoal?”

She shook her head, “No, I didn’t bother to create a spell for it. We could,” she offered, “If you wanted to, just like we wrote up the spell to create the adrenaline, but it would take a while, and even once the spell was done we wouldn’t be able to create a lot of it. Not quickly at least, since we’d be creating only a few grams at a time. How much of it do you need?” She asked.

“Enough for a wand,” I sighed.

“That would take... I don’t know, months? Even transmutation wouldn’t make it that much quicker.”

“What about your bones?” I asked, “That hasn’t taken you months.”

“That’s different,” she explained, “And it’s not magic. Transmutation magic could do it almost instantly, and wouldn’t take much more energy than the two of us could provide, but we’d need to invent the spell from whole cloth. We’d need to define the starting material, end material, and every step in between. It’s not as simple as inventing *Transmute to X*, we’d need to invent *Transmute X to Y*. I can do it more quickly because... well, I just can. If I could find some way to make a spell work the same way my shape-shifting does then I’d do it, but I wouldn’t even know where to begin.”

“Damn.”

“We could still do it,” she offered, “I’d love to have a wand like that, it would just take several months.”

“I suppose, for now I might just need to pick up one of those blanks then.”

“Learning how to make your own foci?” she asked.

“Yeah.”

“Hmm, maybe I can make my shape-shifting work for this,” she mused, looking up at me out of the corner of her eye, “You’d owe me one though.”

“Owe you *one*?” I laughed, “Pretty sure I owe you more than one. Minki’s life, my life, my hands...”

“You’ll be able to add your eyes to the list as soon as I can figure out how to heal something that isn’t actually damaged,” she said dismissively, “But I’ll let you pay me in advance for the wand thing.”

“Name it.”

As if on cue, her stomach rumbled loudly, “*FOOD!*”

---

Did she lead me to her favourite restaurant, or a cafe perhaps? No, no she didn’t. When we finally came to a halt, it was outside a butcher’s shop. What did she order you ask?

A fucking side of beef.

Now you might be wondering, “Quinn, just what is a side of beef, isn’t that some cut of steak?”

And I would say no, it’s not any *cut* at all, it’s *all* the cuts. A side of beef is half of a fucking cow.

At least she let me cook it first.

I’d dropped the thing into my Portable Hole and we’d teleported north of the city to set up a damn big campfire. Better to make a mess out in the woods than somewhere in town, and I doubted that Victorina would like the idea of Nothus tearing into the massive hunk of meat in the basement of the clubhouse.

At first I had wondered just where she was going to put it all, but then I noticed the changes. As I watched her devour it all with fascination and horror I saw her muscles become better defined, and her shoulders broadened. Her height too had increased, and by the time she finished her meal she was back to her old self, as she’d been when I’d met her for the first time in healing class.

*That was fast, and her robes kept up with her as she grew, interesting...*

“Give me a day or two,” she yawned, as she stretched out contentedly next to the fire, “And I’ll have a proper wand blank for you.”

“Are you sure you’ve had enough to eat?” I asked, as I kicked at the wreckage of her meal. “I don’t know, maybe you need a little bit more material to work with to make the wand.”

“Oh hush.”

I took a seat on a convenient tree stump, and let out a deep breath. For all I preferred computers and a tidy indoor existence, I enjoyed being outside like this. I was content, and not just in this moment, but in general. Coming to Elardia had been the greatest thing to ever happen to me, yes it had been hard, and I’d been through more in the past several months than most people on Earth went through in a lifetime, but every bit of it was worth it. I’d finally found something that I had true passion for, I had power, money, and I got to have sex with absolutely gorgeous women *really* frequently, which might have been the best part of the whole ‘Outsider’ deal.

*It’s almost like the Olympic village on steroids. A whole city full of people who are as young and beautiful as they want to be, and each one with essentially no consequences for doing as they please. Hell, even if I weren’t an Outsider I bet my luck would be pretty good.*

My self congratulatory back patting was interrupted a little while later by an odd skittering sound in the woods, and I leapt to my feet.

“What is it?” Nothus yawned, barely bothering to stir.

“Something out there,” I whispered, “Probably drawn by the smell,” I said, nodding towards the pile of bones.

Nothus pushed herself up reluctantly, and had a look around, “Can’t see much of anything,” she said quietly, “It’s getting dark, and the forest is pretty thick here.”

“I thought you’d have super eyes,” I whispered back.

“How would I know how to make super eyes?” she hissed.

“I’ll explain after, for now...” there was another skittering sound, and this time I was ready for it.

I thrust my hand forwards to cast Solar Pulse, and I was immediately greeted with three bright flashes and a muffled thud.

Nothus picked herself up off the ground finally, and covered me as I stepped forwards to investigate our attacker.

*Well technically they didn’t attack us, but if Solar Pulse took them down...*

“A ghoul,” I said once I finally made out the shape on the ground just outside of the clearing, “Not a vampire.”

“Either way, we should get back to the University. If we’re running into ghouls this early in the evening they’ve got to be nesting nearby, we ought to let someone know.”

“Alright, do you have somewhere specific you want to be or am I going to do the teleport back?”

“Go ahead,” she said, and I put a hand on her shoulder, and we were gone.

---

“More ghouls?” Halea asked, as she leaned against my desk.

I’d teleported Nothus and I back to the clubhouse’s beacon, and she’d promised to let someone know about the ghouls and then left, before I could reiterate my offer to have her join the club. It was a little while later now, well after the dinner I’d made for myself and the others, and Halea had joined me in my room as we started to wind down for bed.

“Just the one,” I said, “Though there were probably more about. The Guard has been notified, they’ll handle it.”

“Thanks for that by the way,” she said quietly.

“Letting the Guard know? That was Nothus actually.”

“No you big gibbering idiot, not one ghoul you ran across in the forest, the cave. You saved Minki, and *everyone* loves you for that, but you saved me too. There are other healers, but I don’t know anyone else who could have fixed what that ghoul did to me. I probably would have lost my foot if not for you.”

“You’re welcome?” I guessed.

She rolled her eyes, “This is the part where you come over here and take advantage of my gratitude.”

I closed the distance to her quickly, pulling my shirt up and over my head as I did. She shrugged out of her robe and let it drop to the ground in a puddle of silk, revealing that she’d been wearing nothing underneath, and moved as if to meet me halfway. I pushed her back gently with a quickly cast spell, and her rump thumped against the edge of the desk.

I stepped in close, and she reached up, slipping her arms around my neck. She got up on tiptoe to kiss me, and as she did I grabbed her by the back of her thighs, lifting her onto the desk. I kicked out of my loose trousers, and pushed her away gently but firmly until her back was pressed against the cold hard wood of the desk.

She wrapped her legs around me, drawing me in deeply, and I was given a very *firm* reminder of just how strong elves really were. I ran my fingers down her bare stomach, appreciating the strength hidden beneath her soft seeming exterior. I drew my hands down until they rested lightly on her hips, and took a moment to drink her in.

“Are you going to ogle me or sard me,” she taunted, tightening her legs around me.

I took a firm hold of her hips with both hands and set to it, while she thrashed, arched her back, pulled at her hair, and said the most unladylike things.

---

---

Despite Halea’s best efforts, I managed to get a good night’s sleep, and she woke me in her usual fashion in time for me to get a proper breakfast before heading off to the last enchanting class of that week.

“I’m not going to bother you for very long,” the professor explained as the lecture started, “I’m sure you’d all like time to plan out your new foci, and some of you still need time to learn the spells. So I’ll try to keep this quick. What I’ll be covering today are meta and linking enchantments, essentially enchantments that control how and when other enchantments are active or inactive. They’re also fairly cheap to cast, and each of you should actually have the energy to cast it multiple times without assistance. There are multiple versions of the spell, but the concept is simple. You set a criteria, as broad or narrow as you like, and if it is met, your instructions to the item or enchantment are carried out. You may also give instructions for what should happen when your criteria are not met, or if alternative criteria are met.

*If then, else if, else...*

“Professor!” One of my classmates whined, “Quinn’s laughing again!”

---

“What the fuck is that?” I asked incredulously, as I stepped into the little reading nook where the re-biggified Nothus was lounging.

“What does it look like?” she asked smugly.

“It looks like a fucking *femur!*” I exclaimed.

She shrugged, “Yeah?”

“It’s black!”

“You wanted a focus made of carbon nanotubes,” she said simply, “Well there you are.”

“Is that *your* femur?”

“Obviously.”

*Oh for fucks sake.*



# Chapter 73

**Quinn**


---


“You’re a fucking lunatic.”


“And?”


I just shook my head, “Is this the only one, or did you do both legs?”


“This is the only one,” she said, “Oh, did you want another...” she said, as she started reaching for her thigh.


“No! Holy fuck Nothus! That’s not what-”


She laughed, “I’m just sarding with you Quinn, relax.”


I sighed, “Did you replace it at least?”


“Well I managed to make it up the stairs, so I think so,” she told me sarcastically, “Is this going to do the trick then?”


“I think so,” I said, picking the femur up gingerly.


It was incredibly light, and if I hadn’t known better I might have assumed that it was a Styrofoam model. It was a little over half a metre in length, and three or so centimetres in diameter. Theoretically I could Reshape the upper and lower extremities, turning the large knobby bits into more length to make a staff, but that seemed pointless. I needed a focus, but not one so large. A Wizard might get more use out of a staff than he would with a wand, but for a Mage at my level the difference was negligible. Granted, a staff would be a big handy stick to beat people with, but this was so light that it wasn’t really an option. Better then to create a wand, or several wands...


“Nothus, do you have a focus of your own?” I asked, as I considered the dimensions of the femur.


She shook her head, “No, never bothered, and it’s not like I’ve got a big circle of people to help me enchant it anyway.”


“Well there’s probably enough material here for three, maybe four, wands.”


“Might as well I suppose, do you have plans for the rest of it?”


“After we make the first two?” I asked, “Yeah, I want to see how effective a set of symbols I could make.”


She frowned in thought, “Bone *is* one of the materials that can lend more power to the divination.”


“Yeah, and this isn’t just any normal bone either.”


“Well, why don’t you check?” she asked.


“Hmm, that’s a good I idea...” I said, as I fished around in my pouch.


I spoke the incantation, and drew out those symbols that most presented themselves.


---


ᚶᚷ


---


“Well that’s pretty definitive.”


“Strengthen Known,” she read aloud, “That does sound definitive.”


“I guess I know what I’m doing with my evening.”


“Is *that* all?” she teased, and I looked up from the symbols to see that she had an amused light in her eyes.


“I think you already know the answer to that,” I said wryly.


She smiled, “It’s good,” she said, “There was a while there where you always felt a little bit... well, I guess you don’t need me to tell you how you felt. It’s just good that you’re feeling happier now.”


“I suppose it makes me nicer to be around.”


“It does,” she agreed, and then she paused, “...you’re thinking about Andrew.”


“I thought you didn’t read minds,” I noted.


“I don’t,” she replied, “But I know how you feel when you think about him.”


“Caught me,” I admitted.


“You still find it odd that I consider him a friend as well, don’t you.”


“Yeah, I know he’s not a monster, but he is an asshole, and I can’t say I’m that fond of him.”


“Trust me, I know,” she smiled, “And you’re right, he’s not a monster. He has his own troubles, and he is often too willing to take those troubles out on others, but he’s still a good person.”


“Even if he is an asshole.”


She gave me a knowing look, “I’m fairly certain-”


“Alright, alright,” I said, raising my hands in defeat, “I get it, I’m not exactly a paragon of virtue either.”


She shrugged, “Even so, you both treat me with a decency that most elves seem to lack. Though I have no illusions about just why Andrew is so kind to me.”


I raised my eyebrows, “Oh?”


*Now that’s more like what I’d expect out of Andrew.*


“It’s an honest feeling at least.”


“And do you...?”


“Reciprocate his feelings?” she asked, “And how would that make you feel if I did?” she smiled.


“I wouldn’t like it,” I said flatly, “But, I’d deal with it.”


“You don’t want Andrew to be happy?” she asked.


“When you say it like that it almost makes me sound petty.”


“You, petty? *No*, that’s not possible.”

---


It took only a couple of minutes to Reshape the femur into a pair of wands, and I tossed the rest, essentially a bone ingot, into one of my pouches for later. The ingot was just barely large enough that if I was careful I might actually be able to make a third wand in addition to the symbols, and that presented certain opportunities. Rather than decide between an embedded manastone or bloodstone, I could simply have one of each. Of course, if I did embed a bloodstone in one of the wands, I would need to make two, which meant hunting down and sacrificing two stags.


Of course, I could simply purchase usable animals, both for the creation and the charging of the bloodstone, but I did not like that idea.


For the creation at least the chance of discovery was minor. I’d be purchasing one relatively small animal, probably a goat rather than a stag, and I’d probably be able to chop it up and add it to my food stores once the ritual was done. But there was still a chance, there would be one or two people in the world that knew *something,* and while chances were small, the risk was enormous. Simpler then to spend a couple of days traipsing about the forest north of the city. Catch the stag, sacrifice the stag, and then destroy the ritual site and leave the body for the ghouls.


For the charging of the stone... It had to be soul, there was just no other option. Yes, an ox was a theoretical three hundred mana, but if I was only going to get two percent of that it just wasn’t a realistic solution. I’d need fifty oxen just for the spellstone to dispel the enchantment, and another fifteen or twenty if I decided to create a spellstone to cast my modified version of Rend Soul. It wasn’t enough to be present for the creature’s death, to hide on the rooftop of a slaughterhouse or abattoir, and cast the spell with a whispered word or a few gestures. I’d need to do the killing myself, and the ritual would take a couple of minutes *at least* for each animal. And then what the hell would I do with the bodies? Yeah, they’d still be edible, but food preservation was not a well understood art on Elardia, and I’d have forty *tons* of ox to offload. I could sell it, but then there’d be some pretty significant questions asked. Some odd creepy Mage comes in, buys fifty or seventy oxen, and then shows up a few days later with forty tons of ox meat he’s trying to flog? Even if I didn’t sell it back, and dealt with it some other way, I was going to have a hard time disposing of so many bodies, and there’d still be the question of the initial purchase.


*Followed immediately by “what the hell did he do with it all?”*


I could try to buy a slaughterhouse, pass it off as me looking for business interests in the city, but then I’ve got an evil lair. Oh, and it would be a slaughter house that operates without any employees, since I wouldn’t be able to let anyone inside to see how I was killing the animals.


It was a workable problem, and I knew that I’d be able to solve it given time, but it just wasn’t worth it. Filling the stone with soul would be trivial once I had it in hand, and that course of action carried no additional risk. Yes I’d lose a year, but only one year. I was comparing the certain loss of one year, to the possible loss of an infinite number of years. Even if the risk of discovery was infinitely small, it carried and infinitely large penalty.


*And it’s not an infinitely small chance either, I’ve probably still got some of Diova’s cronies following me around and prying into my business. They’d probably have someone take a peek inside if I went with the slaughterhouse solution, especially since they know I was in the tower.*


What I needed was an escape plan. If things really did go tits up, and were absolutely unrecoverable, I needed a way out. I didn’t want to leave Victorina’s club and the friends I’d made there, but if things were bad enough that I was considering my escape route then I’d probably already be in that boat.


*Time then to bite the bullet, and try one of those planeshift spells.*


---


Despite my initial giddiness at finding the spells, I’d been hesitant to cast them. My greatest fear had been that I might not be able to make it back, or that the world I landed in would lack magic, but if I’d been thinking rationally I’d have known that it was safe. Probably. Whoever had wrote the book had made it back after all, and not just from one alternate world, but three.


I made my way out of the city only a little after I finished my little get together with Nothus, and found a place just a little north of the city on a lightly sloping hill. From here I could see the city proper, the two lobed design of the magical and non-magical portions reminding me of a cell undergoing mitosis, along with the large lake that was just south of the city. With the hawk vision amulet active I could even see the Patrician guildhall on the far end of the lake.


From here I’d be able to see any differences between the two worlds immediately, and unless things were too different I’d be far enough from the city not to be noticed.


“Something something, one big step for me, a giant leap or whatever,” I muttered, as I flipped through my phone to find the ritual. It wasn’t a simple matter, stepping across into another dimension, and it wasn’t quick. Teleport’s casting time could be cut down to less than a second if you weren’t going far and put in a little extra energy, that was not the case with Plane Shift. It took me over an hour to finish the casting.


---


The first thing I saw when I blinked into existence on the other side, was the trees.


Lots of trees.


The world I’d selected had been Elardia Primal Alpha, and now I knew why it was referred to as ‘Primal’. Nimre, the city, was gone, and in it’s place was a fucking lot of trees. Rather than stand on the southern edge of the forest, it appeared as if I was deep within. Even with the hawk vision amulet, I couldn’t make out the lake that had lain on the far side of the city, the trees were just too thick.


I turned around slowly, finding yet more of the same thick forests all around, and not much of interest.


For all intents and purposes I was standing on an entirely different *planet*, but I really just felt underwhelmed.


I opened up Excel on my phone, and made some notes as I made made my way back down the slope to where Nimre would be back on Elardia Primary.


I did not find any signs of civilization as I walked through the ‘city’, and not only was there absolutely no construction, I couldn’t see anything to indicate that there had *ever* been anything built on this site. As far as I could tell Elardia Primal Alpha was basically Elardia Primary, minus intelligent life.


Of course, it was also possible that there were elves to be found elsewhere on the continent, or on other continents, but I didn’t really have the means to travel far. Yes, I could teleport, but I’d be doing that without any active beacons so my range would be limited to a couple of kilometres.


I stopped my little walk once I’d reached the shore of the lake, and was not surprised to find thick forest in place of the guildhall that had previously occupied the shore.


*Or is it a bank if it’s a lake? Bank, shore, maybe edge? Whatever. Time for the moment of truth, am I actually going to be able to get home?*


The ‘moment’ lasted over an hour as I ran through the ritual again, but eventually I got through it, and had my answer.


---


*Yes I can, apparently.*


There was the League of Patricians’ guildhall on the far bank, shore, or edge, and upon turning around I was greeted with the sight of the city’s imposing marble walls.


I glanced down at my watch, and it reported that it was 5:34 on November 9th. The time at least was correct, the date however was not. It was close, but we weren’t quite that far into autumn, and it felt more like October at the moment.


No, November 9th was not an accurate record of the current local date, instead it told me how long I’d been on Elardia. January 1st had been that first day I’d woken up after my crash, and the first day I’d met Sila and Harp. With the watch reporting November 9th that made this day three hundred and thirteen, which meant that I’d been at the University for a little over a hundred days.


*Damn, a hundred days? It’s felt a lot longer than that.*


I decided against trying another of the spells, it was getting late, and I’d need another two hours just for the trip there and back. If those other two worlds were anything like the first then I’d be dropping into untamed wilderness, and I didn’t really want a wolf sneaking up on me while I was distracted with the ritual.


I’d wait until tomorrow to check out the other two worlds, and I’d also take the opportunity to try to find a stag. Tracking down fifty wild oxen or a hundred wild deer probably wouldn’t be practical, but at least this way I’d have a way to create it at least without risking discovery.

----

I stepped out of the ensuite, my hair still damp from the bath, to find Halea already nestled in among the folds of silk that covered my bed.

“Mmm, Quinn,” Halea smouldered, “Feel like trying something new?”


“Oh, trying to broaden my horizons?” I asked, as I shrugged out of the bathrobe, and slipped in next to her.


“Something like that,” she said, as she rolled over to plant an elbow on my chest, “Do you know what this is?” she asked, holding up a thumb sized crystal that seemed to be lit from within by a soft pink light.


The crystal reminded me of those that we’d recovered during our ill fated trip to the mine. The ones we’d turned into manastones, and if not for the fact that this one was tinged pink I would have assumed that it was just another manastone. Though this one was strung from a fine gold chain.


“Looks like a pink manastone,” I stated obviously, as I reached up to run a hand through her hair.


“More or less,” she said, biting her lower lip, “This one is special though.”


“How special?” I asked through narrowed eyes.


“Well, it’s recharged in a very interesting way,” she purred, as she slipped her other hand under the covers and along my belly.


“Really?” I asked, suddenly quite interested, but probably not in the way Halea had intended, “Is it also capable of storing more mana than a normal manastone?”


*If this is the Halea version of a bloodstone then maybe... And I’m pretty sure I’d enjoy the process of getting it charged up.*


“Not really,” she admitted, “It’s more of a curiosity than anything else. It probably would have been more practical to turn this crystal into a normal stone, but this is much more *fun*.”


“Damn,” I sighed.


*Looks like I’ve got to go with the bloodstone.*


She must have noticed something, either in my expression or in the lack of *response* to her touch, because she narrowed her eyes, “You have something planned? And you need a lot of mana for this plan?”


“Yeah, and probably all in one shot, which means a damn big manastone of some sort. I might be able to settle for a couple smaller stones, but they’d still need to be able to store a hell of a lot of mana.”


“Mmm, there aren't many substitutes for size,” she smirked, “Size and structure, that’s what matters when it comes to manastones. Gemstones have fantastic structure, but are often quite small. Or you go for something with worse structure, but greater size, like this,” she said, dangling the pink manastone in front of my eyes, “The crystals we recovered aren't worth anything to a jeweler, and their structure is pretty mediocre, but they make up for it in size.”


“What gemstones are usually considered the best?” I asked.


She rolled her eyes, obviously she thought that my priorities were out of order, “Diamonds usually, something about their pure crystal structure, Neferoy could probably tell you more about though. But why don’t we set that aside fo-”


“Diamonds,” I breathed, eyes growing wide.


“For fext’s sake Quinn,” Halea hissed incredulously.


“Diamonds Halea, Diamonds! A diamond is just a crystal of pure carbon, which *means...*”


I turned away from Halea’s admittedly beautiful face to look at one of my armchairs, over which I’d draped my belt of extradimensional pouches. Extradimensional pouches which held an ingot made of pure carbon nanotubes, that was larger even than two of my fists set together.


*Even if it was just a hunk of the same low grade crystal Halea’s little toy is made of... It’s got to be a couple of orders of magnitude larger. And it’s* ***not*** *just a hunk of low grade crystal, it might as well be solid diamond. Hell, it might even be better.*


“Quinn,” Halea sighed, “If there’s something else you’d rather be- Oh!” she yelped, as I rolled the two of us over, leaving myself on top, “*Now* what’s got you all worked up?” she said in an exasperated tone, “Not that I’m complaining.”


“I’ll tell you after,” I said grinning widely, “But I think we’re going to have some work to do.”
